    <div class="article-style"><p>Tom Slee<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<div class="ABSTRACT">
  <div></div>
<p><em>Algorithms that sort people into categories are plagued by incompatible incentives. While more accurate algorithms may address problems of statistical bias and unfairness, they cannot solve the ethical challenges that arise from incompatible incentives.</em></p>
<p><em>Subjects of algorithmic decisions seek to optimize their outcomes, but such efforts may degrade the accuracy of the algorithm. To maintain their accuracy, algorithms must be accompanied by supplementary rules: &ldquo;guardrails”&ldquo;that dictate the limits of acceptable behaviour by subjects. Algorithm owners are drawn into taking on the tasks of governance, managing and validating the behaviour of those who interact with their systems.</em></p>
<p><em>The governance role offers temptations to indulge in regulatory arbitrage. If governance is left to algorithm owners, it may lead to arbitrary and restrictive controls on individual behaviour. The goal of algorithmic governance by automated decision systems, social media recommender systems, and rating systems is a mirage, retreating into the distance whenever we seem to approach it.</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="performances-and-ethics">Performances and ethics</h2>
<p>Individuals present themselves to the world in a set of performances,
and tune their presentation depending on the setting.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> We may not
believe there is a single “real” person behind these performances, but
we do expect to see a &ldquo;coherence among setting, appearance, and manner&rdquo;
(p.25). Individuals whose performances differ too much between one
setting and another risk being called dishonest or two-faced.</p>
<p>Since branding became important to companies, they too have presented
themselves to the world in a set of performances. Financial incentives
demand they tune their performance to the setting&mdash;offering a generous
and humane face in their public communications and a harsher and less
empathetic one when managing the bottom line&mdash;while the ethical demand
for coherence remains. Two decades ago the movement against
corporate-led globalization highlighted these presentation gaps,
captured in the dissonance between Nike&rsquo;s empowering “Just Do It” to
those who bought their sneakers, and the far-from-empowering sweatshop
conditions endured by those who made them.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> One legacy of that
movement is a set of ethical consumption initiatives, in which
independent fair trade and sustainability certifications provide an
opportunity for companies to demonstrate a coherent set of values behind
their performances.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, in the debates over AI ethics, it is technology companies who find
themselves accused of being two-faced, of presenting themselves through
their brands as value-driven organizations while deploying
algorithms<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> that are too often biased, opaque, and unfair.</p>
<p>The debates have taken on new importance following the explosion of
&ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; techniques.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Private sector investment in what is
now often broadly labelled “AI” is dominated by major internet platform
companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft: while
seven billion dollars have been invested in start-ups, these companies
have invested four to five times that amount.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Platform companies
are also leaders in deploying deep learning algorithms: deployments in
other industries are in their early stages, yet many of us encounter
deep learning algorithms daily through Google search, Facebook News
Feed,<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Uber pricing,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Airbnb
search,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and more.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> If this chapter focuses on the major
platform companies, it is because they are charting paths and setting
precedents that more traditional industries will follow.</p>
<p>In response to a series of scandals and compelling arguments from
critics and academics,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> the platform companies have recognized
that they must establish reputations as responsible stewards of these
powerful technologies if they are to avoid a costly backlash. They have
issued public commitments to ethical AI, asserted their belief in
fairness and transparency, and proclaimed their commitment to building
diverse organizational cultures to prevent bias from creeping in to
their technological services and products.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> They have set up
ethics boards and industry organizations such as <em>Partnership on
AI,</em><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> and participated in governmental bodies such as the EU&rsquo;s
High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The platform companies have also taken on the task of designing fairness
into their systems,<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> investing in research into fairness and
transparency in machine learning, articulating statistical criteria for
fairness, designing mechanisms for explaining machine-learning results,
assembling unbiased data sets for key problems, and more. The technical
approach is a good fit: technical criteria play to the strengths of
technology companies. Standards set public benchmarks and provide
protection from future accusations. Auditable criteria incorporated into
product development and release processes can confirm compliance.</p>
<p>There are also financial incentives to adopt a technical approach:
standards that demand expertise and investment create barriers to entry
by smaller firms, just as risk management regulations create barriers to
entry in the financial and healthcare industries.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The challenges of bias and fairness are far from solved, and critics
continue to play an essential role. External investigations, audits and
benchmarks reveal deficiencies missed by internal efforts.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> But
auditable algorithms and data sets do promise mechanisms for closing the
presentation gap between brand and algorithm.</p>
<p>Charges of bias and unfairness expose AI algorithms that are, in some
sense, not good enough, and emphasize that the solution is better
algorithms. But another set of problems may become <em>more</em> significant as
algorithms become more accurate: when they become too good not to use.
This chapter focuses on this second gap, which cannot be translated into
research projects to be solved by computer scientists.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-create-incentives">Algorithms create incentives</h2>
<p>Much debate around AI ethics imagines an algorithm as a camera,
recording and portraying some aspect of the external world. It asks:
does the system portray the world fairly and faithfully? When it
categorizes things, does it do so in a way that corresponds to the real
world?<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Social scientists have long known that algorithms do not just portray
the world, they also change it. In the words of Donald MacKenzie, an
algorithm is &ldquo;an engine, not a camera&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Introducing a new
algorithm means sorting people differently; if people care about how
they are sorted, they respond.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Once people respond, the dynamic between algorithms and their subjects
becomes strategic: economists are familiar with such situations and
developed the tools of game theory to think about them.</p>
<p>Sociologists have shown that responses to algorithms are ubiquitous and
subtle. The most seemingly innocuous decisions prompt changes in what is
being measured. In 1927 Dutch authorities separated the cause of death
entered into statistical records from that recorded on the public death
certificate, a change that was followed by “a considerable increase in
Amsterdam of cases of death from syphilis, tabes, dementia paralytics,
&hellip; and suicide.&quot;<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Why? Because these causes of death could now be
entered into the statistical record without adding to the pain of
newly-bereaved relatives.</p>
<p>Sociologists have also shown how surprisingly powerful algorithmic
engines can be. In their book <em>Engines of Anxiety</em>, Wendy Espeland and
Michael Sauder describe the impact of US News and World Report rankings
on US law schools.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Employers use the rankings to identify good
students, so students rely on them when choosing where to apply, so law
schools who want the best students must play the game, and rankings end
up dominating many aspects of law school life. The dynamic is described
beautifully by Kieran Healy in a review of Espeland and Sauder&rsquo;s book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The academic legal establishment did not so much fall into this trap
as become entangled in it. Like a fly touched by the thread of a
spider&rsquo;s web, they were at first only lightly caught up, but then
found that each move they made in response only drew them in more
tightly.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>

<p>This chapter draws loosely on social science perspectives to sketch what
can happen when we respond to algorithms, and the consequences of our
responses.</p>
<p>Imagine an algorithm that sorts individual subjects into categories. If
subjects care about their assigned category, then they have an incentive
to optimize how they present themselves: changing their inputs to
achieve a better output. Their decision to invest in this presentation
depends on three factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Presentation cost.</strong> The subject must be able to afford to change
their presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensitivity.</strong> Changing an input feature is worthwhile only if it
affects the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact.</strong> Changing an output is worthwhile only if it has significant
consequences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Algorithms with high impact, high sensitivity, and low presentation
costs give subjects strong incentives to change their presentation.
Following the terminology of economics, we can loosely say that such
algorithms have high <strong>elasticity</strong>. The data distributions on which
elastic algorithms operate when deployed will differ from those on which
it was trained. When data distributions change, accuracy is lost:
elastic algorithms may also be <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>
<p>There are reasons to believe that machine learning systems, and
specifically deep learning systems, may be particularly elastic and
fragile, mapping on to each of the factors above.</p>
<p>First is the low cost of experimentation around presentation. Deep
learning techniques called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
have become excellent at generating images or videos or text that look
as if they were created by humans or depict &ldquo;real world&rdquo; artefacts.
These uses have been grouped together under the name &ldquo;deep
fakes&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
<p>There is growing evidence that the remarkable accuracy of deep learning
models may be accompanied by high sensitivity. In 2013 a phenomenon
called &ldquo;adversarial examples&rdquo; was discovered: certain image
perturbations, undetectable to the human eye, nevertheless caused deep
learning algorithms to make obvious mistakes when classifying the image
(as measured by human judgment).<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> An example is given in Figure 2.
The original examples were curiosities,<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> but the more it has been
studied, the more general the phenomenon appears to be.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Fragility
could be a general feature of deep learning models:<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> they
typically optimize millions of parameters, and the more parameters, the
bigger the &ldquo;attack surface&rdquo; as each parameter provides a new opportunity
for subjects to tweak.</p>

<p>Many machine learning systems have high impact because they are deployed
at scale. We may not want to invest in optimizing our LinkedIn profile,
but if we are seeking work and that&rsquo;s where employers look we have
little alternative but to put our best foot forward. Scale also creates
market opportunities for cost-lowering intermediaries who can assist
with optimization, as with search-engine optimization, reputation
management or, come to that, tax accountancy. Scale makes algorithmic
flaws matter more than those of any one human.</p>
<p>As deep learning drives the next generation of decision support systems
and recommender systems, their elasticity and fragility may become
increasingly important. To make matters more serious, these weaknesses
will not show up in proofs of concept or early stage deployments, where
the output has little impact on subjects. It is only when algorithms are
operating at scale that the incentive to invest becomes large, making
the system more fragile.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="incentives-drive-responses">Incentives drive responses</h2>
<p>Figure 3 classifies responses to algorithms. Algorithms require <em>valid</em>
input if they are to give correct output. Algorithms also have an
<em>intent</em> that can be affected positively or negatively by the actions of
subjects. In general, the output is a proxy for this less well-defined
intent.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Each input arrow may be paired with each output arrow,
giving four classes of response. While algorithm designers may prefer to
permit only valid inputs which sustain the intent of the system, all
four combinations can have ethical justifications.</p>
<p>Valid inputs can be understood by thinking about a simple rule-based
system, such as a hiring filter that sorts applicants based solely on
educational achievements. The input is a subject&rsquo;s educational
achievements: genuine achievements are valid and fake achievements are
not. The intent of the system is to give the hiring manager a good set
of interviewees: if he or she is happy with their applicants the
system&rsquo;s intent is satisfied.</p>
<p>In cases that economists describe as separating equilibria for
signalling and screening games,<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> valid inputs sustain the intent
of the algorithm. If the applicant pool consists of two qualities from
an employment perspective (high and low), and if getting a degree is
easier for high quality people than for low quality people, then only
high-quality people find it worth investing in a degree. The beauty of
such an arrangement is that it is &ldquo;incentive compatible&rdquo;: an “invisible
hand” guides subjects so that, if they respond to incentives, the
algorithm continues to satisfy its intent without additional governance.</p>
<p>If it is equally costly for low quality applicants to obtain a degree as
for high quality applicants, then the degree ceases to be a useful
signal. Applicants may continue to invest in degrees, but the algorithm
will no longer separate the wheat from the chaff. This is the
game-theoretic case of a &ldquo;pooling equilibrium&rdquo;, where valid responses
erode the intent of the algorithm. We know how the verb describing valid
responses in pooling equilibria declines: I follow the letter of the
law, you teach to the test, he or she games the system. The problems of
pooling equilibria have been elevated to the status of a Law:
&ldquo;Goodhart&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; states that &ldquo;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases
to be a good measure&rdquo; to which we might add a corollary that becomes
important below: “When a measure is not a target, it ceases to be
optimized”.</p>
<p>The ethics of optimizing responses using valid input is not simple. One
reason Google keeps its search algorithms secret is to prevent gaming by
the search-engine optimization industry,<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> but when it comes to the
tax system their attitude is different. A secret tax system would be
unacceptable, of course. Accused of dodging taxes by moving $23bn to
Bermuda, Google responded simply: &ldquo;We pay all of the taxes due and
comply with the tax laws in every country we operate in around the
world&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Workarounds</em> are a class of invalid inputs that nevertheless sustain
the intent of the system. Legal scholar Jennifer Raso investigated the
operation of Ontario Works, a welfare-eligibility decision
system,<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> and found that case workers became experts at working
with the system, on occasions entering false data to coax results that
line up with their professional judgment. Whether dealing with bugs in
the program (an inapplicable field for some applicants would also be a
required field in the system) or with weaknesses in the model, case
workers break the letter of the law to follow the spirit. Similar
behaviour has been seen among US doctors seeking to provide their
patients with good outcomes from insurance systems.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Any statistical algorithm has error cases, and many systems cannot
function without workarounds from those it manages or their agents,
which is why &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo; actions in some industrial settings are
common: if you follow the letter of the law too strictly, nothing gets
done. The unappreciated role of workarounds is one reason why James C.
Scott argues that “certain schemes to improve the human condition have
failed.”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> Scott is arguing against top-down “high-modernist”
schemes, and algorithmic platforms certainly fall into this category.</p>
<p>The final case is invalid input that also erodes an algorithm&rsquo;s intent,
often described in security terms, as <em>attacks</em> on the algorithm. There
are an increasing number of algorithms for which “opting out” is not an
option, including ratings platforms. <em>Botto Bistro</em> is a San Francisco
restaurant which was unhappy with what they saw as unethical treatment
by Yelp, who also refused the restaurant&rsquo;s request to be removed from
the platform. In response, <em>Botto Bistro</em> encouraged its customers to
enter over-the-top one-star reviews, seeking to achieve the lowest
rating on Yelp. The campaign called attention to some dubious practices
and contradictions in Yelp&rsquo;s operations: perhaps a case of principled
protest or subversive humour, sabotaging one system in pursuit of a
higher goal.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The more sophisticated and complex the algorithm, the more the lines
between these four categories blur. Once algorithms move beyond simple
inputs such as birth dates and educational qualifications, the criteria
for distinguishing valid from invalid input become uncertain. Reputation
systems such as Yelp, eBay, and Uber replace &ldquo;true or false&rdquo; criteria
with more nebulous notions of &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; or &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; and defend
them not by appeals to correctness but to free speech.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Who can
say what a “four-star” rating really means?<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<p>On the output side too, an unambiguous “ground truth” output is often
unavailable outside the labelled training sets of the laboratory, so the
distinction fades between an attack and a workaround. Even adversarial
examples, which seem so obvious, have resisted definition. One technical
attempt is to say they are input “that an attacker has intentionally
designed to cause the model to make a mistake”<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>, but for an
individual real-world case identifying “intent” or “mistake” may both be
impossible, and so the classification of “attacker” fails too.</p>
<h2 id="responses-demand-guardrails">Responses demand guardrails</h2>
<p>In general, algorithms that classify people are
“incentive-incompatible”: if subjects follow their incentives then the
algorithm ceases to function as designed. To sustain their accuracy,
algorithms need external rules to limit permissible responses. These
rules form a set of <em>guardrails</em> which implement value judgments,
keeping algorithms functioning by constraining the actions of
subjects.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>
<p>“Move fast and break things” norms of disruptive innovation encourage
algorithm designers to postpone thinking about guardrails. They may not
be needed in low-elasticity environments such as proofs of concept or in
early-stage deployments. Still, successful deployments at scale will
require guardrails and so, even if problems of bias and fairness could
be solved, the grail of algorithmic governance&mdash;of impartial and
automatic algorithmic data-driven and evidence-based
decision-making&mdash;would fall at this hurdle. Algorithms and their
guardrails form an inseparable pair. Code is law, until it is not.</p>
<p>The existence of a scalable algorithm does not imply the existence of
equally scalable guardrails: guardrails must deal with specific contexts
and factors outside the original model, which only grow in number as
algorithms draw on an ever-increasing volume and variety of data in
pursuit of accuracy. Attempts to implement automated moderation have
repeatedly failed, and companies have resorted instead to what Astra
Taylor calls &ldquo;fauxtomation&rdquo;: behind the scenes real people do the work
to simulate the effects of an algorithm, because the technology is not
up to the task.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> The work of content moderators has been described
recently by Sarah Roberts<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> and Tarleton Gillespie.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Algorithms without guardrails may become ungovernable. Social media
recommender algorithms, for example, have all three qualities needed for
high elasticity. Experimentation is affordable, content producers can
discover the kind of content to which the recommendation algorithm is
sensitive because they get fast feedback in the form of view counts, and
the impact of the recommendation system is high. High elasticity means
strong incentives to optimize individual outcomes.</p>
<p>The YouTube recommendation algorithm<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> suffers from
ungovernability. In a widely read article, James Bridle provided a tour
through the long tail of bizarre content appearing on YouTube Kids as
producers experiment to gain views.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> As just one example, they
would rely on keyword/hashtag association when generating new content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When some trend, such as Surprise Egg videos, reaches critical mass,
content producers pile onto it, creating thousands and thousands more
of these videos in every possible iteration&hellip; branded content and
nursery rhyme titles and “surprise egg” all stuffed into the same word
salad to capture search results, sidebar placement, and “up next”
autoplay rankings&hellip;</p>
<p>A striking example of the weirdness is the Finger Family videos&hellip; I
have no idea where they came from or the origin of the children&rsquo;s
rhyme at the core of the trope, but there are <strong>at least 17 million
versions</strong> of this currently on YouTube, and again they cover every
possible genre, with billions and billions of aggregated views.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, it was Bridle&rsquo;s essay going viral that made YouTube act, and
they did so by invoking community guidelines. The response seems like an
ethical platform making best efforts to implement guardrails that eject
malicious actors, but the story is not so simple. One channel removed
for violating the &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; rule was that of Johnny
Tanner.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> Tanner said he could not discover what had prompted the
punishment, because he had no person to talk to. In defence of his
channel, he said, &ldquo;The algorithm is the thing we had a relationship with
since the beginning. That&rsquo;s what got us out there and popular&hellip; We
learned to fuel it and do whatever it took to please the algorithm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same article quotes Davey Orgill, who left his job to make superhero
parody videos, and whose channel reached two million viewers before
being shut down. He argued that &ldquo;the platform is responsible for
encouraging&hellip; objectionable, sexual, and violent superhero content
ostensibly oriented toward children&hellip; YouTube blames it on these people
that were doing it, but for a year their algorithm pushed this
content&hellip; People were doing it because it was creating millions and
millions and millions of views. They created a monster.&rdquo; The left hand
of the recommendation algorithms promotes videos that the right hand of
the Community Guidelines would later forbid.</p>
<p>Bridle ends his essay this way: “The architecture they have built to
extract the maximum revenue from online video is being hacked by persons
unknown to abuse children, perhaps not even deliberately, but at a
massive scale,” but the disturbing videos are not “hacking” any more
than minimizing tax payments is hacking, they are responses driven by
the algorithm itself.</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s News Feed algorithm also suffers from high elasticity and its
problems have also been framed as those of defence against malicious
actors. Former Facebook executive Antonio Garcia Martinez complained on
Twitter that &ldquo;The same FB [Facebook] critics who call on the company to
take on responsibility for moderating content (an operational job they
(Facebook) don&rsquo;t want, and had to be pressed to perform), will of course
be shocked, shocked at the human cost in reviewing billions of pieces of
random content&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> But the requirement for guardrails .</p>
<p>The intent of News Feed has changed over time and remains operationally
vague. Mark Zuckerberg announced in January 2018 that “I&rsquo;m changing the
goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant
content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions”.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>
Facebook designed News Feed as a system with large rewards for high
circulation, so encouraging participants to invest heavily in optimizing
their outcomes. Attempting to move on from the resulting Clickbait
headlines, Facebook has doubled down on building in-house algorithmic or
fauxtomatic solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the
assumption that people&rsquo;s individual preferences ultimately coincide
with the public good, and that if it doesn&rsquo;t appear that way at first,
you&rsquo;re not delving deeply enough into the data.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption fails. An elastic system based on “the data” causes the
foundations on which it is built to shift. The incentive-incompatible
News Feed algorithm demands guardrails to police the content it
generates.</p>
<p>If Facebook does not want the job of managing news content, it could
hand it to the news industry. Emily Bell of the Columbia Journalism
School explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say,
‘This is good information' and ‘This is bad information.' They have to
say, ‘These are the kinds of information sources that we want to
privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the
platform, but they are not going to thrive.' In other words, they have
to create a hierarchy, and they&rsquo;re going to have to decide how they&rsquo;re
going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.”<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook does want the job, or at least the money that comes with it.
Financial incentives demand that Facebook keep responsibility for News
Feed content, while insisting it has no accountability for the outcome
beyond making best efforts.</p>
<p>Social media algorithms may be particularly prone to driving “gaming”
behaviour, but others are not immune.</p>
<p>The Allegheny Family Screening Tool (AFST) is a decision support system
used to predict child abuse or child neglect at the time of birth, and
to alert child services to children who may be at risk. The attentions
of child services can have a large effect on the lives of families whose
risk score is high. Contact with social services is one factor that may
lead to a high predictive score, so some families feel they must engage
in self-harming behaviour, withdrawing from “networks that provide
services, support, and community” to optimize their score. AFST might
“create the very abuse it seeks to prevent.&quot;<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
<p>Facial recognition has long prompted civil liberties concerns.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>
Guardrails are one of these concerns: is covering one&rsquo;s face acceptable
behaviour around facial recognition software in public spaces? In a
trial deployment in London, police fined a man after he covered his face
and objected to subsequent police questioning.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> More generally, as
the data sources used by insurance companies, potential employers, and
others expand, the potential for unusual or unorthodox behaviour
patterns to trigger inferences, for example based on outlier detection
algorithms, expands in tandem. Without protection against such
inferences, the unusual becomes the suspicious.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> If the guardrail
question: “what have you got to hide” becomes legitimate for authorities
to ask, the technology will have altered public norms for the worse.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles will need new guardrails to manage pedestrian
behaviour. At current levels of deployment, pedestrians will behave much
as they do around cars with drivers, but if self-driving becomes
commonplace then some may optimize their experience by stepping out
ahead of autonomous cars, in full confidence that the car will stop.
Should such pedestrian assertion become the norm, &ldquo;autonomous vehicle
adoption may be hampered by their strategic disadvantage that slows them
down in urban traffic&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> Perhaps, says Drive.ai board member
Andrew Ng, &ldquo;we should partner with the government to ask people to be
lawful and considerate&hellip; Safety isn&rsquo;t just about the quality of the AI
technology.&quot;<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> We can expect the self-driving car industry to seek
new guardrails that protect their own algorithms, yet discussion of
these guardrails are largely missing from conversations about the ethics
of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>In short, guardrails limit the autonomy of algorithmic subjects.
Algorithmic governance may encourage platforms to innovate with A/B
testing on their subjects, but the subjects themselves are constrained.
Some may be punished twice over: once by the algorithm for unorthodox
behaviour that it does not properly model, and a second time if they
fall foul of the guardrails while trying to avoid the first.</p>
<h2 id="guardrails-create-temptation">Guardrails create temptation</h2>
<p>The algorithm-guardrail pairing creates temptations for platform owners
to indulge in arbitrage: exploiting presentation gaps to circumvent
regulation and to avoid brand damage. When algorithms encourage
behaviour that the guardrails forbid, platform companies may choose
whether to present themselves through their algorithm or through the
values imposed by their guardrails. Ethics calls for a consistent
presentation, but companies have a financial incentive to keep the gap
wide, and many activities can be seen in this light.</p>
<p>One response is to frame problems in terms of the software development
lifecycle. Problems are bugs, and the software industry knows how to
deal with bugs: they are reported, they are fixed, and fixes are rolled
out to customers. It is a statement of faith that bugs are temporary,
and software improves through iterative refinement. If algorithmic
failings are bugs, external authorities have neither the jurisdiction
nor the expertise to fix them. But as we have seen, guardrail failures
are features not bugs: they are created by the incentives built into the
algorithm. In her book “Uberland”, Alex Rosenblat talks of Uber drivers
seeing &ldquo;phantom requests&rdquo; that appear briefly on the driver app but
vanish before they can respond.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> Phantom requests damage drivers'
prospects of earning bonuses that depend on maintaining a high
acceptance rate. Uber&rsquo;s response to driver complaints was to blame it on
network problems and promise a fix. Without effective person-to-person
driver support, Uber denies drivers the option of a workaround, while
the language and practices of software development helps the company
avoid what would, in other companies, be a breach of contract with their
drivers.</p>
<p>A second response is to invoke value-based guardrails in an ad-hoc
manner. If algorithmic governance leads to behaviour on the part of
subjects that may damage the brand, it is tempting to let it go until
the prospect becomes too dangerous. YouTube&rsquo;s actions around the YouTube
Kids channel fall into this pattern.</p>
<p>Airbnb is an algorithmically-governed platform with a stated intent of
the building a community of regular people who live in their own home
and occasionally share it with strangers. Any guardrails to keep
behaviour within this mandate runs the risk of affecting Airbnb&rsquo;s
earnings, and so there has been nothing in Airbnb&rsquo;s systems to stop
hosts creating multiple listings, setting up organizations with
different &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; as fronts,<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup> or renting out listings for 365
nights a year. When the gap between algorithmic practices and stated
aims became too large in New York City, bringing the threat of
restrictions on Airbnb&rsquo;s market, the company invoked guardrails to expel
a thousand hosts off its platform,<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> claiming that they were not
providing the experience their community expected.<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> Code was
overruled by brand.</p>
<p>A third temptation is to use the platform&rsquo;s information resources to
hide or muddy the waters regarding algorithmic failures. Ryan Calo and
Alex Rosenblat have detailed the many ways in which Uber has used its
information to shape the behaviour of its drivers.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> The selective
and judicious release of data on an exclusive basis for collaboration
with academics or industry experts may also serve to shape the overall
perception of the company, whether individual papers are written
independently or not.</p>
<p>Finally: companies that become embedded into the infrastructure of our
lives have leverage when it comes to the presentation gap. Uber seeks to
become a privately-owned part of city transit infrastructure and uses
the data it has accumulated as a resource to be licensed back to the
cities in which they operate. Once integrated, cities cannot easily walk
away from the platform, problems on the platform become public concerns
regarding malicious actors, and cities' leverage regarding governance on
the Uber platform is lost. Smart City initiatives such as the Toronto
project led by Google subsidiary Sidewalk implicitly adopt this same
approach.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="temptation-needs-policing">Temptation needs policing</h2>
<p>The more powerful algorithms have become, the more it is clear that
market forces alone cannot solve the problems arising from the
incompatible incentives.</p>
<p>Platform companies can sustain a gap between algorithm and guardrail in
part because Section 230 of the CDA absolves them of much responsibility
for the consequences of their governance failures, in the USA at least.
Chesney and Citron&rsquo;s recent paper on Deep Fakes<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> identify the
platform companies as the &ldquo;least cost avoider&rdquo;: the actor who is in the
best position to fix problems of incompatible incentives. The previous
section claimed that platforms currently have an incentive to take
ownership of the problem, but not to fix it: that taking ownership is
currently a way to ward off regulation. Revisiting Section 230 and its
equivalents in other jurisdictions does the opposite.</p>
<p>One of society&rsquo;s most serious classification problems is that of
“innocent or guilty”, and it worth remembering that data-driven
statistical methods are not permitted in this venue: evidence is instead
strictly limited in scope. One reason is that people should not be
punished for factors that, while they may correlate with criminality,
lie outside their control. Another is that it would demand that people,
especially members of less privileged groups, invest in optimizing their
risk scores for fear of contact with the criminal system.
“Evidence-based” statistical decision-making has become increasingly
used in areas of the justice system such as parole and even sentencing
and its use raises both problems. While the trend remains towards
data-driven decisions, voices are being raised against use of actuarial
risk assessment in the justice system.<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> Restricting data use goes
against the grain of the current drive to a data-driven society, but as
the impact of algorithmic decisions grows, ideas from this venue where
decisions matter the most may become more prominent in the years to
come.</p>
<p>Competition rules provide another avenue to resolving incentive
problems. Algorithmic ranking systems can become powerful institutions
in and of themselves: part of the infrastructure of society. Advantages
accrue to the company that owns the infrastructure when it is also
competing in the market for services that exploit that
infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup></p>
<p>In some industries the essential infrastructure is heavily regulated and
controlled, while services built on that infrastructure are opened for
innovation. Airport infrastructure is separated from the operation of
airlines. Core banking functions are strictly regulated &ndash; perhaps not
as strictly as some would like &ndash; while many countries are experimenting
with open banking laws to permit innovation on top of this
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Outside the realm of regulation, we can look to alternative models.
Wikipedia is the only non-profit in the top ranks of web sites, and it
has been significantly less affected by the problems of incompatible
incentives. Many, the present author included, thought that Wikipedia
would be unable to maintain quality over nearly two decades, but it has
proven sceptics wrong. Perhaps the anonymous nature of contributions
removes many of the distorting incentives associated with
self-promotion, perhaps it&rsquo;s because Wikipedia is largely free of
“viral” phenomena, but something is working on Wikipedia that is not
working at YouTube, Facebook, or Amazon.</p>
<p>In conclusion, deep learning algorithms may be more intelligent than
previous generations of machine learning, but they are not more robust.
There may be a faint technical path forward for problems of bias and
unfairness, but algorithms are engines, not cameras, and pervasive
incompatible incentives will remain. Algorithms require guardrails, and
technology companies are ill-suited and ill-positioned to design or
implement these value-based rules. Guardrails become constraints on
people&rsquo;s behaviour and yet, in cases of high elasticity, effective
governance may still be elusive. The pairing of the algorithm and
guardrails tempts companies to engage in regulatory arbitrage, providing
a requirement for external action.</p>
