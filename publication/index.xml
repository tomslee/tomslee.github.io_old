&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essay based on a presentation to the Symposium of the Ernst Schmidheiny Foundation,
Friday November 23, 2018. 9:20am—10am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now ten years since some of the best known Sharing Economy
companies were founded, and about six years since the name &amp;ldquo;Sharing
Economy&amp;rdquo; became used to identify this wave of internet companies. In
that time we have seen claims that this is a new model of employment,
even that it is the future of work, and that it is fundamentally
changing the cities in which we live. But in recent years we&amp;rsquo;ve also
seen signs of a bubble. A few years ago the story of the Sharing Economy
would have been simple: here is a new model, and some people like it and
some do not, but it works. Now there is more scepticism, and the phrase
itself may be fading from public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay gives a quick tour of the sharing economy, from its
beginnings after the 2008 financial crash to today. I will walk through
some of the business models and some of the economics of this sector,
and sketch some of the controversies. There is another theme to the
essay, which is &amp;ldquo;who makes the future?&amp;rdquo; Is the world of work, for
example, built by technology companies in Silicon Valley, or can the
rest of the world have a say as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2008-beginnings&#34;&gt;2008: Beginnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at three companies which each started just about ten years
ago and which had a similar business model in common, even though the
people involved did not know each other at all. There was no name for it
at the time, but there was something in the air&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Airbnb, which you will probably know is the
controversial short-term rental or holiday accommodation company, where
people rent out residential homes for use by tourists and other
visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, newly graduated design students Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia
were looking for ways to make their end-of-month rental payments in San
Francisco when an industry conference came to town. They bought some
inflatable airbeds and offered accommodations to attendees looking for a
cheap place to stay. They were inundated with requests and realized
there may be a market for this kind of thing, and so &amp;ldquo;Airbed &amp;amp;
Breakfast&amp;rdquo; was born. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the story has been one of hard work and growth. Running up
the limit on multiple credit cards to finance the very beginnings, they
got an early investment from Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Y-Combinator&lt;/em&gt; fund.
Struggling to get the site to take off, they went out to their biggest
city (New York) and got the hosts to have professional photos taken of
their rooms to make them more appealing; the bookings increased, and
professional photography continues to be the most effective way for a
host to attract guests. Other maneuvers included a breakfast-cereal
pitch around the Democratic convention in Chicago and a widely
criticized email campaign via Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the early tribulations, the now-trio of Chesky, Gebbia, and Nathan
Blecharczyk found themselves at the head of a phenomenon. In 2011 Airbnb
had 50,000 listings; in 2012 that number more than doubled to 120,000;
by the end of 2013 it was 550,000; in 2018 it is nearly 5 million
listings. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For comparison, the largest hotel company in the world by
number of rooms is the InterContinental Group with 775,000 rooms. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Airbnb was getting started, two entrepreneurs were attending a
conference in Paris, and had a hard time finding a cab. These two were
Travis Kalanick, who was to go on to be the controversial CEO of Uber,
and Garrett Camp. They didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about paying rent, as both
were already rich from earlier technology ventures. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be
great, they thought, if you could get a cab just by pressing a button on
the newly released iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its early days, Uber worked with limo companies to provide drivers,
but then they realized that a competitor named Lyft was using amateur
drivers rather than professionals, and Uber did not want to be left out.
So they set up Uber X, which is Uber Pop in most of Europe, and opened
up their business to independent drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber&amp;rsquo;s growth has been even more dramatic than that of Airbnb. The
company has raised investment money like no other, raising tens of
billions of dollars in investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our third example is less well known now, but it was often talked about
as another archetype of the Sharing Economy. Here is how the company&amp;rsquo;s
web site described the founding story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a cold night in Boston in February of 2008 when Leah Busque
realized she was out of dog food for her 100-lb yellow lab, Kobe. Leah
thought to herself, &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if there was a place online I
could go to connect with my neighbors&amp;mdash;maybe one who was already at the
store at that very moment&amp;mdash;who could help me out?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this experience, TaskRabbit (formerly RUNmyERRAND), an online and
mobile marketplace that connects neighbors to get things done, was born
&amp;hellip; Neighbors helping neighbors&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s an old school concept
reimagined for today. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the typical tasks that people helped with was assembling Ikea
furniture. TaskRabbit had early successes and attracted a lot of
attention, but in the end it did not become the kind of global company
that Airbnb and Uber have become. Instead, after several years as an
independent company, it sold itself to Ikea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people&amp;rsquo;s problems don&amp;rsquo;t turn into multi-billion dollar companies.
Timing --- whether by luck or by skill &amp;ndash; was essential to their
success. Here is a set of things that had been put in place in the few
years before 2008, each of which was needed for Airbnb and Uber to take
off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broad-band internet. Many homes had computers, and many people were
increasingly comfortable with the Internet as a part of their daily
lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online payments. People were also getting used to using credit cards
on the Internet to pay for their purchases at Amazon, eBay, Expedia
and other early successes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile computing. Beyond that, we were entering the era of the
smartphone. The iPhone was released in 2007 and Uber, for one, could
not have been invented before the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media. In the early years, pseudonyms and anonymity were the
norm on the Internet. As the famous cartoon caption went: &amp;ldquo;On the
Internet, nobody knows you&amp;rsquo;re a dog&amp;rdquo;. But starting with Facebook in
2006, many people were getting used to the idea of using real names.
TaskRabbit and Uber&amp;rsquo;s competitor Lyft both hooked into Facebook&amp;rsquo;s
user identification system as a part of their business model, and
Airbnb and others used Facebook accounts as proof of identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rating systems. The use of ratings, particularly for Netflix movies
and Amazon books, but also through sites such as Yelp and
Travelocity, had spread and the five-star rating that is now
ubiquitous was becoming common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing. Starting in 2006 Amazon started renting out
computer usage from its own massive data centres at bargain prices,
starting the era of cloud computing. This meant that new companies
could start up without buying expensive hardware: they could use
Amazon for their computing needs and get started much more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourcing. The basic computing architecture of the Sharing
Economy is the &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; where the company itself runs the
software, but those who provide the content come from outside. The
success of Wikipedia showed this could be done, and eBay showed you
could build a valuable company that way. YouTube was and continues
to be a remarkable example of this crowdsourced structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though these were all present, the Sharing Economy brought with it
the shock of the new --- pressing a button on your phone and seeing a
car appear seemed like magic, and booking to stay in somebody&amp;rsquo;s house
half way around the world opened up new possibilities for travel. The
novelty of the experiences gave the new services an aura of cool, and
many people immediately thought: this is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2010-2015-rise&#34;&gt;2010 &amp;ndash; 2015: Rise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb and Uber were not founded as Sharing Economy companies, because
the name did not exist. In the years 2010 to 2012 a set of other
companies were founded using a similar business model and commentators
looked for names to describe this trend. &amp;ldquo;Collaborative economy&amp;rdquo;^1^,
&amp;ldquo;circular economy&amp;rdquo;, &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;ldquo;the mesh&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were all put forward, but in
the end the Sharing Economy won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a one-sentence description of the Sharing Economy, it may be
&lt;em&gt;Internet platforms for real-world services&lt;/em&gt;. The first few years of the
century had seen internet platforms for retail (Amazon and eBay), for
social media exchanges and advertising (Google and Facebook), and for
media (Netflix, Apple, YouTube). Of particular interest were eBay and
YouTube: crowdsourced platforms where the content seemed to appear by
magic. The Sharing Economy takes this model, but instead of uploading
videos the platform is used for people who provide real-world services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far can crowdsourced Internet platforms go? Can their economic
benefits be applied to the service economy too? That&amp;rsquo;s what the Sharing
Economy phenomenon asks us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 report for the World Economic Forum gives a three-point
definition.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; First is &amp;ldquo;The use of digital technologies to match
buyers and sellers,&amp;rdquo; which is similar to the point above. But they add
two other components. One is &amp;ldquo;Capitalizing on idle capacity&amp;rdquo;: the
service providers are generally offering something they already own, but
which they are not using right now. So the service providers are not
employees of the platform owners, they are independent actors who are
making use of their own assets. To go back to our three stories: perhaps
they have a car, and can drive for Uber; perhaps they have some spare
time and can run some errands for TaskRabbit; perhaps they have a spare
room and can put it on Airbnb. The other additional point is &amp;ldquo;trust
verification&amp;rdquo;, to which I&amp;rsquo;ll return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this framework, let&amp;rsquo;s look at some examples of companies that
started up in those years of 2010 to 2012. This was the era when
seemingly a million start-up plans were pitched as the &amp;ldquo;Uber for this&amp;rdquo;
or the &amp;ldquo;Airbnb for that&amp;rdquo;. But I want to start with something that is the
opposite. The Toronto Tool Library&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a non-profit organization that
lets people rent tools for home projects. The organization is
geographically limited and community focused: it has no plans to drive
major stores out of business or to become a global behemoth. But it
matters to the story of the Sharing Economy because it draws on one of
the early images that promoted the idea, which is the story of the power
drill.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many of us have a hand drill that sits on a shelf and is
hardly ever used and Rachel Botsman, who was one of the early promoters
of the Sharing Economy and helped to articulate it as a new development,
says: we don&amp;rsquo;t really want a drill, what we want is the hole it makes.
So why not share a drill instead of owning it? Sharing is sustainable,
it helps us get off the consumerist track of ownership, weighed down by
our goods. The drill was the embodiment of using &amp;ldquo;idle capacity&amp;rdquo;. It has
an appealing sustainability angle to it and also hints to a concept
called &amp;ldquo;access over ownership&amp;rdquo;: we don&amp;rsquo;t have to buy in to the bourgeois
and consumerist culture of ownership, we can tread more lightly on the
earth by dipping in and out of these sharing arrangements instead. It
was a catchy and attractive image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Airbnb was already taking off, and a natural extension of that
idea was to share meals. Airbnb said &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t need hotels, you just
need a platform where you can connect with other people.&amp;rdquo; Cookening,
Feastly and other sites applied the same logic to restaurants. If you
are travelling to a new city, why not eat like a local in their own
house? Again, the appeal here is to authenticity, to personal connection
rather than institutions and companies, and to the unusual combination
of small and big that crowdsourcing requires: many small individual
exchanges building a global platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools and meals are fairly low risk, banged thumbs and food poisoning
aside, but finance is surely something different. Remember that we are
talking about a period right after the financial crisis, when personal
finances were stretched and banks were viewed with suspicion. So
companies like Lending Club took a lead from charities such as Kiva,
which focused on direct person-to-person donations, as well as from
initiatives like the Grameen bank, which used social lending to pioneer
the idea of microfinance, and whose founder Mohammed Yunus won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 2006. The idea behind peer-to-peer lending was that
individuals could lend to each other, combining social purpose and sound
investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the question of trust is at its most severe. What happens if I take
a loan from you and don&amp;rsquo;t pay it back? How do you assess credit? The
early players in this industry like Lending Club and Prosper were
experimenting with a variety of approaches, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that
worked out later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to finish, let&amp;rsquo;s go back to household services like TaskRabbit. A
lot of companies started in this area. One is Homejoy, which was
Google&amp;rsquo;s venture into housecleaning &amp;ndash; an eyebrow-raising idea in
itself. Another was Handy, which looked to broaden from cleaning to
other services like plumbing and carpentry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there were lots of others. A short list would include DogVacay,
which was often written about to show the quirky and personal aspect of
the market. Instacart and Deliveroo highlighted the food delivery area,
which is still going strong. BlaBlaCar is a French service for taking
rides from city to city. ZipCar was important as one of the first
carsharing companies, and it preceded most of the others here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 to 2015 various lists of Sharing Economy companies were
published, and they often had hundreds of examples. But for some
analysts, this was just the beginning. PwC is one of the most
consistently upbeat forecasting agencies around the Sharing Economy, and
have forecast markets sizes well into the hundreds of billions of
dollars in a few years time. It looks like the Sharing Economy is taking
off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those specific examples in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s take one more look at a
definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have the platform, and that&amp;rsquo;s the Sharing Economy company.
Perhaps it is Homejoy, or DogVacay, or Lending Club. It matches service
providers to consumers. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take on providing the service itself,
but it does handle payments, identity verification, and ratings. Rating
systems were often called out as one of the main innovations of the
Sharing Economy. &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist Thomas Friedman lauds
&amp;ldquo;Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s real innovation&amp;mdash;a platform of &amp;lsquo;trust&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;where everyone could
not only see everyone else&amp;rsquo;s identity but also rate them as good, bad or
indifferent hosts or guests. This meant everyone using the system would
pretty quickly develop a relevant &amp;lsquo;reputation&amp;rsquo; visible to everyone else
in the system.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Friedman was writing just a couple of weeks after
his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; stablemate David Brooks described &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;How Airbnb and
Lyft Finally Got Americans to Trust Each Other&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;: &amp;ldquo;Companies like Airbnb
establish trust through ratings mechanisms &amp;hellip; People in the Airbnb
economy don&amp;rsquo;t have the option of trusting each other on the basis of
institutional affiliations, so they do it on the basis of online
signaling and peer evaluations.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the consumer side we have seen that the Sharing Economy fits into and
help to shape a trend of particularly young people as valuing
experiences over ownership, and choosing access over ownership. Your
books and music may already be on devices: why buy a car when you can
take an Uber? Everything you need is on your phone or your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there are the service providers, who are presented as partners
rather than employees. The word that used early on was
&amp;ldquo;micro-entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;: not really companies, not really private
individuals, but somewhere in between. And by making the most of their
unused assets they were being green, building community, and making a
little money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;business-models-and-strategy&#34;&gt;Business models and strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all sharing economy business models are novel, or successful, but
when it comes to strategy there are some distinctive features for this
sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal of platforms to investors lies in the idea of increasing
returns to scale. There is a popular phrase that you may have seen. The
biggest hotel company -- Airbnb -- owns no property. The biggest taxi
company -- Uber -- owns no cars. This mimics the way that Facebook and
YouTube own no content. Each is as big as the biggest company in their
market. The value, it seems, is in the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of this model is that if a company sees demand, it
can grow very quickly and globally. Just as other Internet companies
have spread around the world, so can Airbnb and Uber. If a hotel chain
wants to add another 100 rooms it has to build a hotel, but for Airbnb
it&amp;rsquo;s just another row in a database. So on the supply side there are
benefits here, sometimes labelled as a &amp;ldquo;zero marginal cost&amp;rdquo; business
structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are increasing returns on the demand side as well as on the supply
side, and they go under the name network effects. Renters want to be
where travellers are, and travellers want to be where renters are. So
just like social media, every person who takes a trip on Airbnb, and
every person who adds a listing, makes it more attractive for everyone
else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things about increasing returns to scale is that it makes it
difficult for new companies to enter the market: it favours a natural
monopoly, or at least oligopoly. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix have few real
competitors. And this industrial organization makes profits possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero marginal costs and network effects: put the two together and you
can see why investors are enthusiastic. Can Airbnb and Uber do for
services what Amazon has done for retail, what Wikipedia did for the
encyclopedia, and Apple and Spotify have done for music? Is the market
in these services a winner-take-all? The large scale of venture capital
investment shows that a lot of people are prepared to bet that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a real pressure among startups to grow quickly, and one of the
strategies that gained prominence early was a piece of advice given to
Airbnb by their early investor Y Combinator: do things that don&amp;rsquo;t scale.
&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a company starts, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the benefit of network effects so
it can&amp;rsquo;t rely on them. Instead it needs something different to set
itself apart and get growth started. For Airbnb that was visiting hosts
in its first significant market, and helping them present their listings
in an attractive way on the site. Paying for a photographer was a big
step forward: it made a big difference to those early listings and got
the idea of homesharing started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course in business everyone wants a winning formula, and applying
it blindly is rarely successful. Another Sharing Economy company,
Washio, set out to do the same as Airbnb but for laundry: the company
was going to &amp;ldquo;demolish laundry&amp;rdquo;. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They gave each customer cookies,
and packaged the laundry with sleek black bags. But it turned out that
the ideas of the Sharing Economy don&amp;rsquo;t really work for laundry. To start
with the cost side: most of the cost is involved in actually doing the
laundry and digital technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t help with that. On the demand
side: just because other people are doing their laundry through Washio
doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a big difference to me, so network effects were limited.
And because of that, the strategy was just losing money on every sale.
Washio ceased operations in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of business strategy that was central to the
growth of the Sharing Economy. I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on it a couple of times.
Many of these companies did not just see themselves as businesses, they
were also a movement: brands with a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies fostered a community of so-called micro-entrepreneurs and
leaned heavily on ideas of democratization. Instead of relying on
faceless corporations we can now provide services to each other, in a
&amp;ldquo;peer to peer&amp;rdquo; fashion. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a bank to get a loan, you don&amp;rsquo;t
need a hotel to take a holiday, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a taxi to get across
town, you just go to the Internet and click or tap. The idea appeals to
those already invested in new technologies: the old rules don&amp;rsquo;t apply,
we have a better way now. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said that most of the
reasons for regulation in the accommodation and transport spaces were
consumer protection, and reputation systems could carry out that task
better than cities. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Sharing Economy shared a moment with the growth of Wikipedia,
with the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and the idea of Facebook
revolutions and social media as a democratizing force in politics. The
internet was no longer this place you went to when you sat at a desk, it
was moving into the real world, and taking its values with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from the beginning there were tensions built into the Sharing
Economy, and the name captures the problem. Is this about a community or
a business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand it&amp;rsquo;s about sharing: it&amp;rsquo;s social, it&amp;rsquo;s community-focused,
and personal. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s an economy: it&amp;rsquo;s about market
transactions and prices, where scale is the key to profit and perhaps to
monopoly rents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tensions were captured in an organization set up in 2013 called
Peers. It called itself a grassroots movement set up to clear out
old-fashioned regulations and clear a path for the new sharing economy
companies. But it was founded by Airbnb, whose goal was to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the companies were touted as democratizing, but were
set up with the goal of making money for investors, including some of
the richest people on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an attitude that has been called the Californian Ideology, &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
which is that you can have both. You can be rebellious,
anti-establishment, and against hierarchy; but you can also make a big
pile of money while doing it. You can be ethical, and live a life of
purpose, and you can be rich beyond your wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some early examples showed that you cannot have everything, and when
it comes to choosing between community and profit, commercial
enterprises will choose profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;fall&#34;&gt;Fall?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that gives an idea of the ideas behind the Sharing Economy. It&amp;rsquo;s
been ten years now, and there has been a perhaps-inevitable shakeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of the &amp;ldquo;Uber for X&amp;rdquo; companies, like Washio, the promise of new
efficiencies has proved hard to achieve. The unpleasant surprise was
perhaps told best by Sarah Kessler, who went back to look at the story
of the drill. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She showed that many of those companies who were
looking to follow the Sharing Economy template were not growing fast.
Going across town to get a drill from someone you don&amp;rsquo;t know when you
can buy one for \$50 was too much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already seen that Washio went bust because its business model
did not reflect reality. Laundry, it turns out, is laundry. In the same
way, the cleaning company Homejoy was set up with \$30 million from
Google Ventures, but any efficiency it gained came at the cost of its
cleaners, who were reported in one revealing article as living under
bridges. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The cost of cleaning is what you pay the cleaners. The
Internet only helps with that if you can push costs, like the time to
travel, onto the cleaners. And obviously they did not want to bear that
cost, so Homejoy had a hard time keeping staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the problem is that once a homeowner has found a good cleaner,
they probably want the same one again, so the matching problem is not a
huge benefit, and if the cleaner is really a micro-entrepreneur, then
the homeowner can just make a deal with them directly and cut out
Homejoy&amp;rsquo;s portion of the cost. Homejoy went out of business a few years
to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies had to carry out what technology companies call a
&amp;ldquo;pivot&amp;rdquo;: change their business model to something different. TaskRabbit
has sold itself to Ikea, and Instacart has partnered with grocery
chains, so both are now a source of cheap labour for orthodox businesses
rather than a peer-to-peer alternative. Perhaps the biggest pivot was in
the &amp;ldquo;peer-to-peer lending&amp;rdquo; market. The companies struggled with high
rates of default, and ended up changing the name to what they call
&amp;ldquo;marketplace lending&amp;rdquo;. Most of the loans for these companies now come
from regular financial institutions, rather than individuals. The role
of the platforms has changed to be that of an automated loan officer:
algorithmically assessing the credit-worthiness of applicants, and
supplying those assessments to the financial institutions who can decide
whether or not to make the loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this tell us? For many companies, the Internet has not been
the game changer they thought. For others, the Internet has worked, but
they have had to move from the Sharing Economy model. And that leaves us
focusing again on the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2018-full-circle&#34;&gt;2018: Full circle?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 it seems like we are nearly back to where we started: left with
two successful industries&amp;ndash; ridesharing and short-term rentals. There is
Airbnb and there is Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the overall phenomenon of the Sharing Economy may be fading,
these two are still growing rapidly. A look at their success is still
valuable because of their size and impact, and also because some of the
aspects of their business is a first look at the next wave of
innovation, in which the service providers themselves are algorithms
instead of people. The world of autonomous vehicles and AI services will
be platform-based businesses that face many of the same challenges as
the Sharing Economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like Airbnb and Uber are two cases where the Sharing Economy
model worked: zero marginal costs and network effects combining to give
runaway success. But for Uber at least, it may be too early to say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber is often described as a company like Amazon, or Google, or Apple:
one that has changed the nature of the world in which we live. It is
easy to forget that Uber is still not a profitable company, and as
financial quarter after quarter goes by with large losses (over \$1
Billion in 2018 Q3 &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), it is becoming increasingly doubtful whether
its business model is sustainable. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber&amp;rsquo;s challenge is to keep both drivers and riders happy. If it raises
prices it loses riders and if it keeps them low then driver retention
becomes a challenge. Much of the early enthusiasm for the company
assumed that this balancing act was solvable because of the huge
efficiency increases that Uber was bringing to the industry, helping
riders and drivers find each other and eliminating idle time for
drivers. The enthusiasm peaked with a 2014 report in the Washington Post
suggesting that some Uber drivers were earning \$90,000 a year, &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
but that story quickly vanished and now the stories are far more often
about drivers earning less than minimum wage, or facing financial
difficulties because they are unable to keep up payments on a leased
car. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far Uber has solved its problem by throwing money at it. Uber
subsidises rides by providing enticements to the drivers, burning
through billions of dollars of capital while looking with increasing
desperation for a profitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent reports from New York City suggest that Uber and Lyft cars are
empty for at least as much of the time as the traditional &amp;ldquo;yellow
cabs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is not the case everywhere, but it suggests that
efficiency in its current market is not likely to drive profitability.
Maybe squeezing more out of drivers will be a way to do it? Uber is
investing in dynamic pricing, driver incentives, and a myriad of other
techniques for taking more out of every rider&amp;rsquo;s dollar &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but we
should not be too quick to assume they will succeed. It remains possible
that Uber is a blip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Airbnb is profitable, but that is a low bar to reach for a
company valued at \$31 Billion, whose repeated attempts to break into
&amp;ldquo;whole trip&amp;rdquo; planning and business travel have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, both these companies have shown that rapid and global growth is
possible. They have done so at the cost of continual controversy in
cities around the world where they have become popular. There are many
different controversies, but many have a common origin. We highlighted
the need for Sharing Economy companies to have a &amp;ldquo;zero marginal cost&amp;rdquo;
model, but that model relies on the company itself not having
significant new expenses for each service provider or each transaction.
And it has become clear that &amp;ldquo;zero marginal cost&amp;rdquo; is not a feature of
the technology alone, it also depends on the laws that govern the
company&amp;rsquo;s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing Economy companies present themselves in their terms and
conditions as a marketplace. Uber&amp;rsquo;s user agreement, for example, says
&amp;ldquo;Your ability to obtain transportation&amp;hellip; through the use of The
Services does not establish Uber as a provider of transportation,
logistics or delivery services or as a transportation carrier&amp;rdquo;. The
assertion is that the exchange itself, and anything that may go wrong
with it, is between the consumer and the service provider, not the
consumer and Uber. Other sharing economy companies present themselves in
the same way. Financially, this gets them off the hook for liability and
other problems, and they have relied on a particular American law to
sustain this position. Section 230 of the &amp;ldquo;Communications Decency Act&amp;rdquo;
includes this phrase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No provider&amp;hellip; of an interactive computer service shall be treated as
the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
information content provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sentences were written with web sites like YouTube in mind. The
hosting platform itself was protected from liability for the actions of
the users on the site. If someone uploads illegal videos to YouTube,
YouTube is at least partially protected from responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Section 230 to the Sharing Economy is still in dispute. The
European Court of Justice recently ruled that Uber may not qualify for
this kind of protection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service provided by Uber is more than an intermediation service&amp;hellip;
The ride-booking company must be classified as &amp;lsquo;a service in the field
of transport.&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 a London tribunal judge was even more direct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses
linked by a common &amp;lsquo;platform&amp;rsquo; is to our minds faintly ridiculous.
&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result will not be a simple outcome, as it depends on laws in
different jurisdictions and will vary from company to company. But the
impacts are huge: all kinds of disputes surrounding these companies
focus on their responsibility for some aspects of their business that
they are trying to avoid. Here is a brief list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are Uber drivers employees? Their flexibility suggests not, but that
is not the only criterion for employment: many jurisdictions also
weigh independence while on the job as a criterion, and Uber drivers
do not set their own prices, do not get to select riders, and have
many small controls over how they do their job. Many would say that
full-time Uber drivers, which is a large part of the overall
business, should qualify for many of the benefits that employees
get. This would add significantly to Uber&amp;rsquo;s costs, and present them
with even more financial problems. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Airbnb maintains that it is not responsible if its
hosts break the law or break their tenancy agreements in offering
their space for rent, but the company also makes it very difficult
for cities to go after hosts because Airbnb does not, in general,
share host information with the cities where it operates. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Again, the outcome of this dispute will have a real effect on
Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s cost structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brian Chesky was confident that his rating systems could solve
consumer protection problems, it has turned out that there are many
that ratings cannot address. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whether it is providing a usable
complaint system, ensuring vehicle safety, ensuring the safety of
Airbnb apartments, so far the Sharing Economy companies have avoided
many of the costs that other providers of commercial services have
to undertake. To the extent that they have to take on the cost of
things going wrong for consumers, the zero-marginal cost model will
vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As all the transactions on the platform go through the Internet,
both companies have set up shell structures so that they are routed
through subsidiaries in tax-friendly jurisdictions. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:29&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By not
paying into the tax base of the cities where they operate, the
companies are essentially parasitic on cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also many aspects of running cities that governments care
about, from road congestion to housing affordability, where there
have been continual disputes about the responsibility of the
platform companies. Airbnb has long promoted a vision of openness
and authenticity, promising that you could &amp;ldquo;live like a local&amp;rdquo;, but
in some of their biggest markets the locals have not been so happy
about it: Paris neighbourhoods have been losing population,
Barcelona has said &amp;ldquo;bring refugees, keep out tourists&amp;rdquo;. Managing
tourism effectively is a matter of balance, and cities are becoming
increasingly assertive in their dealings with Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson from all these disputes is that the business model of new
technology companies is not dictated solely by the technology itself, it
also reflects the responsibilities we expect companies &amp;ndash; particularly
large global companies &amp;ndash; to accept in order to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been interesting to watch cities become more assertive over time.
When Airbnb and Uber appeared on the scene full of brash promises, they
were intimidated by the challenge to get on board with the future or be
left behind, especially when the platforms could mobilize thousands of
happy customers and service providers to lobby on their behalf. But now
cities are realizing that some problems are shared, and that they have
choices beyond &amp;ldquo;take it or leave it&amp;rdquo;. Major tourist cities are now
regularly talking to each other about their successes and failures when
dealing with Airbnb, for example, and out of this is growing a new set
of rules that balance the interests of tourists with those of the
citizens in the places they visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &amp;ldquo;zero marginal cost&amp;rdquo; model is shaped by laws as much as by
technology, it raises the question of who builds the future? The debates
around the Sharing Economy mirror earlier debates that have grown around
technological innovation, from the industrial revolution on. Changes are
one part technological, and one part social, and getting the social
arrangements right is just as important for a healthy future as getting
the technology right. Those in the 19^th^ century who fought for child
labour protections or the forty hour working week or the vote were just
as much a part of building the future as the new industrialists and
inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same today. Technology will be a part of the changes that shape
the lives of our children, but so too will the legal and social changes
that surround them. So an understanding of history, of economics, of
society and what a good society needs is just as important as developing
a new twist on an artificial intelligence algorithm when it comes to
shaping the future. Educators in particular play an important role in
ensuring the next generation has the critical faculties and
understanding of society that is going to be needed to ensure they have
a healthy planet and a healthy relationship with our computational
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of transport and travel is not being made only by the
technology companies, it is being made in city government offices around
the world. It will be made not just by today&amp;rsquo;s computer science
students, but by our economics students and business students as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Airbnb Data Collection: Get the Data</title>
      <link>https://tomslee.github.io/publication/airbnb-get-the-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2017 16:46:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tomslee.github.io/publication/airbnb-get-the-data/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Each link downloads a zip file of the data for a named city or region. The zip file holds one or more csv files. Each csv file represents a single “survey” or “scrape” of the Airbnb web site for that city. The data is collected from the public Airbnb web site without logging in and the code I use is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tomslee/airbnb-data-collection&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the data provided for each listing. Please note that while other data can be collected from the site, and while other sites (especially the excellent Inside Airbnb) collect richer data about the host and the details of each listing, I have no plans to expand the scope at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;room_id: A unique number identifying an Airbnb listing. The listing has a URL on the Airbnb web site of &lt;a href=&#34;http://airbnb.com/rooms/room_id&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://airbnb.com/rooms/room_id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host_id: A unique number identifying an Airbnb host. The host’s page has a URL on the Airbnb web site of &lt;a href=&#34;http://airbnb.com/users/show/host_id&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://airbnb.com/users/show/host_id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;room_type: One of “Entire home/apt”, “Private room”, or “Shared room”
borough: A subregion of the city or search area for which the survey is carried out. The borough is taken from a shapefile of the city that is obtained independently of the Airbnb web site. For some cities, there is no borough information; for others the borough may be a number. If you have better shapefiles for a city of interest, please send them to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neighborhood: As with borough: a subregion of the city or search area for which the survey is carried out. For cities that have both, a neighbourhood is smaller than a borough. For some cities there is no neighbourhood information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reviews: The number of reviews that a listing has received. Airbnb has said that 70% of visits end up with a review, so the number of reviews can be used to estimate the number of visits. Note that such an estimate will not be reliable for an individual listing (especially as reviews occasionally vanish from the site), but over a city as a whole it should be a useful metric of traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overall_satisfaction: The average rating (out of five) that the listing has received from those visitors who left a review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accommodates: The number of guests a listing can accommodate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bedrooms: The number of bedrooms a listing offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price: The price (in $US) for a night stay. In early surveys, there may be some values that were recorded by month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minstay: The minimum stay for a visit, as posted by the host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latitude and longitude: The latitude and longitude of the listing as posted on the Airbnb site: this may be off by a few hundred metres. I do not have a way to track individual listing locations with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last_modified: the date and time that the values were read from the Airbnb web site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line of the CSV file holds the column headings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the cities, the survey dates, and a link to download each zip file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Markdown Reprinted from &lt;a href=&#34;http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/open-wide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The New Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In cities and on the Web, distinctive shared spaces attract private capital,
which erodes the very qualities that make them unique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of Linux and of Wikipedia, conflicting attitudes to
profit have co-existed with a commitment to digital sharing. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s
source code, text, artistic works, or government data, some see the open
digital commons as an ethical alternative to corporate production, while
others believe that sharing and profit go together like wine and cheese. And
now, as massively open online courses bring the rhetoric of digital openness
to education and Web-based startups are making it easy to share apartments and
cars and unused parking spaces and jobs, the seeds have been planted for a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059521%5F2059717%5F2059710,00.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sharing economy&lt;/a&gt; whose flowering is welcomed both by idealists who value
authenticity, sustainability and community sharing over commodity ownership
and by venture capitalists looking to make their next fortune. Strange
bedfellows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities have long been sites of commons and commerce: full of trade and private
enterprise but shaped by parks and streetscapes, neighborhoods and rhythms of
daily life that grow from non-commodified sharing. In his 2012 book &lt;em&gt;Rebel
Cities&lt;/em&gt;, David Harvey observes how, in cities, &amp;ldquo;people of all sorts and classes
mingle &amp;hellip; to produce a common of perpetually changing and transitory life,&amp;rdquo;
from the irrepressible energy of Manhattan to the café culture of Rome to
Barcelona&amp;rsquo;s distinctive architecture to the symbolic meaning of modern Berlin.
Yes, by 2009, volunteers had spent &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive%5FSurplus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a hundred million hours&lt;/a&gt; building Wikipedia,
but cities put this dramatic number into perspective: Every year the citizens
of Canada alone volunteer &lt;a href=&#34;http://volunteer.ca/content/about-us&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;roughly 20 Wikipedias&lt;/a&gt; for hospitals and children&amp;rsquo;s
sports, for charities and the arts &amp;mdash; the equivalent of more than a million
full-time jobs in a population of 30 million &amp;mdash; and there is no reason to
believe that the count is complete or that Canada is exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similarities between urban and digital worlds are not incidental. Both are
cultural spaces, and cultural spaces have always been iceberg-like. Above the
surface, market forces and state interventions; beneath, a mass of
noncommercial activity organized, at least in part, as open commons. But while
digital entrepreneurs look to the &amp;ldquo;Internet&amp;rsquo;s way of working&amp;rdquo; to disrupt the
bricks and mortar of our cities, urban experiences have sober lessons for the
digerati if they will listen: The relationship between commons and commerce is
fraught with contradictions. Harvey never once mentions computer technology in
his book, but his reflections on cities make a compelling case that
money-making and sharing are far from natural allies, and that the role of
openness must be questioned if commons-based production is to be a real
alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economics of culture are those of monopolistic competition. Each and every
cultural work is a unique creation and, like other unique goods, they offers
the prospect of &amp;ldquo;monopoly rents&amp;rdquo; for any who can corner the market on that
work. Open commons are themselves cultural works, and while the tending of
commons is collective and non-commodified by definition, the commons itself is
a magnet for private capital. As Harvey points out, &amp;ldquo;the common, even &amp;mdash; and
particularly &amp;mdash; when it cannot be enclosed, can always be traded upon &amp;hellip; the
ambience and attractiveness of a city &amp;hellip; is a collective product of its
citizens [but] it is the tourist trade that commercially capitalizes upon that
common.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a non-commercial common attracts commercial capital, but is this a problem?
After all, open commons are not scarce resources, prone to depletion like
clean water or ocean fish stocks. Your enjoyment of a city park or a
downloaded song does not hinder me from enjoying the same. What turns the
contradiction into a tragedy is that private capital tends to destroy the
qualities that attracted it in the first place. While commons and commerce can
never be completely disentangled, it is large-scale capital that is most
damaging, and it is the commitment to openness that blocks off ways to prevent
the damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private capital damages open commons through three mechanisms. It erodes the
common, it alienates the community that tends the common, and distorts the
essential nature of the common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighborhood diversity is an open commons prone to erosion. Harvey writes: &amp;ldquo;A
community group that struggles to maintain ethnic diversity in its
neighborhood and protect against gentrification may suddenly find its property
prices (and taxes) rising as real estate agents market the ‘character&amp;rsquo; of
their neighborhood to the wealthy as multicultural, street-lively, and
diverse. By the time the market has done its destructive work, not only have
the original residents been dispossessed of that common which they had created
(often being forced out by rising rents and property taxes), but the common
itself becomes so debased as to be unrecognizable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital homogenizes even as it demands uniqueness. For a global tourist
industry to profit from a city&amp;rsquo;s special qualities it must fit that city into
its worldwide operations. Hotel chains build standardized hotels, charter
companies demand standardized airports, marketing departments seek messages
that resonate around the world. The more distinct a city&amp;rsquo;s culture, the more
pressure to squeeze it into the homogenizing templates of global tourism and
global trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the digital world, sharing-economy sites such as Yelp or TripAdvisor are
built on reputation systems, which are digital commons prone to erosion. The
value of these systems is their trustworthiness, so the work of tending them
must be non-commercial: payments for ratings automatically tarnish the
integrity of the system. But once the reputation commons has become
sufficiently valuable, the temptation for hotel owners, visitors, and others
to game the system for private gain becomes significant. A restaurant rating
placed by a competitor restaurant is not easily identified, and so disputes
proliferate as reputation systems become more widely used. It is up to the
site owners to handle the erosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the approach of some &amp;ldquo;sharing economy&amp;rdquo; companies is to ignore the
problem. TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2010/06/tripadvisor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the issue of reputation
gaming, saying, &amp;ldquo;One or two phony reviews: who gives a shit?&amp;rdquo; Brian Chesky of
apartment rental service AirBnB &lt;a href=&#34;http://skift.com/2013/01/11/airbnb-responds-to-illegal-rentals-story-first-of-all-its-not-illegal-everywhere/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that when it comes to screening
apartments, &amp;ldquo;It turns out that cities can&amp;rsquo;t screen as well as technologies can
screen. Companies have these magical things called reputation systems.&amp;rdquo; But
reputation systems are not magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of occasional bad reviews is not immediately obvious and varies
from context to context. A few bad outcomes completely break some regimes
(there is a reason the supply of heart surgeons is not governed by open
recommendation systems); for others, such as the entries in Wikipedia,
scattered inaccuracies are less important. Accommodation sites have had their
share of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/08/airbnb-becoming-known-property-damage-meth-and-zero-security/40655/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/5934731/prostitutes-turn-airbnb-apartment-into-brothel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;misuse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1205794/Rape-horror-tourist-used-couchsurfing-website-aimed-travellers.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt;, but Chesky and Kaufer emphasize the large
number of successful transactions on their systems, gauging their success by
the average user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But incumbent licensing regimes, so disparaged by sharing-economy advocates,
are evaluated differently and with good reason. The severe consequences of
extreme incidents lead, over time, to demands for rules that are stricter than
crowd-based ratings. The value of the system is determined not by the average
but by the worst possible user experience. So far, there is no sign that
sharing-economy sites are taking serious measures to treat the rare calamities
with the central importance they deserve: The commercial incentives of
sharing-economy entrepreneurs make them bad stewards of the reputation-system
commons on which they rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey writes that, in co-opting the uniqueness of an open common, capital
&amp;ldquo;produces widespread alienation and resentment among the cultural producers
who experience first-hand the appropriation and exploitation of their
creativity and their political commitments to the benefits of others.&amp;rdquo; Many
digital commoners have experienced such an alienation moment, a realization
that the common they thought they were tending is, in reality, a private
estate, made green and fertile with voluntary labor and then sold lock, stock,
and barrel to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woody Guthrie wrote one of the great commons songs: &amp;ldquo;This Land Is Your Land.&amp;rdquo;
After Guthrie&amp;rsquo;s death, his daughter Nora entrusted piles of his previously
unheard lyrics to radical musician Billy Bragg, who put them to music and
turned them into a pair of successful albums in the 1990s. When entrepreneur
Michael Birch was putting together social network Bebo.com in 2006, he reached
out to Bragg, who &amp;mdash; frustrated by the music industry&amp;rsquo;s treatment of
musicians &amp;mdash; gave him advice on how to build an &amp;ldquo;artist-centered
environment.&amp;rdquo; But the two &amp;ldquo;ignored the elephant in the room: the issue of
whether he ought to consider paying some kind of royalties to the artists.&amp;rdquo;
Bebo was to be a common after all, and the tending of commons must be done in
a sharing, non-commodified way. In 2008, Birch sold Bebo.com to AOL, pocketing
an estimated $600 million. The sale led Bragg to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22bragg.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;if young
musicians are to have a chance of enjoying a fruitful career, then we need to
establish the principle of artists&amp;rsquo; rights throughout the Internet &amp;mdash; and we
need to do it now.&amp;rdquo; This site, it turns out, is not your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole online communities have experienced their own similar alienation
moments. Goodreads, a social space for book lovers, was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sold to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;,
triggering an angry backlash among members whose voluntary contributions built
much of the site&amp;rsquo;s value. Academic reference manager Mendeley, which long
employed a rhetoric of openness, alienated its user base by &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/04/08/a-matter-of-perspective-elsevier-acquires-mendeley-or-mendeley-sells-itself-to-elsevier/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;selling itself&lt;/a&gt; to
Elsevier, a company with a reputation for resisting open-access publication at
every turn. Undeterred, Mendeley still pronounces that its &amp;ldquo;real power lies in
what it does with the collective data from users.&amp;rdquo; Tumblr&amp;rsquo;s owner David Karp
may not be &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnbc.com/id/100751632&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;about the money&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; and the owners of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zipcar.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zipcar&lt;/a&gt; may believe that their
company is &amp;ldquo;about the people who make it a reality: a team that works hard,
members who believe, and organizations that are making conscious decisions for
the future.&amp;rdquo; Nonetheless, they didn&amp;rsquo;t mind selling out to Yahoo and Avis,
respectively, and alienating their commoners when the price was right. Early
collaborative sites like IMDB (another property of Amazon) and CDDB (now owned
by Sony Corporation) also turned out to be not commons but private estates,
tended by sharecroppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techno-optimists tend to credit technology alone for fostering digital commons
and downplay the nontechnical work of many commoners. In his book Cognitive
Surplus, Clay Shirky highlighted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.couchsurfing.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Couchsurfing&lt;/a&gt;, a site where young global
travelers can arrange to visit and host each other, as a healthy digital
commons. Couchsurfing started life as couchsurfing.org, not couchsurfing.com;
even the code that ran the site was provided by the Couchsurfers themselves.
But the site did have owners, and in August 2011, they &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/09/couchsurfing-corporation-bona-fide-bogus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;incorporated&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crunchbase.com/company/couchsurfing-international&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt; $7.6 million in venture funding. As the company&amp;rsquo;s market value has
grown, the Couchsurfing community has deteriorated. A long-time Couchsurfer
&lt;a href=&#34;http://nithincoca.com/2013/03/27/the-rise-and-fall-of-couchsurfing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;laments&lt;/a&gt; the days of &amp;ldquo;art gatherings, bonfires, a weekly meet up at a bar, café
gatherings, potlucks,&amp;rdquo; now lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community&amp;rsquo;s former strength turned out to have little to do with
technology. As a commenter at Quora &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quora.com/CouchSurfing/What-is-happening-to-Couchsurfing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Couchsurfing thrived with a very haphazard and underfunded management
structure precisely because local volunteers around the world believed they
were part of a cause bigger than profit. Local collectives were highly tied to
their local communities &amp;hellip; The technical architecture of the new systems is
much better, but paradoxically the ‘professional&amp;rsquo; product development process
fixes things that were broken on purpose. In other words, Couchsurfing evolved
around certain quirks and inefficient processes that actually became critical
to the health of the social trust platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 5000 Couchsurfing members have joined the forum &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=45507&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;We are Against CS
becoming a for-profit corporation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast Couchsurfing with Hostelling International, a venerable network of
national youth hostelling organizations that has remained resolutely
nonprofit. Over 100 years old, it is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hihostels.com/pdf/HistoryPhilosophy.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;still going strong&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;ldquo;currently
provides 35 million overnight stays a year through more than 4,000 hostels in
over 80 countries.&amp;rdquo; Some people do support themselves through the commons of
hostels &amp;mdash; some work in the hosteling organizations, others are paid to run
hostels themselves &amp;mdash; but it&amp;rsquo;s orders of magnitude away from the sudden
injection of millions of venture-capital dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As capital is attracted to a successful common, so the nature of the common
itself becomes a matter for dispute. In his analysis of cities, Harvey turns
again to conflict between the tourist industry and residents over the shared
meaning of an urban space: &amp;ldquo;The initial erasure of all mention of the slave
trade in the reconstruction of Albert Dock in Liverpool generated protests on
the part of the excluded population of Caribbean background.&amp;rdquo; Similarly, after
reunification, Berliners were caught between the frying pan of a globalized
aesthetic (the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://habitusmag.com/2011/08/3841/the-disneyfication-of-the-berlin-wall/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Disneyfication of the Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;) and the fire of a
&amp;ldquo;parochial nationalism,&amp;rdquo; with the potential for &amp;ldquo;a virulent rejection of
foreigners and immigrants.&amp;rdquo; Capital, Harvey argues, wades into the culture
wars to pursue the monopoly rents at stake in commons, making &amp;ldquo;interventions
in the field of culture, history, heritage, aesthetics, and meanings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital commons are subject to similar distortions. The nature of Linux, which
famously started as an amateur hobby project, has been changed by the private
capital it attracted. Independent contributors now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/17/state%5Fof%5Flinux%5F2013/make&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; fewer than 12% of the
changes to the kernel; the bulk of the changes come from developers employed
in the hundreds of corporations that build businesses on the Linux commons. In
an &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/yVpbFMhOAwE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;introductory video&lt;/a&gt;, the Linux Foundation explicitly acknowledges the
corporatization of the effort, explaining that Linux is &amp;ldquo;built
collaboratively, across companies, geographies, and markets.&amp;rdquo; Reflecting this
shift, the operating system is no longer primarily for individual users who
wish to control their computing environment. Instead, its major uses are in
consumer electronics products (including phones), enterprise data centers,
financial trading systems, and the massive data centers of the Web 2.0 giants
such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Once a challenger to capitalist modes of
production, Linux is now an integral part of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So capital erodes, alienates, and distorts efforts to build value on
non-commodified sharing, and openness demands that capital is given unfettered
access to the commons. Are digital commons and urban commons doomed to feed
the hand that bites them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not. Among all the contradictions of the commons, Harvey identifies
one that provides grounds for hope. The search for monopoly rents on commons
&amp;ldquo;leads global capital to value local initiatives &amp;mdash; indeed, in certain
respects, the more distinctive and, in these times, the more transgressive the
initiative, the better &amp;hellip; It can even support (though cautiously and often
nervously) transgressive cultural practices because this is one way in which
to be original, creative, and authentic, as well as unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital cannot afford to eliminate the uniqueness of a particular commons
entirely. Harvey argues that this contradiction provides an opportunity for
radical movements to build around urban commons, that the urban commons can
still be &amp;ldquo;spaces of hope for the construction of &amp;hellip; a vibrant
anti-commodification politics: one in which the progressive forces of cultural
production and transformation can seek to appropriate and undermine the forces
of capital rather than the other way round.&amp;rdquo; Some would see the eruption of
protest in Turkey, sparked by the redevelopment of a park near Istanbul&amp;rsquo;s
Taksim Square, as an example of such politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the digital world, limiting openness is one way to restrict the
encroachment of capital and to maintain digital commons as alternative spaces.
Like urban commons, digital commons can be spaces of hope, but only if the
contradictory relationship between commons and commerce is acknowledged and
addressed, if the destructive influence of capital can be limited, and if some
of the accepted wisdom around digital commons is challenged &amp;mdash; including the
unquestioning acceptance of &amp;ldquo;openness&amp;rdquo; as a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
