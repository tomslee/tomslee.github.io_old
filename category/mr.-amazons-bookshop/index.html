After the excitement and confusion of Kylie and Edmund&rsquo;s investigation, evening found me tired and emotional. My head was spinning with all the numbers they had collected and what Kylie seemed to make of them.

I could hardly believe my bleary eyes when I entered the stable the next day &ndash; young Edmund was there already, sitting at the trestle table next to the differ controls, with my private notebook open in front of him! He may smudge it with his grubby gardener fingers, or drip his slimy gardener snot over my pages! I swatted him across the back of the hands with my switch (I always carry a switch).

As the heat of July dried the horse droppings on the road into that agreeably dusty texture they gain in late summer, I received the final piece I needed to repair my differ. I immediately grabbed Edmund again and headed out to the stable.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this all about Mr. Whimsley?&rdquo; asked the idiot child.

Edmund, the gardener&rsquo;s son, has the look of a runt about him: he is undersized, has a perpetually dripping nose and a habit of scratching his backside. He is looked down on by the Whimsley village children, which is an achievement in itself: he positively broadcasts stupidity. On the other hand, his is obedient and hardworking, which are important qualities in the servant classes, and has a strong pair of arms so I decided to let him assist me with my investigation.

I rocketed over to my stables at the crack of noon and cleaned up the old difference engine, or differ as we enthusiasts call it. My friend Mr. Babbage, you will recall, had told me that Mr. Amazon had a new trick - instead of going to Mr. Amazon&rsquo;s Bookshop, one could use a difference engine to ask him as many questions as you like.

          [This is the fifth instalment of Mr. Amazon&rsquo;s Bookshop. A list of all instalments is here; the previous instalment is here. This instalment was written over the Christmas holiday, well before Belkingate.]
My inability to understand how Amazon worked was the first step in an increasingly tormented relationship with the shop and its owner during the last few months. Two other events pushed me from by early enthusiasm with the peculiar place to a more antagonistic stance.
First, one of the other bookstores in town closed down.

The next day I woke early, Google&rsquo;s suggestion that Mr. Amazon&rsquo;s Bookshop was founded on an illusion still hammering in my head. I decided that this puzzle needed to be solved and, unlike so many ideas that come on the threshold of sleep, my notion from the previous evening still seemed like a filly with legs. After breakfasting on the usual kippers, tea, and toast with ginger marmalade, I dressed and rushed into the village.

No matter how often I went back to Mr. Amazon&rsquo;s shop, I never could understand its workings. I often hinted to the man behind the desk that I would like to know, but he ignored me. I even asked him once in a direct and semi-serious manner: &ldquo;what do you have down there behind that desk Amazon? How do you get these books? Is it mole-people, Amazon?
