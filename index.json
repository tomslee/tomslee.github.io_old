[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Researchers from Harvard and MIT warn us about \u0026ldquo;Adversarial attacks on medical machine learning\u0026rdquo;, in which \u0026ldquo;a small, carefully designed change in how inputs are presented to a system\u0026hellip; completely alter its output, causing it to arrive at manifestly wrong conclusions.\u0026rdquo; (Link) I think that\u0026rsquo;s only half the story\u0026hellip;\n\n Table of Contents  Adversarial attacks and workarounds in medical machine learning Workarounds   \nAdversarial attacks and workarounds in medical machine learning It\u0026rsquo;s not like the Harvard/MIT article is purely about adversarial attacks. Early on the authors point out that the American medical claims approval process is plagued by many competing financial interests, \u0026ldquo;providers [i.e. doctors and hospitals] seeking to maximize and payers [insurance companies] seeking to minimize reinbursement.\u0026rdquo;\nBut the remainder of the paper focuses almost exclusively on the problem of adversarial attacks by healthcare providers. Deep learning algorithms may be uncannily accurate over a well-defined data set, but they are also fragile if a sample steps in an unexpected direction, and this fragility leaves them open to \u0026ldquo;attack\u0026rdquo;. Most blatantly, the authors show, doctors could modify medical images to change the diagnosis, even as the image appears unchanged to the human eye. Then there are grey areas, like rotations of an image, or a careful choice of words in notes, that pushes the system to give unexpected results. How should the medical system handle a techique that seems so accurate and yet so easily misled?\nWorkarounds Adversarial attacks are \u0026ldquo;inputs to a machine learning model that are intentionally crafted to force the model to make a mistake\u0026rdquo;: that is, you take an input that the model classifies correctly and you tweak it so that it is classified incorrectly. Workarounds are the opposite of adversarial attacks: inputs that are intentionally crafted to force the model to correct a mistake. That is, you take an input that is incorrectly classified by the model and tweak it so that it is correctly classified.\nEven the best machine learning systems are, after all, statistical engines with non-zero error rates, so incorrectly classified examples will always be with us. And of course in the real world there are ambiguities in any data set, to the boundaries between classes are not as sharp as a labelled training set may make it seem.\nAdversarial examples may be novel, but in the automated workplace workarounds have become routine, even if they are often overlooked. Automated systems shift decision-making from \u0026ldquo;front line\u0026rdquo; workers to a system, but as these systems have entered the workplace, many professionals have learned a new and often unacknowledged skill: they have become experts at making the system work properly.\n  Figure 1: Schematic view of a machine learning model. The data points are shown with their \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; values of blue or orange, and the background shade marks the areas that the model categorizes as \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;orange\u0026rdquo;. The adversarial example changes a correctly-classified \u0026ldquo;orange\u0026rdquo; data point into an incorrectly-classified one, while the workaround changes an incorrectly-classified data point into a correctly classified one. The image was built from Tensorflow Playground)   As just one example, legal scholar Jennifer Raso explored the changing jobs of Ontario case workers when a new automated decision system was introduced. Instead of making their own judgements about client needs, case workers are now to enter data into the system, which would make a decision according to well-defined rules. She writes about how the social service case workers responded:\n#+begin_kquote While new technologies may attempt to deskill and decentre front-line decision-makers, transforming them into data entry clerks, caseworkers learn how to expertly translate and input client data to produce decisions that more closely match their interpretation of clients’ needs and welfare laws. #+end_quote\nThe idea will be familiar to anyone who has read James C. Scott\u0026rsquo;s Seeing Like a State: certain schemes to improve the human condition assume, and impose, a simplified and idealized way of working and living that neglects the unruly irregularities of real life. Managed systems commonly rely on a certain level of workaround to even function: hence the effectiveness of the \u0026ldquo;work to rule\u0026rdquo; as a form of protest.\nAmerican healthcare systems have their own workarounds. The rigidities of automated billing systems recently produced a memorable essay by Atul Gawande entitled Why Doctors Hate Their Computers, documenting many of the challenges experienced by physicians as new decision support systems have been introduced.\nI said that adversarial attacks and workarounds are opposites, but in another way they are very similar. Surprisingly there is no way to distinguish unambiguously between an adversarial attack and a workaround in real-world environments within machine learning theory. Attempts to define \u0026ldquo;attacks\u0026rdquo; refer to \u0026ldquo;intent\u0026rdquo;, but who is to say what that is? Many examples focus on cases where \u0026ldquo;ground truth\u0026rdquo; is unambiguous (a picture of a bus is \u0026ldquo;obviously\u0026rdquo; not a picture of a monkey). Examples that are clearly artificial and intentional are reflections of lab research, not of how systems will play out in the wild. Some machine learning practitioners have gone so far as to define \u0026ldquo;attacks\u0026rdquo; as any attempt by a subject to influence the outcome of a machine learning system, which makes an attacker of anyone who has put effort into writing their resume in the hopes of getting a job. But don\u0026rsquo;t take all this from me: if you want to hear an expert opinion on this definition problem, see this talk by David Evans.\nWhen it comes down to it, both adversarial examples and workarounds are deliberate changes to inputs in order to generate desired outputs. Machine learning systems are statistical, and however accurate they may be over a large data set, statistics will not say whether any one individual answer is correct. For complex tasks such as medical diagnosis certified \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answers are often not available. And if the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answer is not well-defined, who is to say whether an intentional change is correcting a mistake or corrupting a correct answer?\nWill workarounds be needed for the next generation of deep learning medical systems? We can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure yet, but history suggests that they will. There is a long history of technical innovations that are designed around idealized and simplified models of behaviour, and which underestimate the complexities of \u0026ldquo;edge cases\u0026rdquo; in real life. Witness the over-enthusiasm around self-driving cars a couple of years ago, that is now being confronted with the messiness of reality.\nThe article is not completely silent on the topic of workaroudns: it does reference a paper from almost 20 years ago titled \u0026ldquo;Physician Manipulation of Reimbursement Rules for Patients: Between a Rock and a Hard Place\u0026rdquo;, which says this:\n It has been suggested that some insurers are \u0026ldquo;gaming\u0026rdquo; patients and physicians\u0026mdash;tricking them into paying for covered services by routinely denying coverage but then approving services that are subsequently appealed, knowing that time and other constraints will prevent some appeals.\n So doctor workarounds may be responses not only to technical deficiencies in the system, but also to real or perceived bad faith on the part of the insurers (or their suppliers) who are responsible for the system itself. And why should doctors have faith in these systems? Big money is at work on both sides, and the incentives for insurance companies to \u0026ldquo;optimize\u0026rdquo; is at least as strong as for the doctors. They face incentives to fix inaccuracies that lead to overbilling, but not those blind spots that lead to underpayments; to label edge cases in training sets in such a way as to minimize payments; to redefine payment schedules around the observed behaviour of the systems.\nWhen it comes to interventions, Finlayson et al make two recommendations. The first is to procrastinate: to avoid stifling innovation by prematurely enforcing demands for robustness. The second is to increase supervision of medical practitioners, to check that they do not \u0026ldquo;tamper\u0026rdquo; with the data. Such an approach not only neglects any consideration of insurance companies, but it also rules out workarounds. It removes any room for doctors\u0026rsquo; discretion and judgement, and reduces the role of physician to that of a managed and supervised data entry technician.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve written elsewhere, most machine learning systems of any interest are incentive incompatible. The subjects who provide the inputs and the consumers of the outputs have different and conflicting interests. And in such an arrangement additional rules are not just likely, but inevitable. The problem with procrastination is that it favours the consumers and, more than anyone, the providers of the system. A natural response to problems is to demand more complete data, better data, and closer supervision of data entry. Without a check on insurance companies, medical machine learning systems will not be a cure for a damaged health system.\n","date":1564778406,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564779390,"objectID":"7fd72169f2acab9072d9ab8331928a6f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/publication/workaround-medical/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/workaround-medical/","section":"publication","summary":"Researchers from Harvard and MIT warn us about \u0026ldquo;Adversarial attacks on medical machine learning\u0026rdquo;, in which \u0026ldquo;a small, carefully designed change in how inputs are presented to a system\u0026hellip; completely alter its output, causing it to arrive at manifestly wrong conclusions.\u0026rdquo; (Link) I think that\u0026rsquo;s only half the story\u0026hellip;\n\n Table of Contents  Adversarial attacks and workarounds in medical machine learning Workarounds   \nAdversarial attacks and workarounds in medical machine learning It\u0026rsquo;s not like the Harvard/MIT article is purely about adversarial attacks.","tags":null,"title":"Workarounds in decision support systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Books  No One Makes you Shop at Wal Mart (link), Between the Lines Press (2006) What\u0026rsquo;s Yours is Mine: Against the Sharing Economy (2015).

In that time we have seen claims that this is a new model of employment, even that it is the future of work, and that it is fundamentally changing the cities in which we live. But in recent years we\u0026rsquo;ve also seen signs of a bubble. A few years ago the story of the Sharing Economy would have been simple: here is a new model, and some people like it and some do not, but it works. Now there is more scepticism, and the phrase itself may be fading from public discourse.\nThis essay gives a quick tour of the sharing economy, from its beginnings after the 2008 financial crash to today. I will walk through some of the business models and some of the economics of this sector, and sketch some of the controversies. There is another theme to the essay, which is \u0026ldquo;who makes the future?\u0026rdquo; Is the world of work, for example, built by technology companies in Silicon Valley, or can the rest of the world have a say as well.\n2008: Beginnings Let\u0026rsquo;s look at three companies which each started just about ten years ago and which had a similar business model in common, even though the people involved did not know each other at all. There was no name for it at the time, but there was something in the air\u0026hellip;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with Airbnb, which you will probably know is the controversial short-term rental or holiday accommodation company, where people rent out residential homes for use by tourists and other visitors.\nIn 2007, newly graduated design students Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were looking for ways to make their end-of-month rental payments in San Francisco when an industry conference came to town. They bought some inflatable airbeds and offered accommodations to attendees looking for a cheap place to stay. They were inundated with requests and realized there may be a market for this kind of thing, and so \u0026ldquo;Airbed \u0026amp; Breakfast\u0026rdquo; was born. 1\nSince then, the story has been one of hard work and growth. Running up the limit on multiple credit cards to finance the very beginnings, they got an early investment from Paul Graham\u0026rsquo;s Y-Combinator fund. Struggling to get the site to take off, they went out to their biggest city (New York) and got the hosts to have professional photos taken of their rooms to make them more appealing; the bookings increased, and professional photography continues to be the most effective way for a host to attract guests. Other maneuvers included a breakfast-cereal pitch around the Democratic convention in Chicago and a widely criticized email campaign via Craigslist.\nAfter the early tribulations, the now-trio of Chesky, Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk found themselves at the head of a phenomenon. In 2011 Airbnb had 50,000 listings; in 2012 that number more than doubled to 120,000; by the end of 2013 it was 550,000; in 2018 it is nearly 5 million listings. 2 For comparison, the largest hotel company in the world by number of rooms is the InterContinental Group with 775,000 rooms. 3\nJust as Airbnb was getting started, two entrepreneurs were attending a conference in Paris, and had a hard time finding a cab. These two were Travis Kalanick, who was to go on to be the controversial CEO of Uber, and Garrett Camp. They didn\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about paying rent, as both were already rich from earlier technology ventures. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be great, they thought, if you could get a cab just by pressing a button on the newly released iPhone.\nIn its early days, Uber worked with limo companies to provide drivers, but then they realized that a competitor named Lyft was using amateur drivers rather than professionals, and Uber did not want to be left out. So they set up Uber X, which is Uber Pop in most of Europe, and opened up their business to independent drivers.\nUber\u0026rsquo;s growth has been even more dramatic than that of Airbnb. The company has raised investment money like no other, raising tens of billions of dollars in investment.\nOur third example is less well known now, but it was often talked about as another archetype of the Sharing Economy. Here is how the company\u0026rsquo;s web site described the founding story.\nIt was a cold night in Boston in February of 2008 when Leah Busque realized she was out of dog food for her 100-lb yellow lab, Kobe. Leah thought to herself, \u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice if there was a place online I could go to connect with my neighbors\u0026mdash;maybe one who was already at the store at that very moment\u0026mdash;who could help me out?\u0026rdquo;\nFrom this experience, TaskRabbit (formerly RUNmyERRAND), an online and mobile marketplace that connects neighbors to get things done, was born \u0026hellip; Neighbors helping neighbors\u0026mdash;it\u0026rsquo;s an old school concept reimagined for today. 4\nOne of the typical tasks that people helped with was assembling Ikea furniture. TaskRabbit had early successes and attracted a lot of attention, but in the end it did not become the kind of global company that Airbnb and Uber have become. Instead, after several years as an independent company, it sold itself to Ikea.\nMost people\u0026rsquo;s problems don\u0026rsquo;t turn into multi-billion dollar companies. Timing --- whether by luck or by skill \u0026ndash; was essential to their success. Here is a set of things that had been put in place in the few years before 2008, each of which was needed for Airbnb and Uber to take off:\n Broad-band internet. Many homes had computers, and many people were increasingly comfortable with the Internet as a part of their daily lives.\n Online payments. People were also getting used to using credit cards on the Internet to pay for their purchases at Amazon, eBay, Expedia and other early successes.\n Mobile computing. Beyond that, we were entering the era of the smartphone. The iPhone was released in 2007 and Uber, for one, could not have been invented before the iPhone.\n Social media. In the early years, pseudonyms and anonymity were the norm on the Internet. As the famous cartoon caption went: \u0026ldquo;On the Internet, nobody knows you\u0026rsquo;re a dog\u0026rdquo;. But starting with Facebook in 2006, many people were getting used to the idea of using real names. TaskRabbit and Uber\u0026rsquo;s competitor Lyft both hooked into Facebook\u0026rsquo;s user identification system as a part of their business model, and Airbnb and others used Facebook accounts as proof of identity.\n Rating systems. The use of ratings, particularly for Netflix movies and Amazon books, but also through sites such as Yelp and Travelocity, had spread and the five-star rating that is now ubiquitous was becoming common.\n Cloud computing. Starting in 2006 Amazon started renting out computer usage from its own massive data centres at bargain prices, starting the era of cloud computing. This meant that new companies could start up without buying expensive hardware: they could use Amazon for their computing needs and get started much more cheaply.\n Crowdsourcing. The basic computing architecture of the Sharing Economy is the \u0026ldquo;platform\u0026rdquo; where the company itself runs the software, but those who provide the content come from outside. The success of Wikipedia showed this could be done, and eBay showed you could build a valuable company that way. YouTube was and continues to be a remarkable example of this crowdsourced structure.\n  Even though these were all present, the Sharing Economy brought with it the shock of the new --- pressing a button on your phone and seeing a car appear seemed like magic, and booking to stay in somebody\u0026rsquo;s house half way around the world opened up new possibilities for travel. The novelty of the experiences gave the new services an aura of cool, and many people immediately thought: this is the future.\n2010 \u0026ndash; 2015: Rise Airbnb and Uber were not founded as Sharing Economy companies, because the name did not exist. In the years 2010 to 2012 a set of other companies were founded using a similar business model and commentators looked for names to describe this trend. \u0026ldquo;Collaborative economy\u0026rdquo;^1^, \u0026ldquo;circular economy\u0026rdquo;, 5 and \u0026ldquo;the mesh\u0026rdquo;6 were all put forward, but in the end the Sharing Economy won.\nIf there is a one-sentence description of the Sharing Economy, it may be Internet platforms for real-world services. The first few years of the century had seen internet platforms for retail (Amazon and eBay), for social media exchanges and advertising (Google and Facebook), and for media (Netflix, Apple, YouTube). Of particular interest were eBay and YouTube: crowdsourced platforms where the content seemed to appear by magic. The Sharing Economy takes this model, but instead of uploading videos the platform is used for people who provide real-world services.\nHow far can crowdsourced Internet platforms go? Can their economic benefits be applied to the service economy too? That\u0026rsquo;s what the Sharing Economy phenomenon asks us.\nA 2017 report for the World Economic Forum gives a three-point definition.7 First is \u0026ldquo;The use of digital technologies to match buyers and sellers,\u0026rdquo; which is similar to the point above. But they add two other components. One is \u0026ldquo;Capitalizing on idle capacity\u0026rdquo;: the service providers are generally offering something they already own, but which they are not using right now. So the service providers are not employees of the platform owners, they are independent actors who are making use of their own assets. To go back to our three stories: perhaps they have a car, and can drive for Uber; perhaps they have some spare time and can run some errands for TaskRabbit; perhaps they have a spare room and can put it on Airbnb. The other additional point is \u0026ldquo;trust verification\u0026rdquo;, to which I\u0026rsquo;ll return.\nWith this framework, let\u0026rsquo;s look at some examples of companies that started up in those years of 2010 to 2012. This was the era when seemingly a million start-up plans were pitched as the \u0026ldquo;Uber for this\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Airbnb for that\u0026rdquo;. But I want to start with something that is the opposite. The Toronto Tool Library8 is a non-profit organization that lets people rent tools for home projects. The organization is geographically limited and community focused: it has no plans to drive major stores out of business or to become a global behemoth. But it matters to the story of the Sharing Economy because it draws on one of the early images that promoted the idea, which is the story of the power drill.9 Many of us have a hand drill that sits on a shelf and is hardly ever used and Rachel Botsman, who was one of the early promoters of the Sharing Economy and helped to articulate it as a new development, says: we don\u0026rsquo;t really want a drill, what we want is the hole it makes. So why not share a drill instead of owning it? Sharing is sustainable, it helps us get off the consumerist track of ownership, weighed down by our goods. The drill was the embodiment of using \u0026ldquo;idle capacity\u0026rdquo;. It has an appealing sustainability angle to it and also hints to a concept called \u0026ldquo;access over ownership\u0026rdquo;: we don\u0026rsquo;t have to buy in to the bourgeois and consumerist culture of ownership, we can tread more lightly on the earth by dipping in and out of these sharing arrangements instead. It was a catchy and attractive image.\nIn 2013 Airbnb was already taking off, and a natural extension of that idea was to share meals. Airbnb said \u0026ldquo;you don\u0026rsquo;t need hotels, you just need a platform where you can connect with other people.\u0026rdquo; Cookening, Feastly and other sites applied the same logic to restaurants. If you are travelling to a new city, why not eat like a local in their own house? Again, the appeal here is to authenticity, to personal connection rather than institutions and companies, and to the unusual combination of small and big that crowdsourcing requires: many small individual exchanges building a global platform.\nTools and meals are fairly low risk, banged thumbs and food poisoning aside, but finance is surely something different. Remember that we are talking about a period right after the financial crisis, when personal finances were stretched and banks were viewed with suspicion. So companies like Lending Club took a lead from charities such as Kiva, which focused on direct person-to-person donations, as well as from initiatives like the Grameen bank, which used social lending to pioneer the idea of microfinance, and whose founder Mohammed Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. The idea behind peer-to-peer lending was that individuals could lend to each other, combining social purpose and sound investment.\nHere the question of trust is at its most severe. What happens if I take a loan from you and don\u0026rsquo;t pay it back? How do you assess credit? The early players in this industry like Lending Club and Prosper were experimenting with a variety of approaches, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that worked out later on.\nAnd to finish, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to household services like TaskRabbit. A lot of companies started in this area. One is Homejoy, which was Google\u0026rsquo;s venture into housecleaning \u0026ndash; an eyebrow-raising idea in itself. Another was Handy, which looked to broaden from cleaning to other services like plumbing and carpentry.\nAnd there were lots of others. A short list would include DogVacay, which was often written about to show the quirky and personal aspect of the market. Instacart and Deliveroo highlighted the food delivery area, which is still going strong. BlaBlaCar is a French service for taking rides from city to city. ZipCar was important as one of the first carsharing companies, and it preceded most of the others here.\nIn 2013 to 2015 various lists of Sharing Economy companies were published, and they often had hundreds of examples. But for some analysts, this was just the beginning. PwC is one of the most consistently upbeat forecasting agencies around the Sharing Economy, and have forecast markets sizes well into the hundreds of billions of dollars in a few years time. It looks like the Sharing Economy is taking off.\nWith those specific examples in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s take one more look at a definition.\nFirst, we have the platform, and that\u0026rsquo;s the Sharing Economy company. Perhaps it is Homejoy, or DogVacay, or Lending Club. It matches service providers to consumers. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take on providing the service itself, but it does handle payments, identity verification, and ratings. Rating systems were often called out as one of the main innovations of the Sharing Economy. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman lauds \u0026ldquo;Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s real innovation\u0026mdash;a platform of \u0026lsquo;trust\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;where everyone could not only see everyone else\u0026rsquo;s identity but also rate them as good, bad or indifferent hosts or guests. This meant everyone using the system would pretty quickly develop a relevant \u0026lsquo;reputation\u0026rsquo; visible to everyone else in the system.\u0026rdquo; 10 Friedman was writing just a couple of weeks after his New York Times stablemate David Brooks described \u0026ldquo;How Airbnb and Lyft Finally Got Americans to Trust Each Other\u0026ldquo;: \u0026ldquo;Companies like Airbnb establish trust through ratings mechanisms \u0026hellip; People in the Airbnb economy don\u0026rsquo;t have the option of trusting each other on the basis of institutional affiliations, so they do it on the basis of online signaling and peer evaluations.\u0026rdquo; 11\nOn the consumer side we have seen that the Sharing Economy fits into and help to shape a trend of particularly young people as valuing experiences over ownership, and choosing access over ownership. Your books and music may already be on devices: why buy a car when you can take an Uber? Everything you need is on your phone or your computer.\nAnd then there are the service providers, who are presented as partners rather than employees. The word that used early on was \u0026ldquo;micro-entrepreneurs\u0026rdquo;: not really companies, not really private individuals, but somewhere in between. And by making the most of their unused assets they were being green, building community, and making a little money.\nBusiness models and strategy Not all sharing economy business models are novel, or successful, but when it comes to strategy there are some distinctive features for this sector.\nThe appeal of platforms to investors lies in the idea of increasing returns to scale. There is a popular phrase that you may have seen. The biggest hotel company -- Airbnb -- owns no property. The biggest taxi company -- Uber -- owns no cars. This mimics the way that Facebook and YouTube own no content. Each is as big as the biggest company in their market. The value, it seems, is in the platform.\nOne of the benefits of this model is that if a company sees demand, it can grow very quickly and globally. Just as other Internet companies have spread around the world, so can Airbnb and Uber. If a hotel chain wants to add another 100 rooms it has to build a hotel, but for Airbnb it\u0026rsquo;s just another row in a database. So on the supply side there are benefits here, sometimes labelled as a \u0026ldquo;zero marginal cost\u0026rdquo; business structure.\nThere are increasing returns on the demand side as well as on the supply side, and they go under the name network effects. Renters want to be where travellers are, and travellers want to be where renters are. So just like social media, every person who takes a trip on Airbnb, and every person who adds a listing, makes it more attractive for everyone else.\nOne of the things about increasing returns to scale is that it makes it difficult for new companies to enter the market: it favours a natural monopoly, or at least oligopoly. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix have few real competitors. And this industrial organization makes profits possible.\nZero marginal costs and network effects: put the two together and you can see why investors are enthusiastic. Can Airbnb and Uber do for services what Amazon has done for retail, what Wikipedia did for the encyclopedia, and Apple and Spotify have done for music? Is the market in these services a winner-take-all? The large scale of venture capital investment shows that a lot of people are prepared to bet that it is.\nThere is a real pressure among startups to grow quickly, and one of the strategies that gained prominence early was a piece of advice given to Airbnb by their early investor Y Combinator: do things that don\u0026rsquo;t scale. 12\nWhen a company starts, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the benefit of network effects so it can\u0026rsquo;t rely on them. Instead it needs something different to set itself apart and get growth started. For Airbnb that was visiting hosts in its first significant market, and helping them present their listings in an attractive way on the site. Paying for a photographer was a big step forward: it made a big difference to those early listings and got the idea of homesharing started.\nBut of course in business everyone wants a winning formula, and applying it blindly is rarely successful. Another Sharing Economy company, Washio, set out to do the same as Airbnb but for laundry: the company was going to \u0026ldquo;demolish laundry\u0026rdquo;. 13 They gave each customer cookies, and packaged the laundry with sleek black bags. But it turned out that the ideas of the Sharing Economy don\u0026rsquo;t really work for laundry. To start with the cost side: most of the cost is involved in actually doing the laundry and digital technology doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with that. On the demand side: just because other people are doing their laundry through Washio doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a big difference to me, so network effects were limited. And because of that, the strategy was just losing money on every sale. Washio ceased operations in 2016.\nThere is another aspect of business strategy that was central to the growth of the Sharing Economy. I\u0026rsquo;ve touched on it a couple of times. Many of these companies did not just see themselves as businesses, they were also a movement: brands with a purpose.\nThe companies fostered a community of so-called micro-entrepreneurs and leaned heavily on ideas of democratization. Instead of relying on faceless corporations we can now provide services to each other, in a \u0026ldquo;peer to peer\u0026rdquo; fashion. You don\u0026rsquo;t need a bank to get a loan, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a hotel to take a holiday, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a taxi to get across town, you just go to the Internet and click or tap. The idea appeals to those already invested in new technologies: the old rules don\u0026rsquo;t apply, we have a better way now. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said that most of the reasons for regulation in the accommodation and transport spaces were consumer protection, and reputation systems could carry out that task better than cities. 14\nSo the Sharing Economy shared a moment with the growth of Wikipedia, with the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and the idea of Facebook revolutions and social media as a democratizing force in politics. The internet was no longer this place you went to when you sat at a desk, it was moving into the real world, and taking its values with it.\nBut from the beginning there were tensions built into the Sharing Economy, and the name captures the problem. Is this about a community or a business?\nOn the one hand it\u0026rsquo;s about sharing: it\u0026rsquo;s social, it\u0026rsquo;s community-focused, and personal. On the other hand, it\u0026rsquo;s an economy: it\u0026rsquo;s about market transactions and prices, where scale is the key to profit and perhaps to monopoly rents.\nThe tensions were captured in an organization set up in 2013 called Peers. It called itself a grassroots movement set up to clear out old-fashioned regulations and clear a path for the new sharing economy companies. But it was founded by Airbnb, whose goal was to make money.\nIn the same way, the companies were touted as democratizing, but were set up with the goal of making money for investors, including some of the richest people on the planet.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an attitude that has been called the Californian Ideology, 15 which is that you can have both. You can be rebellious, anti-establishment, and against hierarchy; but you can also make a big pile of money while doing it. You can be ethical, and live a life of purpose, and you can be rich beyond your wildest dreams.\nBut some early examples showed that you cannot have everything, and when it comes to choosing between community and profit, commercial enterprises will choose profit.\nFall? I hope that gives an idea of the ideas behind the Sharing Economy. It\u0026rsquo;s been ten years now, and there has been a perhaps-inevitable shakeout.\nFor many of the \u0026ldquo;Uber for X\u0026rdquo; companies, like Washio, the promise of new efficiencies has proved hard to achieve. The unpleasant surprise was perhaps told best by Sarah Kessler, who went back to look at the story of the drill. 16 She showed that many of those companies who were looking to follow the Sharing Economy template were not growing fast. Going across town to get a drill from someone you don\u0026rsquo;t know when you can buy one for \\$50 was too much of a problem.\nWe have already seen that Washio went bust because its business model did not reflect reality. Laundry, it turns out, is laundry. In the same way, the cleaning company Homejoy was set up with \\$30 million from Google Ventures, but any efficiency it gained came at the cost of its cleaners, who were reported in one revealing article as living under bridges. 17 The cost of cleaning is what you pay the cleaners. The Internet only helps with that if you can push costs, like the time to travel, onto the cleaners. And obviously they did not want to bear that cost, so Homejoy had a hard time keeping staff.\nAdding to the problem is that once a homeowner has found a good cleaner, they probably want the same one again, so the matching problem is not a huge benefit, and if the cleaner is really a micro-entrepreneur, then the homeowner can just make a deal with them directly and cut out Homejoy\u0026rsquo;s portion of the cost. Homejoy went out of business a few years to.\nOther companies had to carry out what technology companies call a \u0026ldquo;pivot\u0026rdquo;: change their business model to something different. TaskRabbit has sold itself to Ikea, and Instacart has partnered with grocery chains, so both are now a source of cheap labour for orthodox businesses rather than a peer-to-peer alternative. Perhaps the biggest pivot was in the \u0026ldquo;peer-to-peer lending\u0026rdquo; market. The companies struggled with high rates of default, and ended up changing the name to what they call \u0026ldquo;marketplace lending\u0026rdquo;. Most of the loans for these companies now come from regular financial institutions, rather than individuals. The role of the platforms has changed to be that of an automated loan officer: algorithmically assessing the credit-worthiness of applicants, and supplying those assessments to the financial institutions who can decide whether or not to make the loan.\nWhat does this tell us? For many companies, the Internet has not been the game changer they thought. For others, the Internet has worked, but they have had to move from the Sharing Economy model. And that leaves us focusing again on the survivors.\n2018: Full circle? In 2018 it seems like we are nearly back to where we started: left with two successful industries\u0026ndash; ridesharing and short-term rentals. There is Airbnb and there is Uber.\nBut while the overall phenomenon of the Sharing Economy may be fading, these two are still growing rapidly. A look at their success is still valuable because of their size and impact, and also because some of the aspects of their business is a first look at the next wave of innovation, in which the service providers themselves are algorithms instead of people. The world of autonomous vehicles and AI services will be platform-based businesses that face many of the same challenges as the Sharing Economy.\nIt seems like Airbnb and Uber are two cases where the Sharing Economy model worked: zero marginal costs and network effects combining to give runaway success. But for Uber at least, it may be too early to say that.\nUber is often described as a company like Amazon, or Google, or Apple: one that has changed the nature of the world in which we live. It is easy to forget that Uber is still not a profitable company, and as financial quarter after quarter goes by with large losses (over \\$1 Billion in 2018 Q3 18), it is becoming increasingly doubtful whether its business model is sustainable. 19\nUber\u0026rsquo;s challenge is to keep both drivers and riders happy. If it raises prices it loses riders and if it keeps them low then driver retention becomes a challenge. Much of the early enthusiasm for the company assumed that this balancing act was solvable because of the huge efficiency increases that Uber was bringing to the industry, helping riders and drivers find each other and eliminating idle time for drivers. The enthusiasm peaked with a 2014 report in the Washington Post suggesting that some Uber drivers were earning \\$90,000 a year, 20 but that story quickly vanished and now the stories are far more often about drivers earning less than minimum wage, or facing financial difficulties because they are unable to keep up payments on a leased car. 21\nSo far Uber has solved its problem by throwing money at it. Uber subsidises rides by providing enticements to the drivers, burning through billions of dollars of capital while looking with increasing desperation for a profitable business model.\nRecent reports from New York City suggest that Uber and Lyft cars are empty for at least as much of the time as the traditional \u0026ldquo;yellow cabs\u0026rdquo;.22 This is not the case everywhere, but it suggests that efficiency in its current market is not likely to drive profitability. Maybe squeezing more out of drivers will be a way to do it? Uber is investing in dynamic pricing, driver incentives, and a myriad of other techniques for taking more out of every rider\u0026rsquo;s dollar 23, but we should not be too quick to assume they will succeed. It remains possible that Uber is a blip.\nMeanwhile, Airbnb is profitable, but that is a low bar to reach for a company valued at \\$31 Billion, whose repeated attempts to break into \u0026ldquo;whole trip\u0026rdquo; planning and business travel have been unsuccessful.\nStill, both these companies have shown that rapid and global growth is possible. They have done so at the cost of continual controversy in cities around the world where they have become popular. There are many different controversies, but many have a common origin. We highlighted the need for Sharing Economy companies to have a \u0026ldquo;zero marginal cost\u0026rdquo; model, but that model relies on the company itself not having significant new expenses for each service provider or each transaction. And it has become clear that \u0026ldquo;zero marginal cost\u0026rdquo; is not a feature of the technology alone, it also depends on the laws that govern the company\u0026rsquo;s actions.\nSharing Economy companies present themselves in their terms and conditions as a marketplace. Uber\u0026rsquo;s user agreement, for example, says \u0026ldquo;Your ability to obtain transportation\u0026hellip; through the use of The Services does not establish Uber as a provider of transportation, logistics or delivery services or as a transportation carrier\u0026rdquo;. The assertion is that the exchange itself, and anything that may go wrong with it, is between the consumer and the service provider, not the consumer and Uber. Other sharing economy companies present themselves in the same way. Financially, this gets them off the hook for liability and other problems, and they have relied on a particular American law to sustain this position. Section 230 of the \u0026ldquo;Communications Decency Act\u0026rdquo; includes this phrase:\n No provider\u0026hellip; of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\n These sentences were written with web sites like YouTube in mind. The hosting platform itself was protected from liability for the actions of the users on the site. If someone uploads illegal videos to YouTube, YouTube is at least partially protected from responsibility.\nWhether Section 230 to the Sharing Economy is still in dispute. The European Court of Justice recently ruled that Uber may not qualify for this kind of protection:\n The service provided by Uber is more than an intermediation service\u0026hellip; The ride-booking company must be classified as \u0026lsquo;a service in the field of transport.\u0026rsquo; 24\n In 2016 a London tribunal judge was even more direct:\n The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common \u0026lsquo;platform\u0026rsquo; is to our minds faintly ridiculous. 25\n The end result will not be a simple outcome, as it depends on laws in different jurisdictions and will vary from company to company. But the impacts are huge: all kinds of disputes surrounding these companies focus on their responsibility for some aspects of their business that they are trying to avoid. Here is a brief list:\n Are Uber drivers employees? Their flexibility suggests not, but that is not the only criterion for employment: many jurisdictions also weigh independence while on the job as a criterion, and Uber drivers do not set their own prices, do not get to select riders, and have many small controls over how they do their job. Many would say that full-time Uber drivers, which is a large part of the overall business, should qualify for many of the benefits that employees get. This would add significantly to Uber\u0026rsquo;s costs, and present them with even more financial problems. 26\n In the same way, Airbnb maintains that it is not responsible if its hosts break the law or break their tenancy agreements in offering their space for rent, but the company also makes it very difficult for cities to go after hosts because Airbnb does not, in general, share host information with the cities where it operates. 27 Again, the outcome of this dispute will have a real effect on Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s cost structure.\n While Brian Chesky was confident that his rating systems could solve consumer protection problems, it has turned out that there are many that ratings cannot address. 28 Whether it is providing a usable complaint system, ensuring vehicle safety, ensuring the safety of Airbnb apartments, so far the Sharing Economy companies have avoided many of the costs that other providers of commercial services have to undertake. To the extent that they have to take on the cost of things going wrong for consumers, the zero-marginal cost model will vanish.\n As all the transactions on the platform go through the Internet, both companies have set up shell structures so that they are routed through subsidiaries in tax-friendly jurisdictions. 29 By not paying into the tax base of the cities where they operate, the companies are essentially parasitic on cities.\n There are also many aspects of running cities that governments care about, from road congestion to housing affordability, where there have been continual disputes about the responsibility of the platform companies. Airbnb has long promoted a vision of openness and authenticity, promising that you could \u0026ldquo;live like a local\u0026rdquo;, but in some of their biggest markets the locals have not been so happy about it: Paris neighbourhoods have been losing population, Barcelona has said \u0026ldquo;bring refugees, keep out tourists\u0026rdquo;. Managing tourism effectively is a matter of balance, and cities are becoming increasingly assertive in their dealings with Airbnb.\n  The lesson from all these disputes is that the business model of new technology companies is not dictated solely by the technology itself, it also reflects the responsibilities we expect companies \u0026ndash; particularly large global companies \u0026ndash; to accept in order to operate.\nIt has been interesting to watch cities become more assertive over time. When Airbnb and Uber appeared on the scene full of brash promises, they were intimidated by the challenge to get on board with the future or be left behind, especially when the platforms could mobilize thousands of happy customers and service providers to lobby on their behalf. But now cities are realizing that some problems are shared, and that they have choices beyond \u0026ldquo;take it or leave it\u0026rdquo;. Major tourist cities are now regularly talking to each other about their successes and failures when dealing with Airbnb, for example, and out of this is growing a new set of rules that balance the interests of tourists with those of the citizens in the places they visit.\nIf the \u0026ldquo;zero marginal cost\u0026rdquo; model is shaped by laws as much as by technology, it raises the question of who builds the future? The debates around the Sharing Economy mirror earlier debates that have grown around technological innovation, from the industrial revolution on. Changes are one part technological, and one part social, and getting the social arrangements right is just as important for a healthy future as getting the technology right. Those in the 19^th^ century who fought for child labour protections or the forty hour working week or the vote were just as much a part of building the future as the new industrialists and inventors.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the same today. Technology will be a part of the changes that shape the lives of our children, but so too will the legal and social changes that surround them. So an understanding of history, of economics, of society and what a good society needs is just as important as developing a new twist on an artificial intelligence algorithm when it comes to shaping the future. Educators in particular play an important role in ensuring the next generation has the critical faculties and understanding of society that is going to be needed to ensure they have a healthy planet and a healthy relationship with our computational future.\nThe future of transport and travel is not being made only by the technology companies, it is being made in city government offices around the world. It will be made not just by today\u0026rsquo;s computer science students, but by our economics students and business students as well.\n Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers, What\u0026rsquo;s Mine Is Yours: The Rise of\rCollaborative Consumption (Harper Business, 2010).\r^ Airbnb, \u0026lsquo;Fast Facts\u0026rsquo;, Airbnb Press Room, 2018\r\u0026lt;https://press.airbnb.com/en-uk/fast-facts/\u0026gt; [accessed 27\rNovember 2018].\r^ \u0026lsquo;InterContinental Hotels Group\u0026rsquo;, Wikipedia, 2018\r\u0026lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=InterContinental_Hotels_Group\u0026amp;oldid=869295066\u0026gt;\r[accessed 27 November 2018].\r^ Crunchbase, \u0026lsquo;TaskRabbit\u0026rsquo;, CrunchBase\r\u0026lt;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit\u0026gt; [accessed 19\rJune 2015].\r^ Ellen MacArthur Foundation, \u0026lsquo;What Is a Circular Economy? | Ellen\rMacArthur Foundation\u0026rsquo;, 2017\r\u0026lt;https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept\u0026gt;\r[accessed 27 November 2018].\r^ Lisa Gansky, The Mesh: Why the Future of Business Is Sharing\r(Portfolio / Penguin, 2010).\r^ World Economic Forum, \u0026lsquo;Collaboration in Cities: From Sharing to\r\u0026ldquo;Sharing Economy\u0026rdquo;\u0026lsquo;, World Economic Forum, 2017\r\u0026lt;https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/collaboration-in-cities-from-sharing-to-sharing-economy/\u0026gt;\r[accessed 27 November 2018].\r^ Toronto Tool Library, \u0026lsquo;Toronto Tool Library \u0026ndash; Access | Share |\rInnovate\u0026rsquo; \u0026lt;https://torontotoollibrary.com/\u0026gt; [accessed 27 November\r2018].\r^ Rachel Botsman, \u0026lsquo;The Case for Collaborative Consumption (TED\rTalk)\u0026lsquo;, 2010\r\u0026lt;https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption?language=en\u0026gt;\r[accessed 27 November 2018].\r^ Thomas L.

Long a bicycle-mad city, its nine-year-old Bixi ride-share program is well used and convenient, with over 6,000 bikes sprinkled around its 500 docks throughout the city.1 But what really makes the difference is not so much the bikes themselves, or the docks, or the payment system, as the separate bike lanes and 700 km of cycle paths that make it safe to cycle around.2 Without investment in infrastructure, the bikes themselves would not make much difference.\nThe same goes in the Netherlands: the Dutch own more bicycles per person than any other country in the world, and almost a quarter of the Dutch population cycles every day.3 In Amsterdam there are twice as many bikes as cars on the street during rush hour. And the reason is the roads: 35,000 km of dedicated cycling infrastructure (separate lanes) and a low speed limit.\nInfrastructure innovations make a difference. And while bicycles may not be the future of transport, the lesson applies to other forms of big city transport. It\u0026rsquo;s a lesson worth keeping in mind with the flood of transport stories that is coming from the technology industry.\nUber has changed the way many people get around cities. And Uber\u0026rsquo;s success has produced imitators; a whole generation of technology-inspired transport visions from Silicon Valley and from China. Shared bikes (docked and now dockless) and motorized scooters share the headlines with pooled ridesharing, Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s tunnels and driverless cars as the transport of the future. It can seem that transit innovation is coming from technology companies and not from cities. But appearances can be deceptive and in this case they are. It is cities (city governments and citizens) who will shape the transit of the future, and they should look to each other for inspiration rather than to Uber and Tesla. Because the challenge is not so much about vehicles as about space: not so much about cars as about roads.\nWhen Uber moved from being a status-conscious “everybody\u0026rsquo;s private driver” to being a mode of mass transit, it promised a sustainable future. We would need less parking space and would live more economically as private cars faded away; replaced by transport as reliable as running water. And they would help cities be more efficient by sharing their traffic flow data, helping to optimize the use of our roads. But while Uber has grown rapidly year on year, it is not a template for healthy transit futures.\nOne reason is that, remarkably, Uber continues to be unprofitable. With every quarter\u0026rsquo;s financial results the path to profitability seems less certain. Maybe Uber has grown not just because of its revolutionary application, but because it subsidizes car rides.4 Sooner or later, it is going to have to make a profit; for commuters, cost matters, and the idea that everyone can ride an Uber to work may not make economic sense in the long run.\nA second reason is that Uber is increasingly leading to congestion.5 In major cities, Uber is competing with more space-efficient mass transit, not complementing it as it promised. New York City is the best studied city, where 60,000 Uber and Lyft vehicles are slowing the traffic by about 30%. These vehicles spending as much time driving empty as a regular yellow cab, despite the high-tech matching algorithms, and put 2.8 new miles on the road for each mile of personal driving removed.6 Even the shared services such as Uber Pool have similar statistics. This is no way to build a sustainable transport infrastructure, and self-driving vehicles would have exactly the same problem. Smartphones are part of our present and our future, but they won\u0026rsquo;t fix traffic.\nFor more important innovation, look to Mexico City: since it pioneered its Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) with dedicated lanes and frequent service, its steadily growing fleet (now over 700 buses) move 1.8 million people a day.7 In New York City Uber provides 6 rides per vehicle every day; in Mexico City the BRT provides 2500 rides per vehicle. Other forms of mass transit are similar: in London, 2 million people per day ride on about 700 tube trains for over 2000 rides per vehicle. When it comes to moving lots of people in a big city, mass transit is the way. Congestion, as traffic expert Jarrett Walker likes to say, is a matter of urban geometry.8\nIf we are looking to a future of bigger cities, denser city centres, then we need to make mass transit cool again, and throw off its shabby image (especially in North America). It will be investment in roads, paths, and buses that will improve our cities, and those will come from city governments looking to each other, learning from each other\u0026rsquo;s innovations and experimenting with new variations. When it comes to transit, the ballot box is a more important technology of change than the smartphone.\n “BIXI Montréal.”\r^ Bruemmer, “Montreal\u0026rsquo;s Bike Path Network: Mind the Gaps.”\r^ “Dutch Cycling Figures | BICYCLE DUTCH.”\r^ Horan, “Will the Growth of Uber Increase Economic Welfare?”\r^ LeBlanc, “Studies Are Increasingly Clear.”\r^ Schaller, “The New Automobility: Lyft, Uber and the Future of American Cities”; Schaller, “Unsustainable?

Bill Gates thinks your programs should be cut in favor of STEM subjects, his fellow tech-billionaire Vinod Khosla says “little of the material taught in liberal arts programs today is relevant to the future,” and Marc Andreesen says you will end up working in a shoe store. Maybe you should just learn to code.     Tech billionaires claim that fuzzies—students of the liberal arts and social sciences—are doomed to working in shoe stores, but two new books pin the future of tech on them.     Or maybe not. Two new books make a case that the technology industry can no longer be driven purely by software engineer hackers, and that you have a critical role to play in guiding it in more ethical and humane directions. That said, their authors differ dramatically about what that role is. Scott Hartley wants you to bring your skills and insights to the world of technology startups, to unlock the full potential of technological innovation. Ed Finn, on the other hand, seeks to hold the technology industry to account: he believes we need “more readers, more critics,” posing questions about who technology serves, and to what ends...

Note that such an estimate will not be reliable for an individual listing (especially as reviews occasionally vanish from the site), but over a city as a whole it should be a useful metric of traffic. overall_satisfaction: The average rating (out of five) that the listing has received from those visitors who left a review. accommodates: The number of guests a listing can accommodate. bedrooms: The number of bedrooms a listing offers. price: The price (in $US) for a night stay. In early surveys, there may be some values that were recorded by month. minstay: The minimum stay for a visit, as posted by the host. latitude and longitude: The latitude and longitude of the listing as posted on the Airbnb site: this may be off by a few hundred metres. I do not have a way to track individual listing locations with last_modified: the date and time that the values were read from the Airbnb web site.  The first line of the CSV file holds the column headings.\nHere are the cities, the survey dates, and a link to download each zip file.\nAarhus Survey dates: 2016-10-28 (2258 listings), 2016-11-26

I thought I was reading for entertainment, but they have been the best guide to what to expect from Trump that I’ve come across.  Henry was a second son, not brought up to be king, and he was spoiled. He could not bear that anyone be better than him, at riding, at archery, at jousting, whatever.\nSo what Gregory’s books convey very well is how not to deal with a privileged and powerful narcissistic orange bully with no attention span. Henry could flatter and be generous, and the objects of his flattery would think they had influence. But when Henry’s needs or wants changed, or when anything went badly, these people were suddenly cast aside. His wives are the obvious examples, but counsellors and ambassadors and nobles too.\nAll of a sudden, they would hear that Henry was disappointed in them. That after years of friendship and loyalty, Henry was dismayed to find that they had let him down (because nothing, ever, was Henry\u0026rsquo;s fault). And then they would simply be frozen out, unable to reach him, refused entrance to court. And maybe they would lose their head. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell: both had their moment, and then didn\u0026rsquo;t. (Maybe don\u0026rsquo;t be called \u0026ldquo;Thomas\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Anne\u0026rdquo; either)\nSo when I see people saying that Trump understands them (the Canadian government, the technology leaders who paid court), that — in the words of the tech leaders — they will set him straight if he goes off-course, I think: you have no idea how this works. Of course he and his crew will flatter you, tell you how brilliant you are, how much he admires you. Until he doesn’t. Until he decides that you have disappointed him. And then you will hear about it second hand, or maybe through Twitter. You’re out, and the axe will fall, and you’re not so special after all.\nThose “realist” commentators who say they can manage Trump (with a bit of flattery here, a few wise words there) need to read about Henry VIII to see how that story ends.\nIf that takes too long, they should at least follow @KngHnryVIII on Twitter, who set it out in August here. From which:\nLet me put it this way, you know that feeling of anxiety and fearful remorse that can steal over you in the darkest hours of the night? I don’t have that. Neither does Trump. Update: David Golumbia points out that Sean Spicer\u0026rsquo;s infamous first press conference may be an example. Told to deliver a stinging rebuke, he follows his master\u0026rsquo;s bidding. When the rebuke causes problems, Trump hangs him out to dry, saying maybe he went too far. That\u0026rsquo;s what you get for riding an orange tiger.\n","date":1484975880,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"187ac43802b12f9308f8fc0d0f2cf9cd","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/on-orange-tyrants/","publishdate":"2017-01-21T05:18:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/on-orange-tyrants/","section":"post","summary":"A few months ago I read a couple of historical novels by Philippa Gregory, set in the reign of Henry VIII (The King’s Curse, and The Taming of the Queen).

First, the company has been under pressure for exacerbating the city's housing affordability crisis (Vancouver's housing market is [the most expensive in North America](http://globalnews.ca/news/2477598/vancouver-ranked-3rd-least-affordable-housing-market-in-the-world-survey/)), so this looks like asking for more trouble. Second, Airbnb in Vancouver is already going gangbusters, so why does Airbnb feel the need to pay out to attract new hosts?  Here is a chart that shows what I mean by \u0026rdquo;gangbusters\u0026rdquo;. The y axis is the total reviews per month for a set of North American cities, with Vancouver picked out in bold red. The total number of visits is probably about one-and-a-half times this number, so it\u0026rsquo;s a measure of overall Airbnb traffic in the city. You can see there is a seasonal trend, with traffic dropping off over winter and picking up again in summer, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear that this summer\u0026rsquo;s peak is well above last summer for most of these cities. Vancouver is now running at well over twice the volume of last year. (Click to expand, and hit the back button to return to the post)\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s another way of looking at this growth. Vancouver is again highlighted in bold red in the chart below, which unpacks the overall traffic shown above. The x axis is the number of listings in the city, and the y axis is the average occupancy rate measured as the number of reviews per month per listing. Multiply them together and you get the total traffic for the city.\nFor most cities the trend is to more listings, with the occupancy rate going through the same seasonal trend we saw up above. (Although Philadelphia and Chicago are not doing so great, and San Francisco (the curly green line) seems to have hit a limit of listings, probably because of the drastic action Airbnb is taking to legitimize itself in that city. But that\u0026rsquo;s another story.)\n\nAn increase in traffic can come about two ways: more listings, or higher occupancy, and there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a trade-off between the two. So Toronto and Montreal (yellow and brown) have seen a rapid growth in the number of listings and the occupancy rate has grown significantly, but not massively. Meanwhile Vancouver has not seen such a rapid growth in the number of listings, but the occupancy rate is growing like topsy.\nNow if a hotel was counted as a single listing it would be way to the top left of this chart, while Airbnb wants to claim that its hosts are only occasionally renting out the place in which they live \u0026ndash; which translates into the bottom right. The fact that Vancouver listings are getting used more often could be bad news for Airbnb in its battle for legitimacy, so if it can attract more hosts they may take up some of the slack and move the line out to the right and down a bit.\nTo step back a bit, you do have to wonder if \u0026ldquo;bottom right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;top left\u0026rdquo; makes much of a difference from the actual affordability and neighbourhood impact perspective. If you live in an apartment building and every other person rents out their place once a month, that\u0026rsquo;s the same impact in terms of traffic, extra utilities and the other things people complain about than a small number of people renting out their places all the time. And thousands of tourists staying in a small neighbourhood will have a similar impact (good and bad) in some ways if they are scattered across many listings or huddled together in a few. And what about the impact on house prices in high-traffic hotspots? It\u0026rsquo;s not obvious to me that a large number of low-occupancy listings has less of an impact than a small number of high-occupancy listings, though I could be convinced either way.\nAnyway, I feel pretty confident that Airbnb is making its offer to offset the bad image that goes with the high-occupancy rates that Vancouver is now experiencing. And if there\u0026rsquo;s an offer for Seattle hosts, well that will confirm my suspicions.\nUpdate: Thanks to Caroline O\u0026rsquo;Donovan for pointing me to this: an Airbnb host promotion in Seattle. Suspicions confirmed!\n","date":1472432495,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"08667ac64b2351aeeb6bcc54b3569561","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/why-is-airbnb-offering-a-bonus-for-new-hosts-in-vancouver/","publishdate":"2016-08-29T01:01:35Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-is-airbnb-offering-a-bonus-for-new-hosts-in-vancouver/","section":"post","summary":"Here's an odd thing. Airbnb has a [new program in Vancouver](http://blog.airbnb.com/yvrdeals/), offering $250 cash bonus for first-time hosts.

At the prompting of some Lisbon urban geographers and activists concerned about the damage Airbnb is doing to the historic centre of their city, I've done some surveys of Lisbon.  The Airbnb report, as usual, presents some concrete figures, leaves out some other figures, and also presents a lot of figures that are not very interesting at all. It does so with the company\u0026rsquo;s traditional absence of supporting data or methods. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a few of the most important.\nAirbnb: \u0026ldquo;More than 4,500 hosts shared their space on Airbnb last year\u0026rdquo;\nMy results: Between May 2015 and May 2016, I identify 4633 separate hosts who have properties with reviews. There are over 6000 separate hosts with listings on the site. The Airbnb statement confirms the data I have collected.\nAirbnb: 72 percent of hosts in Lisbon have only one listing and hosts have lived in the city for an average of 25 years\nMy results: In my most recent survey, 71% of hosts have only one listing, confirming Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s statement.\nWhat Airbnb doesn\u0026rsquo;t say: 65% of listings in Lisbon belong to hosts with multiple listings. The majority of listings in Lisbon do not belong to regular folks who use the site only to occasionally rent out the home in which they live. The number of \u0026ldquo;multiple listing\u0026rdquo; hosts is growing even faster than the overall number of listings. The total number of listings almost doubled between May 2015 (5600) to June 2016 (over 10,000), and the percentage of listings belonging to multiple-listing hosts has grown from 59% of the total to 65% of the total. To me, this \u0026ldquo;percent of hosts with only one listing\u0026rdquo; is always the most deceptive of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s phrasings, and in the case of Lisbon it is particularly misleading.\nAirbnb: A typical listing in Lisbon is shared for 76 nights a year and more than half of all listings in Lisbon are rented for fewer than 90 days.\nMy results: I don\u0026rsquo;t have reliable occupancy data, but this claim also is noticeable for what it doesn\u0026rsquo;t say. There are about 2,000 Lisbon listings with no reviews at all: clearly a host with no guests causes no problems and makes no money, but using a median value (the \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo; listing) gives each of these listings equal weight. What is of interest is those at the top end: and of course there is not much said here. We can infer that almost half are rented for more than 3 months in the year, but we don\u0026rsquo;t know the concentration at the top end.\nWhat we do know is that the areas with most listings (Santa Maria Maior and Misericordia) have a disproportionate share of the business. Between them, they have about 40% of the listings but well over half of the visits, and (with prices there being more expensive) an even bigger share of the revenue. You can get a better idea of what this means by looking at the maps here (taken from my listings page), and download a full set of listings with each one:\n March 2015\n March 2016\n June 2016\n  Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s continued presentation of partial and biased \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; about its activities in cities around the world shows their lack of interest in accountability and, ultimately, their lack of interest in the cities where they operate.\n","date":1467425292,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"462b35213ac44796b74f4e1817c8e65a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/airbnb-in-lisbon-a-few-corrections/","publishdate":"2016-07-02T02:08:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/airbnb-in-lisbon-a-few-corrections/","section":"post","summary":"Airbnb just posted one of its charming city reports providing an Overview of The Airbnb Community in Lisbon and Portugal.

Arias/Quaglieri: There is a strong correlation between Airbnb listings and the presence of hotels. Airbnb supply is located to a large extent in the same neighbourhoods as hotels.\nAirbnb claim: Airbnb focuses on a new type of traveller seeking the authentic to immerse themselves in other cultures. Arias/Quaglieri: Analyzing languages spoken by hosts: the composition of the Airbnb host community is different from the profile of the area as a whole. Airbnb appears as a field for the ‘cosmopolitan consuming class’, where hosts and guests share a similar approach to the city around a ‘cosmopolitan sense of local’ from which a large proportion of the rest of the residents of Barcelona are excluded.\nAirbnb: proceeds from Airbnb allow hosts to cover their basic expenses and reach the end of the month Arias/Quaglieri: Airbnb hosts are not representative of the local communities. They are far more educated, have fewer children, and live in less-crowded households. While Airbnb hosting may help solve the prolems of people living in middle- to upper-class neighbourhoods, it is not a resource open to those in the poorer neighborhoods.\nA really interesting read, which is a significant step forward in the debate about Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s impact on the major tourist centres.\n","date":1464287705,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"a3afcc45a7a55dfa962e304bae8c708c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/airbnb-in-barcelona-two-readings/","publishdate":"2016-05-26T18:35:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/airbnb-in-barcelona-two-readings/","section":"post","summary":"A story on Ada Colau, who [may be the world's most radical mayor](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/ada-colau-barcelona-most-radical-mayor-in-the-world), hjighlighte how Airbnb can create problems for the cities where it operates:  Colau’s stated priority is to move Barcelona away from what she considers “massified tourism”, with no thought for sustainability, strategic planning or input from the public. “Until now, all we have had were private initiatives doing what they wanted,” Colau told me. “This has led to a model that is out of control.","tags":["airbnb"],"title":"\n\t\t\t\tAirbnb in Barcelona: two readings\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" A long overdue post.  There is no slowdown in the debates about how to regulate Airbnb, Uber, and other Sharing Economy companies, as city after city in country after country faces up to the challenges of how to deal with these new actors. If only there were a clearly thought-out, well-written work that spelled out the issues involved, provided a framework in which to think about how to respond, and provided a useful set of recommendations that provided the starting point for regulatory ideas.\nWell luckily there is.\nVanessa Katz\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Regulating the Sharing Economy\u0026rdquo; was published last September the Berkeley Technology Law Journal. I heard about it at the time (thanks Chris Hoofnagle), but I was just going through final edits on \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s Yours is Mine\u0026rdquo; and did not have a chance to write about it. I assumed someone else would, but a quick Google suggests that it has been overlooked. This is a shame. If you are interested in the topic, I strongly recommend it.\nNow I am not a lawyer, still less a legal scholar, so I don\u0026rsquo;t really know the standards that apply to law scholarship, but as someone concerned with the topic I can say this: there are proposals for regulation that have been picked up and become part of the public debate (eg from venture capitalist Nick Grossman,* self-regulation proponent Arun Sundararajan,* Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly*), and I learned more from Katz\u0026rsquo;s piece than from any of these. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the few articles I\u0026rsquo;ve gone back to over and over again because Katz offers a way to think through the issues, to go beyond the too-easy claim that new technologies and new businesses need new rules, and to think about what\u0026rsquo;s really new, and what\u0026rsquo;s left unchanged.\nA good starting point is to ask why we want to regulate some industries and not others, and Katz identifies a few principles that explain why we have a public interest in some private transactions. One class is \u0026ldquo;special relationships\u0026rdquo; in which the consumer is particularly vulnerable, and when additional burdens are placed on the service provider:\n Relationships that pose potential health, safety, and financial concerns for consumers: landlord-tenant relationship being one example.\n Relationships in which service providers have a disproportionately strong bargaining position: innkeepers and \u0026ldquo;common carriers\u0026rdquo; such as taxi drivers are required to accept all customers without discrimination. It\u0026rsquo;s a constraint on business, but one that is justified by the vulnerability of the customer.\n Relationships in which the service provider is the \u0026ldquo;least-cost avoider\u0026rdquo; - the party who can adopt precautions against a certain risk at lowest cost. Katz does not spell it out, but these situations are related to markets with asymmetric information: to keep the market working the service provider (as least-cost avoider) is required to guarantee certain standards: product liability being an example.\n  Sharing economy companies are quick to say that many existing regulations do not apply to them, but Katz is one of the few who asks the other question - what regulations are needed to deal with new challenges raised by the platform companies. Among these are reputation systems and their lack of appeal / process, privacy (a big deal when we start talking about in-car cameras, as well as customer data), and surge pricing (what happens when Uber offers personalized pricing based on your phone battery levels?)\nAll in all, an excellent read.\n","date":1464286029,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"644d94773fafc5eb67c2948dd037446b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/regulating-the-sharing-economy/","publishdate":"2016-05-26T18:07:09Z","relpermalink":"/post/regulating-the-sharing-economy/","section":"post","summary":"A long overdue post.

Pretty soon, I noticed an anomaly: what looked like a significant jump in the proportion of single-listing hosts between two surveys I had carried out, either side of the November 17 date Airbnb chose as a seemingly-random snapshot of their business. Murray Cox regularly collects data on Airbnb listings too at Inside Airbnb, so we talked about it. He looked at his data and thought he saw the same. So that\u0026rsquo;s interesting, we thought\u0026hellip;\nThen it was several weeks of questioning. We looked again and again at data reliability, we checked and cross-checked calculations, and we mulled over alternative explanations. There is good reason to expect Airbnb to be misleading: there is $25 Billion in fortunes to be made through a good IPO, and that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of pressure to make things look better than they are. But incentives are one thing, and reality is sometimes another. Airbnb routinely calls our data sets inaccurate (see here and here, for example), and even though comparisons to Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s own selective data releases have made us fairly confident, I did worry that going big on a story may set us up for failure and embarrassment if we had missed something obvious.\nFirst we asked ourselves: if these listings were actually removed, is this a story? Yes, we thought. If Airbnb removed listings immediately before making a \u0026ldquo;public data release\u0026rdquo; and never once mentioned doing so, it seemed like a clear case of using data to mislead, and given the high profile of the company\u0026rsquo;s original data dump (two New York Times stories, and many others) someone should be interested.\nCan we prove that the changes are not just noise? I scan the Airbnb web site for NYC periodically, but a survey I did in early November had given bad results (for boring technical reasons) so the bracketing data sets I had were from early October and early December - a bit too wide for comfort. But Murray\u0026rsquo;s data has proven more reliable than mine, and (tipped off by Ariel Stulberg of The Real Deal) he had run an additional survey on November 20. His data confirmed what I\u0026rsquo;d seen and more \u0026ndash; clearly there was something unusual that happened in early November.\nNext: are our calculations correct? Comparing Airbnb data sets on different dates is tricky because there is always significant churn on the site \u0026ndash; a lot of people put up a listing, get little interest or decide it\u0026rsquo;s not for them, and leave again. So I did my own calculations twice over (once in SQL, once using python pandas), and Murray did his own, and we compared, until we came to feel confident in them.\nAnd what about alternative explanations? Running similar calculations on a number of other cities (thank you Jupyter notebooks) showed nothing of similar size. Even the previous known purges (like April 2014) did not show up quite so dramatically. Given the timing, we were pretty confident that the change was prompted by Airbnb removals, but who knows?\nFinally: if Airbnb is removing \u0026ldquo;bad actors\u0026rdquo;, isn\u0026rsquo;t this a good thing? After talking it over with people I respect (thank you Lynne) we agreed that the big problem is one of trust. I managed to get the last word in the New York Times story on our report: Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business model depends on changing regulations in cities around the world, and so cities need to be able to trust Airbnb. By hiding what they did, Airbnb is acting in an untrustworthy manner. Their \u0026ldquo;Community Compact\u0026rdquo; (actually a unilateral document, not a compact) commits Airbnb to co-operating with cities and being transparent: this action was neither co-operative nor transparent.\nSo several rounds of edits later, and after many attempts to format graphs so as to put the message in a clear fashion, we released our findings as a report, and it got more coverage than I could have expected. I admit I was nervous about Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s response: a bad calculation or an overlooked reasonable explanation could leave us looking pretty stupid.\nIn the first story (in the New York Daily News) \u0026rdquo;Airbnb dismissed the findings, saying through a spokesman that \u0026lsquo;listings come on and go off throughout the year. We routinely review our listings to ensure guests are having the quality, local experience they expect and deserve\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; The way I read that, Airbnb is saying the changes we saw are just regular churn in the business, and implicitly denying that the company did anything special in that time. The \u0026ldquo;spokesman\u0026rdquo; also said that \u0026ldquo;The report also focuses on the busy marathon and Halloween weekend, when listings spiked\u0026rdquo;; a claim the company repeated to The Guardian.\nAfter a brief panic and a little reflection, it was clear to us that this explanation does not hold water. We hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen a spike in overall listings, we had seen a thousand more listings vanish from the platform than during other months, and almost exclusively these extra vanished listings were owned by hosts with multiple listings: there\u0026rsquo;s no reason for any special event to have such an effect.\nAs the day went on and coverage spread, Airbnb obviously got their act together and came up with a standard response. For example, here is what they sent to Fusion\u0026rsquo;s Kristen V. Brown:\n“The facts are clear for all to see—the vast majority of our hosts are everyday people who have just one listing and share their space a few nights a month to help make ends meet. Airbnb is an open people-to-people platform where listings come on and go off throughout the year. We’ve also done significant work to educate our community about what is in the best interest of their city and we routinely review our listings to ensure guests are having the quality, local experience they expect and deserve.”\nThe company provided one other piece of updated information, which was to share \u0026ldquo;a partial snapshot with Fortune of its New York City listings as of Feb. 8 that shows that 94% of hosts there only have one listing.\u0026rdquo;\nThe paragraph is fluff, sprinkled with generalities. The number they give (94%) actually matches what Murray and I had found rather than countering it (Figure 1 in the report). This response again made me feel more confident that we were on the right track.\nStill, I confess it was pretty sweet when, on Wednesday morning, Airbnb changed its tune. The company sent a letter and an FAQ to New York State representatives and posted the two documents on its site. I first heard of these documents from the above-mentioned Kristen Brown. Here is the key Q\u0026amp;A:\n**Did you remove listings from your community last fall? **\nYes. We issued our Community Compact in November. Throughout November, and consistent with our Compact commitments, we removed roughly 1,500 of the 37,000+ Airbnb listings in New York City in an effort to remove listings that appeared to be controlled by commercial operators and did not reflect Airbnb’s vision for our community. 622 hosts were impacted, including 375 (60%) that had 2 or more listings removed.\nThe company has changed its tune, and conceded that it did indeed remove listings (and did not tell anyone about doing so). Fusion\u0026rsquo;s report had a great headline:\nAirbnb admits that it purged 1,500 unflattering New York listings right before data release\nThe debate continues, of course. Working with Pat Clark of Bloomberg, Murray Cox has shown that some of the ejected listings have already started returning. The question of whether Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s own \u0026ldquo;vision for the community\u0026rdquo; is a sufficiently precise and legitimate criterion for removal will be debated (hint: No).

As I first reported on Airbnb in New York [two years ago](http://tomslee.net/2013/11/airbnb-business-in-new-york-revisited.html), when that business was a lot smaller, I was interested. Airbnb's Chris Lehane says \u0026quot;Our hope is that people will understand 99 percent of people on Airbnb in [New York City](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo) are using it as an economic lifeline,” and who could object to that? Would the real numbers show that we critics are wrong?  My work has been based on scrapes of the Airbnb web site (now done better by Murray Cox at Inside Airbnb), so it\u0026rsquo;s necessarily less accurate than Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s own data. On the other hand, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a $25 billion market valuation at stake in the answer, so it may be easier for me to be honest in my reporting.\nI hoped that \u0026ldquo;released\u0026rdquo; meant that I could get the data, but I was quickly disillusioned. It turns out to mean \u0026ldquo;made available only by making an appointment to visit Airbnb’s New York City office\u0026rdquo;, which is a bit of a joke. Instead, all we get is the summary statements from Airbnb PR. Still, it is better than nothing. So I read on\u0026hellip;\nMy first response to the New York Times article was dismay at this statement: \u0026ldquo;From November 2014 until November 2015, some 93 percent of revenue earned by active hosts in New York City who share their entire home came from people who have only one or two rental listings on the platform\u0026rdquo;. That is a number far higher than I had seen, and suggests that a much bigger portion of the Airbnb business is their archetypal \u0026ldquo;regular New Yorkers occasionally renting out the home in which they live\u0026rdquo; than I had thought. I had reported about 40% of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business coming from people with more than one rental listing and the numbers suggested 20% of business coming from people with more than two listings. Have I and other critics been getting it wrong? In the absence of complete data we have to make some estimates about income after all. This would be unfortunate as I have just PUBLISHED A BOOK ABOUT THE SHARING ECONOMY THAT MAKES A GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENT and that is critical of Airbnb.\nBut today the New York Times ran a correction: \u0026ldquo;From November 2014 until November 2015, some 75 percent of revenue earned by active hosts in New York City who share their entire home came from people who have only one or two rental listings on the platform.\u0026rdquo; (my emphasis). The change from 93% to 75% is significant: that\u0026rsquo;s almost four-fold increase in the proportion that comes from three-or-more listers. All of a sudden the Airbnb numbers look much more like those collected by myself and other external investigators, which Airbnb routinely say are inaccurate.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the real picture? Yes, 25% of Airbnb revenue in NYC comes from people renting out \u0026ldquo;more than two\u0026rdquo; listings. My own estimate actually comes out below that at 20% so my estimates are more friendly to Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; pitch than reality. My numbers also show that about 40% of total revenue comes from people with more than one listing, which is just what I reported two years ago. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that the real number is closer to half, given the way my estimates seem to underestimate revenue from \u0026ldquo;more than three\u0026rdquo; listers. In short, far from showing that the critics were wrong, Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s numbers show that our data, which they have been rubbishing, is pretty good and even generous to them: their numbers suggest that even more of the business comes from multiple listers than we have been claiming.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the right way to say it. \u0026ldquo;From November 2014 to November 2015, about half of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s revenue in New York City comes from multiple-listing hosts. Hosts with three or more listings contribute 25% of the total.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s a much more commercially-focused operation than the original claim.\nThe 93% number that Airbnb gave is, by the way, their projection on next year\u0026rsquo;s figures, to which I can only say - if you\u0026rsquo;re going to release data, maybe talk about the data and not about your dreams and aspirations? So far their supposed efforts to clamp down on hosts with many listings have been half hearted, and given that it may cut into their revenues we should not give it a lot of credibility. Airbnb has been talking the talk a long time about this challenge on their site, and yet so far they have done basically nothing about it (I\u0026rsquo;m travelling and don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the full data set at the moment, or I\u0026rsquo;d show you).\nMaybe more on this later. But for now, the new Airbnb numbers do nothing to undermine the critics\u0026rsquo; case.\n","date":1449022245,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"253a3239d319f5be966c52b3bd0d7d43","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/airbnbs-business-in-new-york-city/","publishdate":"2015-12-02T02:10:45Z","relpermalink":"/post/airbnbs-business-in-new-york-city/","section":"post","summary":"[According to the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/technology/airbnb-releases-trove-of-new-york-city-home-sharing-data.html), Airbnb yesterday \u0026quot;released\u0026quot; data about their business in New York City.

A first pass at this model is now available, together with a fairly long document describing how it works and some results, on GitHub as a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/tomslee/provider-reputation/blob/master/provider-reputation.ipynb).  I was particularly interested in a seeming paradox in what we have learned about real-world reputation systems. As I say in the introduction:\nIn the few years since they have become widespread, reputation systems have shown two seemingly contradictory characteristics:\n   (Lake Wobegon effect) Most ratings are very high. While ratings of Netflix movies peak around 3.5 out of 5, ratings on sharing economy websites are almost all positive (mostly five stars out of five). The oldest and most widely-studied reputation system is eBay, in which well over 90% of ratings are positive; other systems such as BlaBlaCar show over 95% of ratings as \"five out of five\".    (Panopticon effect). Service providers live in fear of a bad rating. They are very apprehensive that ratings given for the most frivolous of reasons by a customer they will never see again (and may not be able to identify) may wreck their earnings opportunities, either by outright removal from a platform or by pushing them down the rankings in search recommendations. Yelp restaurant owners rail at \"drive-by reviewers\" who damage their reputation; Uber drivers fear being \"deactivated\" (fired), which can happen if their rating slips below 4.6 out of 5 (a rating that would be stellar for a movie). So are reputation systems effective or not? Here\u0026rsquo;s the seeming contradiction:\n   The Lake Wobegon effect suggests that reputation systems are useless: they fail to discriminate between good and bad service providers (my take on this from a couple of years ago is [here](http://tomslee.net/2013/09/some-obvious-things-about-internet-reputation-systems.html)). This suggestion is supported by quite a bit of recent empirical research which I have summarized in [MY NEW BOOK!](http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/whats-yours-is-mine-by-tom-slee/). Customers are treating reviews as a courtesy, rather than as an opportunity for objective assessment. Rather like a guest book, customers leave nice comments or say nothing at all.    The Panopticon effect suggests that rating systems are extremely effective in controlling the behaviour of service-providers, leading them to be customer-pleasing (sometimes extravagantly so) in order to avoid a damaging bad review. If you are not a fan of computer models, or just have better things to do, here are my main conclusions, paraphrased:\n The model demonstrates the important role of social exchange compared to a pure market or transactional exchange in most customer\u0026ndash;service provider exchanges. It is this social exchange that is at the root of the Lake Wobegon effect, where all providers are above average. Reputation systems do indeed fail to discriminate on the basis of competence (quality).\n A small number of entitled customers can induce a Panopticon effect. Service providers who engage in Give \u0026amp; Take exchanges with their customers (even very competent ones) risk being given a negative review, which will damage their business. The incentives of the reputation system encourage providers to indulge their customers, in order to avoid this unlikely but damaging judgement.\n If reputation systems spread and customers become used to rating people in an \u0026ldquo;honest\u0026rdquo; fashion, we are building a terrible world for service providers. They must engage in emotional labour, catering to customer whims, or risk their livelihood. The Panopticon is here. The reputation systems continue, it should be noted, to fail to discriminate based on the competence of the service provider \u0026ndash; instead of changing quality, they change attitude.\n The Lake Wobegon effect and the Panopticon effect can coexist, and are coexisting. Reputation systems as they currently stand are failing to discriminate based on quality. But there is only one thing worse than a reputation system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and that\u0026rsquo;s a reputation system that does work: Reputation systems promise a dystopic future for service providers, in which their careers are being shaped by reputation systems that are not working as advertised, but are working to compel compliance.\n  ","date":1447016212,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d1ddf08cc721f8796bcef43d65c0748e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/lake-wobegon-and-the-panopticon-a-simulation-of-real-world-reputation-systems/","publishdate":"2015-11-08T20:56:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/lake-wobegon-and-the-panopticon-a-simulation-of-real-world-reputation-systems/","section":"post","summary":"For some time I have been working on a simulation of reputation systems: a computational model I can use to think through some of the issues they raise.

Swimming against the tide as a technophile and Internet enthusiast, she has come to believe that transport and communications networks in cities are about more than the market exchange of getting a ride. Also that Uber — a company that already squeezes its drivers as tightly as it possibly can — will squeeze even more tightly if it becomes unconstrained. Uber, Crawford says, is not a good idea for American cities.\nTim O’Reilly responded with Getting Over Taxis. He found Crawford’s arguments puzzling and unconvincing. He did some back-of-the-napkin math to show that Uber can be better for drivers than taxis. He concludes that while “common carriage” (uniform and universally accessible transport) is a noble goal, “when the private sector is doing a better job of providing that service than the previous government-chartered monopolies, government needs to get out of the way.”\nHere, I want to do two things:\n I think Tim O’Reilly’s back-of-the-napkin math about driver income gets some things wrong and I want to put another point of view.\n That said questions about driver income are probably not going to make the difference in this debate, which takes us back to Susan Crawford’s post.\n  (Aside: I’ll sometimes call them “O’Reilly” and “Crawford” below. Californians may feel this looks hostile, but that is not the intent. I’ve just never met either of them, so take it as old-style British formality.)\n(Do the Math: Taxi vs Uber)^2 Start with the questions about driver income. O’Reilly notes that taxi drivers typically rent his or her taxi from the owner, usually for a fee of just over $500 per week, after which, the driver keeps 100% of all fares and tips (but has to pay for gas). He compares this “gate fee” to the following Uber driver expenses:\n Uber’s 25–30% that it keeps of every fare.\n A $109 per week lease from Toyota, provided by Uber.\n  While it’s not easy to translate Uber’s cut into a weekly amount, O’Reilly notes that for this to equal the $500 per week gate fee for taxis, the driver would be making $2000 per week, which “seems unlikely”.\nThe equation, that Uber fee + lease is the equivalent of taxi lease and operating expenses (save gas) is off the mark. But I want to be constructive about this, so before I spell out an alternative, a few disclaimers:\n There is no one taxi driver. It’s a complicated industry; even within one city, there is complexity. In Toronto, for example, there have been moves to permit more owner-operators (ambassadors) to take some power away from fleet owners, and then some modifications to let ambassadors have one other driver (to get the most use out of their license) and so on. Different cities have different rules. Small towns are different from the big metropolises.\n There is no one Uber driver. The company sets very different rates in different cities ($2.15 per mile + $0.40 per minute in New York; $0.75 per mile + $0.15 per minute in Detroit), takes a different percentage of the fare, and even sets different “safety fees” ($0 in New York, $2.50 in Gary, Indiana, according to Biz Carson). And that’s before the whole surge pricing thing.\n I’m not an expert. If you want to take a look at the complexities of driver expenses by someone who is, see Lawrence Meyers’ dense 27-page epic “Towards A Cost Estimate of A NYC UberX Driver”. Of course, NYC is only one city and the picture will be different elsewhere; details clarify the picture, but details also muddy the picture.\n  So with all those caveats, here is what Tim O’Reilly missed: the $500 per week “gate fee” that he talks about includes maintenance, repairs, depreciation and insurance in addition to the fee that the vehicle owner takes. The Uber “fee plus lease” misses the cost of maintenance (except, I believe, for oil changes and tire rotations), repairs, and insurance. Once we include those costs, things look different: the short version is that most Uber drivers probably get about the same as most taxi drivers.\nHere’s the longer version. From what I could see last year, each dollar of a taxi fare gets split very roughly four ways: a quarter goes to the leaseholder, a quarter to the costs of car operation (including insurance), a quarter to gas, and a quarter to the driver. The “gate fee” is the leaseholder and the operation parts, so about half of the overall income.\nWhen it comes to Uber, a quarter (or over) goes to Uber, about half goes to gas and costs of operation (minus commercial insurance) leaving about a quarter for the driver.\nWhere does that “half” come from? Two places: one is a table in Meyers’ paper that lists the revenue per mile that a driver is earning, and the percentage of revenue that is lost. A percentage of 40 to 50% is in the middle of this chart:\nDriver expenses, as a function of revenue per mile, from Lawrence Meyers “Towards a Cost Estimate of a NYC Uber driver”\nA second is that Meyers’ cost estimate is a bit higher than the numbers calculated by Justin Singer and lower than the 57c per mile that the IRS allows, so it’s in the right ballpark (but remember, there are many different ballparks).\nSo from what I can see, the overall split is fairly similar between Uber and taxis.\nBut there are some other differences to remember, one in favour of Uber and one against:\n In its favour: Uber claims greater utilization (more rides per hour) which would lead to better incomes. The data it has provided in support of this is partial.\n On the other hand, there’s nothing here about commercial insurance. Adding commercial insurance is expensive (Meyers suggests an additional 8c per mile, which amounts to somewhere around 5% or so of the fare). Of course, most Uber drivers don’t take out this insurance: part of Uber’s cost advantage is that passengers and drivers are often taking uninsured rides.\n  (Aside: I recently attended an Uber driver information session. They did not mention insurance at all until an audience member asked about it, at which point they said it’s between the driver and the insurance company. They would have had to wink broadly to make it any more clear that they aren’t checking insurance and won’t ask questions.)\nWhat this leads to is that the Uber driver’s position is not so different from that of the taxi driver: both keep somewhere around a quarter of the fare, and increase utilization on Uber rides gets eaten up by the per-mile costs Uber drivers have to pay. While Tim O’Reilly says the amount you can make as an Uber driver is “almost surely higher than the median income for taxi and limousine drivers in 2012” I would suggest that it’s probably about the same, with quite a bit of variance both ways.\nI admit that the estimates above remain full of holes and the conclusions are wrapped in caveats, but there’s one other reason I have confidence in my overall conclusion that most of Uber’s drivers are not making significantly more than taxi drivers. If Uber had comprehensive data that proved drivers were making a good income after expenses they would shout it from the rooftops. The fact that they haven’t (all their posts and papers talk about “before expenses” income) tells us a lot.\nThe future Crawford argues that “ Uber consistently squeezes its drivers as tightly as it possibly can; new drivers are paying an even higher cut to Uber than the first generation did.” And I agree: the future is likely to be more difficult for Uber drivers.\nUber is currently losing money in its efforts to attract drivers and passengers. It’s possible that its Xchange car loan program is also a driver subsidy. But while losing money may help build the company pre-IPO, when accounts are private and growth is everything, it is not a sustainable strategy.\nWithin cities, the company keeps its own slice of the pie small when it gets started in a new location, to get riders and drivers onto the platform and to push the aggressive growth strategy it has adopted. It has then increased its cut in many places. Once the taxi companies have been pushed to the side, why should it continue to pay its drivers as much as it does now?\nWhere is the real dividing line? I might be wrong, but I suspect that all the above is beside the point.\nSusan Crawford talks about “My tribe — the technophiles, the Internet enthusiasts” being thrilled about Uber, and it’s the technophile part of this that is key: people who identify with the technology will generally identify with Uber. How we feel about Uber is shaped by how we feel about free markets and civic governance; who we identify with.\nFor all the argument, I suspect most people would have the same view of Uber whether their drivers make more than taxi drivers or make less. If taxi drivers make more than Uber drivers, then to some that would simply prove that taxi drivers are fat-cat monopolists who need to stop overcharging their customers and adjust to the new world. If Uber drivers make more than taxi drivers, then that just shows that the efficiency of new technology is taking us into a win-win world. And yes, I’m aware that identity-driven thinking goes the other way too.\nCrawford owns up to her bias: “I’m a fan of taxis wherever I find them.” So I should make my own bias clear. I work in the private sector technology industry, but I’m a big fan of democracy. Public transit and city-provided public services matter, warts and all. Personally, I’ve met fascinating people (travelling from San Francisco airport on the BART I met one of the authors of the Kyrgyzstan constitution) and it takes you to interesting places (the M60 bus from La Guardia into New York city takes you to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue— it took me a while to place the intersection, but who wouldn’t want to go there?) I live in a house near public transit and did so while my kids grew up so they could be mobile and independent.\nDoes technology drive business or does business drive technology? I see business as the lead here. And given the incentives at work, I cannot trust Uber. Its success is rooted not only in its technology, but in avoiding costs like sales tax (in many cities), like insurance, and (despite all the claims) like providing universal service. It succeeds (as Crawford hints) by avoiding the costs of being a constructive partner in the cities where it operates.\nIt’s easy to forget that Uber is not yet a publicly traded company, so any information about its business comes from leaks or press releases. Venture capital needs its successful exit, and as anyone who has looked for a date on Ashley Madison or a blood test from Theranos now knows, there are big incentives to paint a selective picture when billions are at stake. Once Uber is public, the incentives change: balanced books and cost control become more important. What happens when Uber has displaced taxis and then needs to squeeze its drivers a little harder?\nLooking even further ahead, Jathan Sadowski and Karen Gregory argue that Uber’s investors see this business model as an opportunity to privatize city governance. This is a damaging and antidemocratic goal. For a smallish city in Canada, what happens to accountability when faced with a massive American company with little interest in Canadian employment law or Canadian traditions? Two quick examples: as Michael Geist pointed out, Uber has no Canada-specific privacy policy, but what can Canadian cities do about it? And regardless of our labour laws, how can small cities respond when drivers are fired at will for being critical of the company or for unsubstantiated complaints by customers that cannot be appealed?\nThere’s one thing that Crawford and O’Reilly (and I) can agree on, which is that the sudden interest in urban transit that Uber has sparked may be valuable. I side with Crawford, because Uber is not just about getting a ride from A to B, it’s about our cities and the scope of our democratic institutions. Cities are more than the site for consumer-driven market exchanges. Where the line gets drawn between community, government and marketplace will differ from country to country, but what is constant is that people need a say in the decision: as citizens, not just as consumers. Local government, flawed as it is, is important — and it can be innovative. Cities need tending and democracy, not venture capital, is the best tool for that job.\nSelf-promotion alert: I have more to say about Uber and other sharing economy businesses in my book, “What’s Yours is Mine: Against the Sharing Economy”, coming soon from OR Books.\n","date":1445219432,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5653caf7dcfc2470ae13931b50a46385","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/uber-getting-over3/","publishdate":"2015-10-19T01:50:32Z","relpermalink":"/post/uber-getting-over3/","section":"post","summary":"This is cross-posted from Medium.\nThe story so far… Susan Crawford wrote about “Getting Over Uber”.

Here is Finley:\nTo protect consumers and realize its true promise, the Internet of Things must go the direction of the software and hardware that supports the Internet itself: it must open up... Today, the vast majority of smart home gadgets, connected cars, wearable devices, and other Internet of Things inhabitants are profoundly closed... Ostensibly, this is for your own protection. If you can’t load your own software, you’re less likely to infect your car, burglar alarm, or heart monitor with a virus. But this opacity is also what helped Volkswagen get away with hiding the software it used to subvert emissions tests. This seems wrong on two counts.\nFinley writes about initiatives like the OpenWrt operating system for embedded devices as an alternative, but a lot of IoT devices already run on Linux. What stops individuals from being able to exert control over their gadgets is the use of Linux permissions structures, not the openness of the OS code. IoT security frameworks will be much like security frameworks on Android and other mobile operating systems: sandboxed applications running in their own user space, using the security features of the operating system. The open source/closed source distinction is essentially irrelevant to the problem.\nFinley also writes that the closed nature of some IoT devices \u0026ldquo;makes it harder to trust that your thermostat isn’t selling your personal info to door-to-door salesmen or handing it out to the National Security Agency.\u0026rdquo; Which is ironic, because the software that might be handing out your personal info to the NSA is already open source. The NSA NiagaraFiles project provides routes data among different computer networks and protocols. The NSA recently released this software as open source, and it is now hosted as an Apache project called NiFi. So that is the open source community (in the form of Apache) actively assisting the NSA in its data collection activities. The core developers on the project are all from the NSA and defense contractors (link). And NiFi is being touted as a big thing for IoT applications, so that your personal info can be more effectively routed to more destinations. The NiFi project is one more step in the active collaboration of Apache with the NSA, which I discussed back here and here, and tangentially in my FORTHCOMING BOOK.\nThe VW case is important and raises some big questions, but open-source vs closed source software is not one of them. For a better take, see Zeynep Tufekci here.\n(Full disclosure and openness: in my day job I have some involvement in IoT projects.

Benjamin Sachs describes a new Interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act by the US Department of Labor, which makes it clear that there is more to the definition than just flexibility:\nemployee status under the FLSA is to be determined according to an “economic realities” test. With respect to the economic realities test, moreover, the Interpretation emphasizes that the test turns on a determination of whether the worker is “economically dependent on the employer (and thus its employee) or is really in business for him or herself (and thus its independent contractor). A driver putting in 50 hours a week in a car leased by Uber, to take one extreme, is clearly dependent on Uber. A driver putting in a few hours here or there, and also driving for Lyft, is much less dependent.\nMore from Sachs:\nWhat is the Nature and Degree of the Employer’s Control” Control is the last factor in the six-prong test, and it’s the last one the Interpretation discusses, but it may be the most relevant for Uber and Lyft. Why? Because the Interpretation takes up, and then dispenses with, two of the most common views about why on-demand workers ought to be considered independent contractors. First, the Interpretation states that the lack of direct supervision over how work is carried out is “largely insignificant” when workers work offsite. And, second, the Interpretation states that workers’ ability to determine _when _they work is also “not indicative of independent contractor status.” Citing the Third Circuit’s _DialAmerica Marketing_ decision, the Interpretation thus concludes that “the fact that the workers could control the hours during which they worked and that they were subject to little direct supervision was unsurprising given that such facts are typical of homeworkers and thus largely insignificant in determining their status.” In other words, you can be an employee even if you set your own hours and are never directly supervised. This is a conclusion with unmistakable relevance to the on-demand debate. Those defending companies\u0026rsquo; rights to classify their workers as independent contractors often warn that if the court cases succeed, then service providers will lose the flexibility that is part of the appeal of \u0026ldquo;gig economy\u0026rdquo; work:\n“The way we look at it, the laws governing employers require [them] to exert much more control over their employees, monitor, make sure they’re taking break times,” Ted Boutrous, Uber’s lawyer, said in a press conference last week. “It’s inevitable the flexibility and autonomy that drivers crave would have to be limited.” A spokesperson added that managing overtime would be another reason Uber would have to assign shifts. That\u0026rsquo;s from Carmel DeAmicis of re/code, who writes very smartly about this. She goes on:\nThey’re stretching the truth. Labor laws don’t prohibit flexible working conditions. If drivers were legally employees, they could still drive one hour one week and 40 the next. In a business like Uber’s, where apps track when workers are logged in, it would be easy for a company to send a push notification to people after four hours of work, requiring them to take a 15 minute break, or for the app to turn off after a 40-hour workweek to prevent overtime. Monitoring drivers would be easy for a company whose algorithms have optimized pricing at all hours. Benjamin Sachs also writes about the supposed loss of flexibility that would come with employee status:\nIf a court determines that these facts are consistent with a finding of employment, the drivers would be “employees.” But Uber would not somehow then be required to exercise additional control over when and how long the drivers worked, or over other aspects of the job that are currently flexible. Uber _would _be required to comply with minimum wage laws, safety and health laws, and anti-discrimination laws, and it would be required to contribute to unemployment insurance and withhold payroll taxes and the like. But it could do all of this without taking away the flexibility that the drivers currently enjoy. The big problem for Uber and others is that right now they have a cheap labour force who take all the risks associated with providing the service. Uber\u0026rsquo;s business model is based on avoiding regulations: it knows full well that most of its drivers do not have proper insurance for the work they do (I am sure this is one of the reasons that they never break down driver expenses in their claims about income), and may or may not pay full taxes on their income.\n","date":1443293920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"631d9fc3cc388b526e5879fb03d062eb","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/more-employeecontractor-cases/","publishdate":"2015-09-26T18:58:40Z","relpermalink":"/post/more-employeecontractor-cases/","section":"post","summary":"Boston lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan has brought two new lawsuits against on-demand delivery companies, claiming that those doing the deliveries should be classified as employees rather than as contractors.

A drill is a fairly inexpensive commodity. It’s easy to buy one, and it doesn’t take up much room in your house. And once you own it, you can use it any damn time you please. (The upside of low utilization is high availability.)... Buying and owning a drill, in other words, doesn’t involve much in the way of transaction costs, either up-front or ongoing. Now if, instead of buying the drill for yourself, you decide to share it with some other people, whether through a neighborhood co-op or some rental arrangement, suddenly you face all manner of transaction costs. You have to hash out the financial arrangements, you have to figure out where the drill happens to be at the moment you need it, and you have to go out and pick it up and bring it home (burning gas, perhaps, as well as time). And if somebody else wants to use the drill at the same time you need it, then you’re in for some negotiations and probably some irritation. And if the drill breaks or gets lost (or a “little screw head” gets misplaced), a whole new set of transaction costs kick in. And, don’t forget, your knuckleheaded neighbor never recharges the battery after he uses the drill, so you’re going to wedge yourself into the closet only to find that the drill is dead. More irritation. Transaction costs, in this context, might also be called pain-in-the-butt costs, and pain-in-the-butt costs don’t have to get very high before you say, “Screw it, I’m buying a drill.” You accept, even welcome, low levels of utilization in order to avoid onerous transaction costs. And, yes, you are being totally rational. Utilization is not everything. Read, as they say, the whole thing.\nJathan Sadowski and Karen Gregory have a really good piece in the Guardian asking \u0026ldquo;Is Uber\u0026rsquo;s ultimate goal the privatisation of city governance?\u0026rdquo; It is sparked by Uber\u0026rsquo;s experiments in shared rides, and schedule rides through fixed stops, in San Francisco. Some have argued that Uber is looking to privatize public transport, but Sadowski and Gregory think there is something else:\nthe company wants to be involved in city governance – fashioning the new administrative capacities of urban environments. Rather than follow government rules, like any other utility, Uber wants a visible hand in creating urban policy, determining how cities develop and grow, eventually making the city itself a platform for the proliferation of [“smart”, data-based systems](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/20/rise-of-data-death-of-politics-evgeny-morozov-algorithmic-regulation). FWIW I think they are on the right track: as cities become data-driven, city governments will increasingly be looking to new software systems to run them; but why should cities continue to be run by governments? Why not just outsource the whole thing to Silicon Valley, and specifically Uber, where the expertise in number crunching and algorithmic delivery lies? So long as we think in terms of a consumer model of citizenship where we consume services, rather than a democratic model in which we participate in the shaping of our cities, the prospect is dangerously tempting.\nFinally, Michelle Chen in The Nation tells us \u0026ldquo; This Is How Bad the Sharing Economy Is for Workers\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a thorough look at the labour issues around the \u0026ldquo;gig economy\u0026rdquo;, built around a new report by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) called \u0026ldquo;Rights on Demand\u0026rdquo;. Chen says the report is\nfocused on regulating the so-called “on-demand economy” of tech-driven gig employment, to put forward concrete policy models that can help restructure the “1099” contractor relationship to offer workers greater protection. One potential model is the statutory employee framework, under which contractors are for certain regulatory purposes considered workers, generally for tax laws. NELP notes that local and state policymakers can expand this structure to provide “portable” benefits by “directly requir[ing] that companies that use IRS-Form-1099 workers abide by labor standards such as the minimum wage and others, and pay into Social Security and state workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance funds.” She looks at the prospects for workers\u0026rsquo; rights in the sharing economy, and with a lot of links she points out some places where action is being taken to push back against the efforts of some sharing economy companies to push all the risk and uncertainty of their business onto the shoulders of their service providers.

It turns out that these efforts have fizzled, which is too bad.  Kessler starts off by looking back:\n\"How many of you own a power drill?\" Rachel Botsman, the author of the book _The Rise Of Collaborative Consumption_, asked the audience at [TedxSydney](http://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption?language=en) in 2010. Predictably, nearly everyone raised his or her hand. \"That power drill will be used around 12 to 15 minutes in its entire lifetime,\" Botsman continued with mock exasperation. \"It’s kind of ridiculous, isn’t it? Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.\" After pausing for a moment as the audience chuckled, she provided the obvious solution. \"Why don’t you rent the drill? Or rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it?\" The power drill became one of the touchstones of the sustainability vision of sharing:\nEven companies that weren't renting power drills proselytized the theory. \"There are 80 million power drills in America that are used an average of 13 minutes,\" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told the [_New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/friedman-welcome-to-the-sharing-economy.html) in a 2013 column about the sharing economy. \"Does everyone really need their own drill?\" But, Kessler reports:\nThere was just one problem. As Adam Berk, the founder of Neighborrow, puts it: \"Everything made sense except that nobody gives a shit. They go buy [a drill]. Or they just bang a screwdriver through the wall.\" Worth reading the whole thing.\nIn a similar vein, another Sarah (Lacy) reflected (Pando members only, now) on the failure of Homejoy and the difficulties that TaskRabbit and other home service offerings have had, and suggests that \u0026ldquo;the only Uber of anything is Uber\u0026rdquo;. Delivery companies too may have a hard time reproducing the Uber/Airbnb growth curve (right now I\u0026rsquo;m staying with my mother in the UK: supermarkets do their own deliveries and it works perfectly fine without any sprinklings of Silicon Valley magic dust). As she writes: the thing with Uber and Airbnb is that every time you want to get a ride or a place to stay, chances are it\u0026rsquo;s a different driver or a different host, so every time you use the service its ability to match you with a service provider is useful. For Homejoy, you really want the same cleaner every time, and for a supermarket delivery there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to have a different person every time either. The platform doesn\u0026rsquo;t add much value once you have found the right person.\nWhich makes me think a couple of things. First, it\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to challenge the idea of technological inevitability: sometimes technology-driven solutions work, sometimes they don\u0026rsquo;t. For all I try to be a perennial doubter, I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask hard enough questions about the utility of the underlying sharing model: I thought there must be something there and I just didn\u0026rsquo;t get it yet.\nSecond, the Internet is basically a communications medium, and communications is often not the main problem to be solved. Using power drills is not mainly about communications, it turns out it is mainly about convenience:\n\"For a drill, which by the way now costs $30, and you can get it on Amazon Now and have this thing delivered to you in an hour if you live in New York City—for something worth $30, is it really worth your time to trek potentially 25 minutes to go get something that you spent $15 to use for the day, and then have to trek back?\" In this case, the Internet doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve the convenience problem at all. Community sharing is still a worthwhile goal, but for many aspects of community sharing, the Internet does not add a lot.\n","date":1442395926,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"2ffba32708fd2a02517dbabdf0272068","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-case-of-the-power-drill/","publishdate":"2015-09-16T09:32:06Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-case-of-the-power-drill/","section":"post","summary":"The case of the power drill was one of the archetypes of the Sharing Economy.

I don't think there is a place that aggregates Sharing Economy events and commentary, so I'm going to try that for a while.  To start off, here are three interesting pieces. All links open in a new tab.\nThe indefatigable Ellen Huet highlights Uber\u0026rsquo;s continual efforts to raise its take of each ride: it has now raised its commission to 25% in five more cities.\nIn the last few months, Uber has quietly bumped up commissions from 20% to 25% for new drivers in five cities. New York City drivers who joined as of April will pay 25%, as well as drivers in Toronto, Indianapolis, Boston and Worcester, Mass., who joined as of August, the company confirmed.   San Francisco drivers who joined in the last year still pay a 25% commission. An Uber spokeswoman declined to say whether the 30% commission pilot program has spread to more drivers or markets.   Keeping the higher commission to recent drivers doesn’t actually limit its impact very much. Uber’s workforce is constantly churning and growing: In January, an Uber-conducted study showed [a quarter of its active drivers had joined in the last month](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/01/22/uber-study-workforce/). It’s unclear if raising the commission deters new drivers from signing up, but if the policy has spread from its first test city, it suggests it makes economic sense. The churn among Uber\u0026rsquo;s drivers matches that in Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s hosts: new people try it out, and a lot decide it\u0026rsquo;s not for them. You would think that the more Uber takes from each ride, the weaker its claims that it is not responsible (just a technology company) when things go wrong, but it looks like they are confident they can take more money without taking on more risk.\nIlya Marritz in WNYC news reports on city inspectors chasing down potential illegal rentals:\nWNYC has obtained detailed records from a year and a half of inspections. Here’s what we learned by reading through all 2,684 reports. ...from October 2013 through April 2015, the city received 1,616 complaints about illegal hotels. In the same period, inspectors made 2,684 visits looking for rentals that violate local laws While Airbnb is responsible for most, it surprises me how many reports are from non-Airbnb listings. In particular, Priceline has more than HomeAway.\nAirbnb - 101 Booking.com (owned by Priceline)– 40 Portobello Suites – 11 VRBO (owned by HomeAway)– 11 Homeaway.com – 10 Tripadvisor - 5 Agoda (owned by Priceline)– 3 Expedia – 3 I do wish she had given us more of the report details, but there are some gems there, like this one:\n“Unidentified Woman Opened Door And After Saying She Did Not Live There Attempted To Slam Door On Identified Police Officer.

His form of opposition is to create free/libre software, but that is no solution.  Stallman confronts his readers: \u0026ldquo;Should you trust an internet of proprietary software things? Don’t be an ass.\u0026rdquo; He claims that \u0026ldquo;proprietary software is computing for suckers\u0026rdquo; and that proprietary software is a virtual synonym for malware. Of course proprietary software can be used and is being used to snoop on users, to shackle users, and to report data to companies. But so is free/libre software. Free/libre is not a magic talisman that protects you from all these harms. An internet of open source software things could be just as intrusive as an internet of proprietary software things.\nStallman writes: \u0026ldquo;What kinds of programs constitute malware? Operating systems, first of all. Windows snoops on users, shackles users and, on mobiles, censors apps; it also has a universal back door that allows Microsoft to remotely impose software changes.\u0026ldquo; So what about the free/libre alternative Linux, which apparently he wrote (\u0026ldquo;I developed the GNU operating system, which is often called Linux\u0026rdquo;), probably right after he \u0026ldquo;started free software in the 80s\u0026rdquo;. My Android phone runs Linux, and it spies on me. And all those NSA computers used for spying? They run on Linux. The biggest corporate contributor to Linux is Intel: is Intel morally better than Microsoft as a result of its contributions? (hint: No)\nOr what about the databases used to actually store all that snooping information. The Acculumo database that the NSA developed specifically for the purpose and which is now kindly supported by the Apache Foundation; the Hadoop distributed file system that underlies Accumulo; the Java programming language used to write Hadoop and Accumulo? All open source.\nIn short, free/libre software is no longer an alternative to corporate and state snooping and shackling, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the problem.\nStallman avoids this conclusion by mixing up two separate things as if they are one. He calls on his readers to resist surveillance \u0026ldquo;by rejecting proprietary software and web services that snoop or track\u0026rdquo;. These are two different things. \u0026ldquo;Web services that snoop or track\u0026rdquo; can be and often are built on free/libre software.\nStallman also calls on his readers to resist surveillance \u0026ldquo;by organising to develop free/libre replacement systems and web services that don’t track who uses them\u0026rdquo;. But again this is mixing up two separate things. \u0026ldquo;Web services that don\u0026rsquo;t track who uses them\u0026rdquo; can be built on proprietary software just as easily as they can be built on free/libre software.\nStallman gets it right in his third call, to resist surveillance \u0026ldquo;by legislation to criminalise various sorts of malware practices\u0026rdquo;. The problem is one of practices, not free/libre vs proprietary software. I know some readers will say I am trying to blame the technology, but they will be wrong. And technology is not the answer either. Much as Stallman and others would like to believe that their practices of software development (free/libre versus proprietary) makes them rebellious hackers against an oppressive empire, freedom-loving opponents of surveillance, they do not.\n","date":1432309379,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"92bdfb8002c07eedbf6367c22b925648","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/stallman-on-openness-dont-be-an-ass/","publishdate":"2015-05-22T15:42:59Z","relpermalink":"/post/stallman-on-openness-dont-be-an-ass/","section":"post","summary":"In today's Guardian Richard Stallman [writes](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/22/malware-viruses-companies-preinstall) a call-to-arms against technological surveillance.

One has to wonder why.\nSo in their blog post here is what they say, and here are a few other questions they should answer and observations. I do hope people interested will talk to others who track what effect Airbnb has in their city, such as Share Better San Francisco.\nAirbnb Claim: The Airbnb community contributed nearly $469 million to the San Francisco economy last year.\nResponse: What is \u0026rdquo;contributed\u0026rdquo;? Does this mean \u0026ldquo;what visitors paid in rent\u0026rdquo;? or \u0026ldquo;what visitors spent while visiting\u0026rdquo; (and if so, how do they estimate it). Does \u0026rdquo;the Hilton Hotels community\u0026rdquo; contribute the total hotel income it makes from hotel rentals? They really should say what they mean.\nAirbnb Claim: The average Airbnb host earns $13,000 per year hosting – money they use to pay the bills and stay in San Francisco, and shop at businesses like yours.\nResponse: They say the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; Airbnb host, so I\u0026rsquo;m guessing this is the mean income, not the median. The mean will be more than most hosts earn, so the number is higher (better) than if they chose the median. (And if this is not what they are doing, why don\u0026rsquo;t they say?)\nAirbnb Claim: The Airbnb community supports 3,600 jobs at the local neighborhood businesses they patronize.\nResponse: supports? what does \u0026ldquo;supports\u0026rdquo; mean?\nAirbnb Claim:** 72% of Airbnb properties are outside of traditional hotel districts**, in neighborhoods that haven’t benefited from tourism in the past.\nResponse: This is what they always say to show how diverse they are. But looked at another way, my estimates show that over half of the total visits happen in just a few central San Francisco neighbourhoods (which have definitely \u0026lsquo;benefited from tourism in the past\u0026rsquo;, as shown here. Not quite as diverse as they claim.\n\nAirbnb Claim: The typical Airbnb property is booked about 6.5 nights per month, underscoring the point that these are people who are simply sharing space in the home in which they live.\nResponse: Note that they say \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo;, presumably meaning \u0026ldquo;median\u0026rdquo;, which will be lower than the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo;, so thay can emphasize the occasional nature of their hosts. It\u0026rsquo;s a slanted picture. Or, again, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t, why don\u0026rsquo;t they say so?\nThey could also point out that over 2\u0026frasl;3 of their income comes from people renting out whole homes:\n\nor that over a third of their business comes from people with multiple listings.\nBut of course they don\u0026rsquo;t.\n","date":1429565331,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"01e0d8c1d39575266dedb8e01b701f09","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/a-quick-note-on-airbnbs-san-francisco-report/","publishdate":"2015-04-20T21:28:51Z","relpermalink":"/post/a-quick-note-on-airbnbs-san-francisco-report/","section":"post","summary":"A bad-tempered post, for reasons that will become apparent.

Now I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to take a more complete look and can say a bit more.\nThere are two questions, of course. One is \u0026ldquo;What is happening?\u0026rdquo; What listings are being removed, whose are they, and what can we tell about those listings? The second question is \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the \u0026rdquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\nI ran a survey of Los Angeles in October 2014, and another over the last couple of days. Here are the main findings.\nThere is always a lot of flux in Airbnb listings, and much of that comes from people who give the service a try and then decide it\u0026rsquo;s not for them. But in Los Angeles there is something else. Here is a table showing the top hosts (by number of listings) from October 2014, and the number of listings they now have on the site. Table 1: The top hosts (by number of listings) in October 2014, and the number of listings they had then (2nd column) and have now (3rd) on Airbnb.

(If you have a booking at this listing I would make other plans.)\nSo why has Airbnb done this? They made their usual bland, substance-free comment to the LA Times: that the company\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;mission is to connect hosts with guests and provide a quality, local and authentic experience. We routinely review our platform for market quality and adherence to this mission.\u0026rdquo;\nQuality looks out: as a user to the site what you see is the rating of the listing, and many of the eliminated hosts have high average ratings. For example, the Urban Flat Team have had their listings removed but had an average rating of 4.85 (out of five), while the Venice Beach Hostel has a rating of only 3.90 (which is pretty crap) but is still on the site.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also nothing to do with the type of listing. Most of the top listers are listing out mainly \u0026ldquo;Entire home/apt\u0026rdquo; listings (as opposed to a private room in a house or a shared room) but then so does Prive Luxury Rentals and they have actually increased their number of listings from 16 to 21.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s left is the statement of the sales rep to the AE Hostel agency: that these listings are interfering (probably with no fault of their own) with Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s public image. The LA Times mentions the possibility of maneuvering in advance of an IPO, and this must be in the minds of some of the Airbnb executives. Also, the LAANE report from last month may be having an impact.\nMy guess is that Airbnb knows it has to look after its image as a peer-to-peer company, and that they are removing some of the most high profile professional partners from the site in preparation. So all well and good (although hardly fair on those partners), but is it sincere?\nProbably not. Here are a few facts that Airbnb will probably not publicise:\n In October 2014 there were 49 hosts with 10 or more listings in LA. Now there are 60.\n In October 2014, visits to Airbnb hosts in LA were split evenly between \u0026ldquo;single-lister\u0026rdquo; hosts and \u0026ldquo;multi-lister\u0026rdquo; hosts. Now the balance has tilted slightly towards multi-listers: their percentage has increased from 50% to 52%.\n In New York, where Airbnb previously had a clean-up of large listers, the number of hosts with 10 or more listings has increased from 19 to 46 between October 2014 and March of this year.\n  In short, the professionalization of the Airbnb business continues, and this looks like just an attempt to remove some of the more obvious commercial companies.\nCould it be something else? Of course it could, but if Airbnb wants to be taken seriously as a company that can regulate itself (and it really does) then it needs to come clean with the reasons for its actions rather than hiding between vacuous PR speak and turning, seemingly at random, on its partners.\n","date":1428210502,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"399fb6b0111c14855874f732f3a3ad1c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/whats-going-on-with-airbnb-in-la/","publishdate":"2015-04-05T05:08:22Z","relpermalink":"/post/whats-going-on-with-airbnb-in-la/","section":"post","summary":"Today's LA Times says \u0026quot;[Airbnb cuts ties with vacation-rental firms in Los Angeles](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-airbnb-rift-20150404-story.html)\u0026quot;.

It mixes data with thoughtful commentary with investigative work that could only be carried out by someone who knows the city. (I did contribute a bit of help in the data collection area, but had nothing to do with writing or the report itself.) Here are some highlights.   Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s report has this to say about its impact on neighbourhoods (in total):  Airbnb distributes economic impacts to neighborhoods that have not traditionally benefited from tourism spending. With Airbnb properties in more than 80 Los Angeles neighborhoods, Airbnb visitors are staying in and exploring places they might never have otherwise visited. The LAANE report shows that the Airbnb business is, in fact, concentrated on areas that are already heavily affected by tourism: while \u0026ldquo;AirBnB has units listed throughout Los Angeles, but just nine of the City’s 95 neighborhoods are responsible for generating 73 percent of the company’s revenue.\u0026rdquo; In tourist hotspot Venice, one in eight units are now Airbnb rentals.\n 1010 Wilshire is a high end apartment building with 227 units in Downtown Los Angeles; but 20% of its units are now listed as tourist accommodation on Airbnb.\n The host you see on the site, with a photo and personal note, may not actually be the host. \u0026ldquo;Danielle and Lexi\u0026rdquo; were two young women with \u0026ldquo;verified ID\u0026rdquo;, but it turns out that they are just a front for Ghc vacation property rentals.\n  And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more. Worth a read if you have any interest in the subject. The report has been picked up by the LA Times, Curbed LA, and more.\nElsewhere, Inside Airbnb has extended its beautiful maps to Portland. They have also collaborated with Willamette Week to chart the shape of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business in the city, and the results will be familiar to readers of this site: Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s story of being a site where \u0026ldquo;regular people occasionally rent the home in which they live\u0026rdquo; is misleading.\nThe real Airbnb story is gradually getting out there, of a site that uses the heartwarming stories of a few of its hosts to provide a cover for a growing cadre of professional renters using the site to avoid municipal regulations around safety (no fire inspections), zoning (driving gentrification of tourist areas), and taxes. It\u0026rsquo;s good to see diligent, talented people like LAANE and Inside Airbnb push the debate forward.\n","date":1426273283,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"53d549c74d0b60b00938f3db3cf5901e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/yesterday-in-airbnb/","publishdate":"2015-03-13T19:01:23Z","relpermalink":"/post/yesterday-in-airbnb/","section":"post","summary":"First, [this report](http://www.laane.org/airbnb-report) on Airbnb in Los Angeles, by the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE), is fantastic, especially compared to Airbnb's [own study](http://blog.airbnb.com/airbnbs-positive-impact-in-los-angeles-2) from December.

For example: while I live in Canada, my birth family lives in the UK, and while I was visiting them last year my sister and I got to take a trip to Rome for a few days. It was a great trip (we stayed in a rented apartment, in case you were wondering, but not rented through Airbnb), and one of our favourite parts of it was spending an afternoon in the Trastevere district. While Trastevere doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the big sights, it has many cobbled streets, charming restaurants, a beautiful square, and one of the oldest cathedrals in the city. It\u0026rsquo;s a more artisan, bohemian atmosphere than some of the other areas of the city, and that\u0026rsquo;s part of its appeal.\nSo like many other visitors we loved Trastevere, and like other tourists we brought money with us, and spent some of it there, so in a way our visit was good for the city too. But of course our presence is a mixed blessing: too much tourism can erode the very things that make Trastevere so atmospheric and special \u0026ndash; especially when those things are the \u0026rdquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; life of the locals \u0026ndash; raising the cost of living, and putting pressure on property prices. In the end, as tourists you have to hope that the city of Rome and the neighbourhood itself find ways to balance the various pressures acting on the place where they live.\nNot surprisingly, Trastevere does have conflicts over gentrification and the impact of tourism. Here\u0026rsquo;s a story from last September. In 1956 a cinema opened in Trastevere called Cinema America, and it was a feature of the area until it closed, sometime around 2000. In 2004 it was bought by a new set of owners who literally wanted to pave it and put up a parking lot, along with some apartments. There was local opposition to the plan, and stalemate until in November 2012 a group of young people occupied the cinema. By all accounts, they turned it into a focal point for the community and also attracted some big names of Italian cinema and the arts. In September 2014 the occupiers were evicted by the police, but they have apparently set up elsewhere in the neighbourhood and the campaign continues.\nWhat does all this have to do with Airbnb? Well, this\u0026hellip;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a map of the 8,000 Airbnb rentals in Rome as of last May, coloured by price (red is the most expensive, then yellow, green, blue and violet). You can see that the rentals are most dense and most expensive in the middle of the city.\nI use the number of reviews as a proxy for the number of visits, and so I can estimate which listings are the most valuable to Airbnb. Here is (by this estimate) the most valuable listing in Rome \u0026ndash; the one with perhaps the highest rental income of any in the city. It\u0026rsquo;s the red dot in the map below.\nIf you look just south of this place, you can see \u0026ldquo;Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere\u0026rdquo;. This listing is, you will not be surprised to know, right in Trastevere. So what kind of a place is it? Well, here is what it\u0026rsquo;s listing page looks like today (January 2015).\n\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful looking place, no doubt \u0026ndash; although not exactly cheap at $700 Canadian per night. The listing text says that it has been \u0026ldquo;Selected by the airbnb staff who stayed and filmed here for the upcoming airbnb hosting in Rome video\u0026rdquo; so its charms have been noticed by the company too.\nAirbnb, of course, says that its host \u0026ldquo;are regular people who occasionally rent out their homes and use the income they earn to pay the bills.\u0026rdquo; So who is the host for this particularly successful rental?\nWell, it turns out that Martin is not so much a regular Trastevere resident. In fact, he is a Harvard-educated tech entrepreneur from Austin Texas who is \u0026ldquo;rent[ing] out the places I bought with the proceeds from my last software company.\u0026rdquo; He is now CEO of Vreasy, a \u0026ldquo;novel software platform\u0026rdquo; which is \u0026ldquo;a growing force in the tourism and travel market.\u0026rdquo;\n\nMartin is listed as an Airbnb \u0026ldquo;superhost\u0026rdquo;. In addition to the Historic Nobleman\u0026rsquo;s Loft he has four other listings on the site - one more in Rome (an \u0026ldquo;Ultimate Panoramic Roman Penthouse\u0026rdquo;), two in Barcelona, and one \u0026ldquo;Seaplane cabin\u0026rdquo; that he will fly to any legal European lake so that you can use it as a hotel.\nNow I don\u0026rsquo;t know Martin and have made no effort to talk to him, because this is not really about Martin. It\u0026rsquo;s about Airbnb, and the gap between the sepia-tinted \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; they often talk about, and the reality of multiple-property owners. It\u0026rsquo;s the gap between their message of caring for neighbourhoods and the reality of gentrification driven by uncontrolled tourism, which they are playing a big part in accelerating. It\u0026rsquo;s the gap between their claim to care, and the reality of callous profiteering. Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s true business in Trastevere seems to be gentrification personified, and it\u0026rsquo;s exactly the kind of business that the locals of Trastevere are protesting.\n","date":1422760906,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"b6038ef4dfcac0246bf6876cb3a6f49b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/roman-holiday-airbnb-and-gentrification/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T03:21:46Z","relpermalink":"/post/roman-holiday-airbnb-and-gentrification/","section":"post","summary":"I'm a very lucky person.

There are all kinds of issues with the claim, but put them aside for the moment. Instead, here\u0026rsquo;s a question: assuming the claim to be true, what does Uber\u0026rsquo;s post tell us about the income of uberX drivers in cities other than New York and San Francisco?\nOne obvious thought is that it tells us nothing, because it only makes claims about NYC and SF. Another is that we could extrapolate from these numbers as if they were randomly chosen, and guess that the income in other cities is somewhere in a distribution centred around $82K. That\u0026rsquo;s what the Washington Post did by implicitly comparing the Uber numbers to a national average for taxi drivers:\n[Estimates](http://www.bls.gov/current/oes533041.htm) of the typical cab driver’s salary hover [around $30,000](http://www1.salary.com/Taxi-Driver-Salary.html). According to Uber, the median wage for an UberX driver working at least 40 hours a week in New York City is $90,766 a year. In San Francisco, the median wage for an UberX driver working at least 40 hours a week is $74,191. But Uber\u0026rsquo;s blog post actually tells us something different about driver income in other cities: it tells us that it is less than $74,000. How come? Simply because this is a blog post from Uber. Uber wants to make a compelling case to the media and to the public, so if drivers in Chicago or Los Angeles were making more money than those in NYC or SF they would have appeared in the post instead of those two cities. So we don\u0026rsquo;t know how much drivers elsewhere make, but we can be pretty sure that it\u0026rsquo;s less than $74,000.\nEpisode 2: Oct 2014 In October 2014, Uber published another blog post saying that drivers in New York City take an average of $36.16 per hour in fares, and make $25.17 per hour after Uber\u0026rsquo;s cut, but before expenses. (That\u0026rsquo;s about $50,000 per year for a 40-hour week, by the way.) What does this tell us about driver income in other cities? Again, it tells us that it\u0026rsquo;s probably less than $25 per hour because otherwise they would not choose New York City for their blog post.\nEpisode 3: January 2015 So last week Uber posted both a survey of its drivers and a report (PDF) by eminent economist Alan Krueger and Uber Head of Policy Research Jonathan Hall. The main things to come out of the report were that Uber is growing really quickly - impressive, but no surprise \u0026ndash; and that Uber drivers are paid better than taxi drivers. That conclusion comes from Table 6: The table confirms what I was saying above: earnings in New York City are 50% more than anywhere else apart from San Francisco, and San Francisco is the second highest earning city.\nAs several other commentators have pointed out (eg Ellen Huet at Forbes, Jacob Davidson at Time, Andrea Peterson at the Washington Post), the comparison between Uber \u0026ldquo;earnings per hour\u0026rdquo; and taxi \u0026ldquo;hourly wages\u0026rdquo; is apples and oranges, because the report has nothing to say about Uber driver expenses. Krueger and Hall have this to say in their defence:\nA detailed quantification of driver-partner costs and net after-tax earnings is a topic of future research. Nonetheless, the figures suggest that unless their after-tax costs average more than $6 per hour, the net hourly earnings of Uber’s driver-partners exceed the hourly wage of employed taxi drivers and chauffeurs, on average. (Oh Alan Krueger: you were given a set of data and \u0026ldquo;full discretion over the content of the report\u0026rdquo; but you come out with this? I\u0026rsquo;m not angry, I\u0026rsquo;m just disappointed.)\nSo what do we know about driver expenses? The Sound of Silence rule tells us that, if expenses made a good story for Uber, the company would have included expense data in the data set given to Krueger. In fact, if expenses made a good story, they would have been included in the earlier company posts as well. So we can be pretty sure that the expenses of drivers are $6/hour or more in most cities.\nIs $6/hour expenses reasonable? Certainly: the Washington Post\u0026rsquo;s Peterson notes that the IRS estimate of costs is 57.5 cents per mile, but that Uber don\u0026rsquo;t include distance driven in their report. Still, 12 miles an hour (including driving to pick up a fare and driving back to a good spot afterwards) is not implausible. And then there is the thorny question of commercial insurance, which would be an additional cost. It seems likely to me that Uber drivers are getting about the same as taxi drivers.\nEpisode 4: January 2015 Just to finish off, here is another sound of silence. Thanks to the efforts of Share Better, my data on Airbnb rentals got picked up in New York City last week when City Council held hearings about short term rentals. That data suggests that the percentage of illegal rentals in Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s New York listings has decreased only slightly since a year ago, and that the decrease has been swamped by an increase in the overall number of listings. There is not enough firm data on the Airbnb public web site to be absolutely solid on this, but that\u0026rsquo;s how things look.\nWhat did Airbnb have to say? Their response is that the data is \u0026ldquo;flawed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;inaccurate\u0026rdquo;, and that is literally the extent of what they have to say. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a joke. This piece in Mashable by Jessica Plautz includes Airbnb saying they don\u0026rsquo;t really know anything about their hosts, and Josh Dzieza in The Verge includes more of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s exchange with the council in which the company says, well, nothing. Airbnb executive David Hantman’s testimony \u0026rsquo;acknowledged that his company did not keep track of the number of users who are renting out their apartments illegally. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t research that,\u0026rdquo; he said during the hearing.\u0026rsquo;\nSometimes I wonder if I\u0026rsquo;m doing the right thing going after Airbnb, because there is a role for occasional casual short-term rentals. Maybe the company\u0026rsquo;s heart-on-its-sleeve attitude is for real? But then I realize that in the last year they could have put out realistic, convincing numbers at any time (and saved me a lot of work) but they haven\u0026rsquo;t. And like Uber\u0026rsquo;s silence on driver expenses, Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s silence speaks volumes: if the data were good for the company, they would have made them public. The fact that they haven\u0026rsquo;t (and their content-free responses to people trying to piece together a picture of reality) makes me more convinced than ever that they have things to hide.\n","date":1422236532,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"8928ad3c38e37be364ae10fd23f59989","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-sound-of-silence-or-what-uber-and-airbnbs-missing-data-tells-us/","publishdate":"2015-01-26T01:42:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-sound-of-silence-or-what-uber-and-airbnbs-missing-data-tells-us/","section":"post","summary":"Episode 1: May 2014 Last May, Uber wrote this in a blog post:\nMEDIAN UBERX SMALL BUSINESS INCOME PER YEAR: $90,766 (NYC); $74,191 (SF) UberX driver partners are small business entrepreneurs demonstrating across the country that being a driver is sustainable and profitable. For example, the median income on uberX is more than $90,000/year/driver in New York and more than $74,000/year/driver in San Francisco.

It\u0026rsquo;s a book that takes on new importance in the light of the CIA torture report.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you won\u0026rsquo;t have thought about the anthrax attacks in some time. Remember: these were the letters containing spores of anthrax sent through the US mail to media companies and to selected politicians in the immediate aftermath of the 9\u0026frasl;11 attacks; letters that killed five people. During October 2001 there was a widespread belief that the letters were a follow-up to the 9\u0026frasl;11 planes, carried out by al-Qaeda with the help of Iraq, which was supposedly one of the few actors with the expertise and capacity to produce this biological weapon of mass destruction. That theory was disproved in late October and the FBI began hunting for a domestic \u0026ldquo;lone wolf\u0026rdquo;, initially pursuing one Steven Hatfill and then, when this avenue also proved to be a dead end, going silent. Six years later the FBI and the Department of Justice announced that they had a new suspect in Dr. Bruce Ivins, who worked on anthrax vaccines for the US army. Ivins died – said to be suicide – shortly before he was to be charged. In 2010 the Department of Justice closed the case, releasing a report that laid the blame at Ivins\u0026rsquo;s door.\nMacQueen\u0026rsquo;s book (I think of it as \u0026ldquo;Graeme\u0026rsquo;s book\u0026rdquo; of course, but for the sake of style I\u0026rsquo;ll call him \u0026ldquo;MacQueen\u0026rdquo; here). As I was saying, MacQueen\u0026rsquo;s book is brave because any attempt to question official stories of events surrounding 9\u0026frasl;11 get labelled as \u0026ldquo;conspiracy theories\u0026rdquo; which are, after all, taboo in polite society. Questioning of the official story of the anthrax attacks has been made to seem tantamount to a belief in the Illuminati and a conviction that the moon landings were faked, but MacQueen refuses to back away from the word. It\u0026rsquo;s to his credit that he puts the word \u0026ldquo;conspiracy\u0026rdquo; right there on the cover. And after all, as he says, it is nearly universally believed that the 9\u0026frasl;11 attacks were a conspiracy.\nIt should be uncontroversial to question the \u0026ldquo;official story\u0026rdquo; of the anthrax attacks. There was no trial, no opportunity for a defence by the man deemed guilty; the official story has not been tempered by the heat of public interrogation and debate. Released years after the events, the appetite for challenging the report has never been a strong one. In short, as official stories go, it\u0026rsquo;s not well established; its status is more like an arrest than a conviction.\nAnd people do conspire, MacQueen reminds us. To use the word need not imply a belief in all-powerful yet shadowy cabals, nor commit us to a conspiratorial view of history; the spectrum of possibilities is broad. Maybe it helps to think of a more distant case. The death of the Princes in the Tower during the Wars of the Roses remains something of a mystery, but most historians lay the blame at the feet of Richard III. Yet to say that \u0026ldquo;Richard did it\u0026rdquo; is just the beginning. There\u0026rsquo;s almost no chance that Richard actually carried out the execution with his own hands. So did he order it directly? Or did he utter an equivalent of the earlier Henry II\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\u0026rdquo; and let his councillors take their cue from his frustration? Or did the initiative come from elsewhere in his court, as someone lower down the hierarchy took history into their own hands? All of these are possible. There is a supply-and-demand aspect to political entrepreneurship and to responsibility for heinous acts. Creating the conditions that encourage and reward criminal actions is part of the tangle of blame.\nWe know that sending anthrax powder through the mail is not so far from confirmed practices of US military and intelligence agencies: Oliver North arranged for arms to be sold to Iran in order to pursue war in Nicaragua through contra proxies; the Gulf of Tonkin incident demonstrated the willingness of the US to deceive the public in order to justify a war. The use of agent provocateurs by official agencies is well established: many of the terrorist attacks supposedly prevented by anti-terrorist agencies were facilitated and encouraged by operatives of those same agencies as they try to establish their radical credentials in the communities they are infiltrating. Here in Canada, Mubin Shaikh was actively involved in setting up training camps that were then used to justify the arrest of the youths who attended them.\nAll of which is simply to say that there is a case to be made here, and one that should be well within the norms of acceptable debate.\nOne of the reasons I came into the book in a sceptical frame of mind was that there are no planning documents, no insiders giving compelling accounts of how the planning was done and where. Someone, I thought, would have come out and said something; or someone would have found and leaked some key document. But the report on CIA torture puts those doubts to one side: it shows that illegal actions can be carried on with the involvement of many inside people, that even though there would be tremendous demand for such material from the press no one leaked anything over the years since 2002, and that in the absence of the inquiry we would still not know (as a society) that these events had happened and that the CIA had organized them. So yes, secrets can be held for years.\nIn all this waffle I realize I\u0026rsquo;ve not actually said much about the book itself, so maybe I should summarize it at least. Here goes.\nMacQueen sets out his aims right at the beginning of the book. He\u0026rsquo;s out to show that the perpetrator of the anthrax attacks was not a \u0026ldquo;lone wolf\u0026rdquo;, that they were carried out by deep insiders in the US executive branch, that there were links to the 9\u0026frasl;11 Hijackers, that the goals of the attackers were to redefine the enemy of the west to the Global War on Terror and to weaken the rule of law internationally and within the US: goals that were successfully achieved. He convinces me of the first and of the final two. I\u0026rsquo;m not quite ready to follow him for sure with the second and third, but he makes a compelling case for both and I am convinced by him that insiders within the US executive branch have responsibility for these attacks, whether or not there was an explicit order to carry them out.\nThe focus of the book, as the subtitle says, is to make the case for a domestic conspiracy, and MacQueen starts with motive. In September and October 2001 there was a concerted effort to cast the events of 9\u0026frasl;11 as an act of war rather than just terrorism. Casting it as war was essential to passing the Patriot Act, to giving the President extraordinary powers, and to setting up military tribunals to try those seized. The case for war was made much stronger by the anthrax attacks, which clearly required capabilities the reach of non-state actors, and which were presented (during the crucial weeks of debate during October 2001) as clear evidence of conspiracy between al-Qaeda and Iraq. If Iraq was involved, then it\u0026rsquo;s an attack by a nation state, hence war.\nIn the lead-up to passing the Patriot Act on October 11, 2001, the Bush administration adopted a \u0026ldquo;strategy of tension\u0026rdquo;, building up the threat of an al-Qaeda/Iraq axis. Leahy and Daschle played leading roles in delaying the Patriot Act so that it did not pass by an administration deadline of October 5th and then, between October 6 and 9, letters were sent to both of them containing anthrax. Sure enough, on October 11 the act was passed. When it was signed into law on October 26, George Bush specifically invoked the anthrax attacks as a justification for curtailment of civil rights, in a chain of events that led straight to the now-exposed NSA surveillance practices. There is no doubt that the anthrax attacks gave the Bush administration exactly what it needed in order to achieve its legislative goals.\nThe central chapter of the book is an investigation of the four possibilities for the attacks: (domestic/foreign) (individual/group). The early focus was, as I\u0026rsquo;ve already said, on a \u0026ldquo;foreign group\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember just what happened at that time. On the basis of flimsy and ultimately false information, conjecture, and circumstantial evidence (at best), there was a major part of the US (and international) political and journalistic establishments who proclaimed, with sufficient certainty to invade countries and kill large numbers of people, that the verdict was in and the attacks were the responsibility of a \u0026ldquo;double perpetrator\u0026rdquo;: al-Qaeda and Iraq. It is at the very least inconsistent to dismiss those, like MacQueen, who suggest that a domestic group perpetrator was responsible when those who propagated and used the \u0026ldquo;double perpetrator\u0026rdquo; hypothesis continue to enjoy prestige and respect. The \u0026ldquo;conspiracy theorists\u0026rdquo; have a right to be taken seriously in this debate.\nThe double-perpetrator hypothesis gave way in the face of the revelation that the anthrax was weaponized and featured an aerosol additive that indicated it came from US military laboratories. A foreign individual was clearly out of the question, so that leaves two options. All efforts were devoted to tracking a domestic individual, first Steven Hatfill and then Bruce Ivins, efforts that concluded with the publishing of the Department of Justice report in 2010 and the closing of the case.\nThe main focus of the book is not to attack the case against Ivins, but MacQueen does highlight two events: the publishing of the National Academy of Science report in 2011 that said the physical evidence tying Ivins to the mailed spores was inconclusive, and researchers who published scientific papers showing that the spores could not have been prepared by an individual, and probably came from a lab other than the one where Ivins worked.\nI found this central chapter very strong. The case against Ivins is far from compelling, the absence of a trial is remarkable, and there has simply been no public attempt to assess guilt or innocence. MacQueen makes a very strong case that there is no obviously true official story, and that attempts to establish alternative theories are valid and should be taken seriously.\nI was less convinced by the following chapter, which is about advance knowledge of the attacks. Certainly there was much discussion of the possibility of anthrax attacks, and of dirty nuclear bombs, in the media during September 2001, after 9\u0026frasl;11 and before the actual anthrax attacks became public in October, but I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that such discussion necessarily derived \u0026ndash; as MacQueen suggests it does \u0026ndash;from the perpetrators of the attacks or that it showed foreknowledge or an attempt to prepare the ground for when the attacks actually happened.\nThat said, there is, again, a spectrum of possibilities. MacQueen\u0026rsquo;s claim that top officials used the chatter and amplified it at politically useful times and that the chatter was part of a conspiracy to justify war is convincing, as is his claim that the double perpetrator hypothesis was \u0026ldquo;false, known to be false, and flowed from repeated acts of deception by the US Government\u0026rdquo;.\nIf anything does make me consider the possibility of foreknowledge it\u0026rsquo;s MacQueen\u0026rsquo;s account of an exercise called Dark Winter, carried out at Andrews Airforce base on June 22-23 2001. The exercise simulated a biological warfare attack by terrorists in which anonymous letters containing smallpox virus are sent to media outlets. The simulation evolved in striking parallel to the actual events of September and October 2001. The participants in Dark Winter included Judith Miller (New York Times journalist who played an important role in promoting war on Iraq), James Woolsey (director of the CIA under the Clinton administration) and Jerome Hauer (a member of the neoconservative Committee on the Present Danger and also the director of the Office of Emergency Management of New York City until early 2000).\nWhat do these parallels tell us? They don\u0026rsquo;t prove that the team organizing the Dark Winter exercise carried out the anthrax attacks (and MacQueen doesn\u0026rsquo;t claim this), but they do tell us that there was a well-established script which gives the attacks meaning and purpose from a conservative point of view. They show that the people involved in Dark Winter, together with others in the Bush administration and in the conservative media, fostered a climate in which the anthrax attacks played a politically useful role, creating a context which encouraged a \u0026ldquo;false attack\u0026rdquo; by anyone who would want to see an attack on Iraq happen. Such an attack took place, and played the part required of it. Whether it was actually executed by a lone wolf or by a group is perhaps not the most important question.\nMacQueen is interested in the anthrax attacks for their own sake, but he is also interested in 9\u0026frasl;11, and he sees connections between the two. Robert Stevens, the first casualty of the anthrax attacks, was an employee of Mike Irish at Boca Raton newspaper The Sun and a friend of his wife, real-estate agent Gloria Irish. Gloria Irish found houses both for Stevens and, in the summer of 2001, for two of the 9\u0026frasl;11 hijackers (Marwan al-Shehhi and Hama al-Ghamdi). The official explanation for this is that it\u0026rsquo;s a coincidence. Beyond this, Hijacker Mohamed Atta made attempts to buy crop-dusting planes which made sense only for an anthrax attack (which al-Qaeda had, we now know, no capability to execute). It does seem likely that there was an attempt to tie the anthrax attacks to the 9\u0026frasl;11 attacks, and so to present al-Qaeda as likely anthrax attackers – but by whom? Bruce Ivins could not have known (MacQueen shows) of the connections between Stevens and the Hijackers.\nThe Bush administration undertook a wide range of deceptive actions – lying, making false implications and more – to present anthrax, al-Qaeda and Iraq as a powerful and threatening combination. These actions culminated in Colin Powell\u0026rsquo;s UN Security Council presentation at which he held up a vial of simulated anthrax. So just how far did they go? How much did they push, cajole, and encourage their organizations to produce evidence to back up the stands they were taking? And if they were putting a lot of pressure on their organizations to provide the proof of al-Qaeda/Iraq mendacity that they knew was out there, would it be surprising if a group somewhere undertook to provide the nudge that was needed, or took the pragmatic shortcut of just doing it themselves? Because surely, you can imagine them thinking, even if this attack was fake, it would be done with the best of motives, to draw attention to a greater danger that they knew was there in Baghdad. Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\nThe book gets, for me, at least 80% of the way to the author\u0026rsquo;s goals. He reminds us of the lengths to which powerful organizations go to achieve their aims. He reminds us that such organizations are not all-powerful, but make mistakes. He shows us that the constellations were aligned by the Bush administration in such a way that the anthrax attacks (by domestic actors supportive of the Bush administration goals) would be an understandable action. He shows us that there is a plausible connection between the perpetrators of the anthrax attacks and the 9\u0026frasl;11 Hijackers. If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t pull me the last mile to being convinced that the attacks were executed by people deep within the US executive branch I am a lot more open to the possibility than when I started. It\u0026rsquo;s a brave and necessary book and it matters that dissident voices such as his are demanding that questions continue to be asked about this important recent history.\n","date":1418965200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"2f20857669bd69148810429682c5ea23","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-2001-anthrax-deception/","publishdate":"2014-12-19T05:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-2001-anthrax-deception/","section":"post","summary":"I may be biased, but I believe my friend Graeme MacQueen has written a brave and important book in his newly-published \u0026ldquo;The 2001 Anthrax Deception\u0026rdquo;, which he subtitles \u0026ldquo;The case for a domestic conspiracy\u0026rdquo;.

If you want to print it off, here is a PDF._\nAn updated version of this page is maintained here, which you can access through the menu above.\nIn September, Uber introduced its UberX service in Toronto as part of a broad expansion across Canada (among other countries), and the City of Toronto is now seeking a court injunction to stop the company. Back in December 2012 the company was chased out of the city, but now some journalists, business professors, and even the mayor (not that one) think it\u0026rsquo;s time to disrupt the taxi industry, ignore the city licensing and standards process and let Uber run its taxi alternatives.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d think, reading these articles, that customer service is the only issue at stake here. But there\u0026rsquo;s more to it than that: the decision about Uber is also a decision about the kind of jobs we want to have, about accessibility, and about the kind of city in which we want to live. It\u0026rsquo;s about us as consumers, but also us as citizens, us as Canadians, and us as employees.\nUber is not \u0026ldquo;the future\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;a future\u0026rdquo; Contrary to the way some articles are written, we do have a choice here. A lot of the links above talk as if Uber were some kind of inevitable future (\u0026ldquo;The Ubers are destined to win the taxi wars\u0026rdquo;); here is an example from Todd Hirsch:\nIt's an economic tale told time and again. Camera film makers. Video stores. The music recording industry. Perhaps most famously, the Luddites – those textile labourers in 19th century England who protested against the introduction of mechanized looms by smashing them. Many of them failed to adapt to new, disruptive technologies and went extinct. Next on the list may be the taxi industry… Conflating Uber with the broad advance of technology is just wrong, and it\u0026rsquo;s also exactly what Uber wants us to do. After all, if you\u0026rsquo;re the future, who can argue against that? But thousands of new technology businesses start every year, and many of them fail. Groupon turned out not to be the future of shopping. Mayor John Tory wants to \u0026ldquo;sit down with the Ubers and the Hailos and others of the world\u0026rdquo;, but Hailo has already folded its North American operations. Paris has turned down UberPop, but it has Autolib\u0026rsquo;, which may be the world\u0026rsquo;s most successful electric-car sharing program. There are many roads to the future—many innovative roads to the future—and the best of them don\u0026rsquo;t involve Uber.\nThe Uber controversy is not just—or even mainly—a technology story, it\u0026rsquo;s fundamentally a deregulation story; the story of a uniquely American fundamentalist free-market worldview being sold to us in the name of \u0026ldquo;car-sharing\u0026rdquo; and innovation.\nTwo cheers for regulation Uber CEO Travis Kalanick\u0026rsquo;s says that his company is engaged in something like an election race in which\nUber is the candidate and [its opponent] is an asshole called Taxi. I'm not totally comfortable with it but we have to bring out the truth of how evil Taxi is. Kalanick also referred to \u0026ldquo;Our opponent – the Big Taxi cartel\u0026rdquo; when he hired former Obama strategist David Plouffe to run its political lobbying efforts.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth reflecting for a moment on the fact that cities all around the world, with many different political and economic traditions, have decided independently that taxis need some regulation; and there is no \u0026ldquo;Big Taxi cartel\u0026rdquo; coordinating these decisions. Taxi firms are generally city-wide, at least until Uber itself came along.\nCities have had their own reasons for regulating taxis. As McGill University Law Professor Paul Stephen Dempsey wrote in a 1996 paper, regulations typically include:\n(1) limited entry (restricting the number of firms, and/or the ratio of taxis to population), usually under a standard of \"public convenience and necessity,\" [PC\u0026N] (2) just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory fares, (3) service standards (e.g., vehicular and driver safety standards, as well as a common carrier obligation of non-discriminatory service, 24-hour radio dispatch capability, and a minimum level of response time), and (4) financial responsibility standards (e.g., insurance). It is not a coincidence that, all around the world, taxi regulation happens at the city level rather than at a national or provincial level. Different cities have different needs. The one-size-fits-all model that Uber wants to roll out treats Tokyo the same as London the same as Windsor, but as Dempsey (see link above) writes:\nIn the final analysis, the suitability of taxicab service and pricing is a peculiarly local issue, best tailored by local governments based on their unique populations, spatial densities, road congestion, air pollution, and airport and hotel traffic. Meanwhile, for all its attempts to conjure up an underdog image, Uber has funding from (among others) Google, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and Goldman Sachs.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth remembering that taxi deregulation has been tried and failed in many places. For example, Seattle deregulated in 1979 but found that \u0026ldquo;service quality declined and rates were often higher\u0026rdquo;; and a 2004 US report noted that\n…several studies, including a 1993 Price Waterhouse study, found that overall, in many cities that deregulated, the supply of taxicabs increased, fares increased, service quality declined and there were more trip refusals, lower vehicle quality, and aggressive solicitation of customers resulting from a higher supply of taxicabs. So taxi regulation is imperfect, but the solution to that imperfection is not to walk away from it. Taxis are part of city infrastructure, like buildings, buses, and subways, and serve a valuable public service. Taxi regulation provides a way for the public and for our elected representatives to have a say in how the taxi industry works, so that (for example) Toronto can demand that the entire taxi fleet must be wheelchair accessible, rolling in over the next decade, or London can introduce a zero-emission Metrocab to address environmental concerns. The taxi industry may be a flawed part of our democratic institutions, but the solution to flawed democratic institutions is more and better democracy, not the American rejection of government and of democracy\u0026rsquo;s role in the economy.\nDespite claims of technological inevitability, saying No to Uber is perfectly compatible with innovation and forward thinking. If Canadian cities such as Toronto do say No to Uber, they would be joining cities around the world such as Berlin, Seoul, Madrid, and Paris in refusing to roll over and hand the responsibility for their taxi service to Silicon Valley.\nUber corporate culture Digital platforms are governed by network effects, which is why Uber\u0026rsquo;s massive funding rounds (having raised $1.5 Billion, they are now looking to raise another $1 Billion) and rapid global expansion are so important to the company\u0026rsquo;s future. They and their investors know it\u0026rsquo;s a winner-take-all game; that\u0026rsquo;s why Uber CEO Travis Kalanick admitted this month that he undermined the fund-raising efforts of his main competitor, Lyft. The decision facing Canadian cities is not about permitting a smartphone app, it\u0026rsquo;s about handing a large part of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s taxi service over to Uber.\nSo what kind of company is Uber, that people want to put aside taxi regulation and hand control over to them?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a company in the middle of controversy, as executive Emil Michael muses about digging up dirt on (female) journalists who criticize the company. It\u0026rsquo;s a company that spies on its customers using what it calls its \u0026ldquo;God View\u0026rdquo; of company data for party tricks or for blog posts. It\u0026rsquo;s a company whose top New York exec is being investigated internally for tracking a female journalist without her consent. It\u0026rsquo;s a company whose employees have warned another female journalist that \u0026ldquo;company higher-ups might access my rider logs\u0026rdquo;.\nI emphasize \u0026ldquo;female journalist\u0026rdquo; here because the culture of the company is a big part of the problem. Do we want to hand over Toronto streets to a company whose CEO wisecracks about women on demand (\u0026rdquo;Yeah, we call that Boob-er\u0026rdquo;)? Which \u0026ldquo;can and does track one-night stands\u0026rdquo; and posts a blog entry about the data called \u0026ldquo;Rides of Glory\u0026rdquo; (now removed)? Which, more damagingly, ran a campaign in France (now also removed) called \u0026ldquo;Avions de Chasse\u0026rdquo; to pair Uber riders with \u0026ldquo;hot chick\u0026rdquo; drivers? As the company posted on the English version of its website:\n\"Avions de chasse\" is the French term for \"fighter jets\", but also the colloquial term to designate an incredibly hot chick. Lucky you! the world's most beautiful \"Avions\" are waiting for you on this app. Seat back, relax and let them take you on cloud 9! This is a company that responded to a complaint by a female customer that she was driven 20 miles out of her way to an abandoned lot by saying it was an inefficient route.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also a company that coaches Miami drivers how to circumvent laws. It\u0026rsquo;s a company that ordered and cancelled over 5,000 rides with its main competitor to interfere with their service. It\u0026rsquo;s a company that sets out to dupe newspapers with fake PR, and which now talks of \u0026ldquo;weaponizing facts\u0026rdquo; in its PR campaigns (this company really likes its military analogies). In short, it\u0026rsquo;s a company that reflects the worst of the macho culture of some parts of the technology industry.\nIn among all the privacy problems, it is worth noting that Uber has one privacy policy for the US, but has no Canadian privacy policy. That\u0026rsquo;s how much Uber is thinking, for all its massive funding base, about privacy issues for Canadian riders.\nDrive income: the Uber unicorn What really appeals to people who have used Uber (and I am not one of them) is the smooth efficiency of the service, an efficiency that relies on drivers to be in place, ready to take you where you want to go.\nAccording to Uber, efficiency and affordable pricing is combined with fantastic pay for drivers. In May 2014 the company posted a claim on its website that the median uberX annual income is $90,766 in New York City and $74,191 in San Francisco. The claim was hailed (hah!) by Matt McFarland of the Washington Post with the headline Uber\u0026rsquo;s remarkable growth could end the era of poorly paid cab drivers. Noting that \u0026ldquo;estimates of the typical cab driver\u0026rsquo;s salary hover around $30,000\u0026rdquo;, McFarland acknowledged that \u0026ldquo;Uber\u0026rsquo;s numbers don\u0026rsquo;t account for the costs a driver incurs to own and operate a vehicle. Still, the gap in compensation for providing similar services is astounding\u0026rdquo;.\nThe claim is indeed astounding. How could Uber pay its drivers three times the pay of a taxi driver, charge riders less, and still be profitable? The initial explanation was that taxi medallion owners in many cities suck all the money out of the taxi system (see financial journalist Felix Salmon here and here for example).\nI took a look at the claim when it was made and compared Uber\u0026rsquo;s estimates to taxi reports from three different cities. It was clear that Uber was taking out about the same percentage of each dollar of fare from the system as do medallion owners (20% of the fare at the time, plus a $1 \u0026ldquo;safety fee\u0026rdquo; per ride), so there was no magic there after all. The company admitted that it was looking only at drivers who logged over 40 hours a week which, given that most drivers are working longer than they are actually \u0026ldquo;on the app\u0026rdquo; means that the average is highly selective of the top end of drivers. Finally, Uber massively underestimated the costs of gas, maintenance, insurance, and other expenses (such as tolls) that drivers incur (uberX drivers must drive their own cars).\nSince then, the claim has become less and less plausible. Felix Salmon toned down his praise here. Seattle Uber drivers protests in April and August, San Francisco drivers protested low income in May, Los Angeles drivers protested in September, New York drivers protested in September (Uber backtracked over new rules it had introduced) and again in October along with San Francisco and London. Low income has been a consistent complaint, including on the active Uber driver forum UberPeople and at Reddit. Reports from individual Uber drivers failed to come near to the income figures that Uber claimed (for example this report from Fort Worth (strong language!) or this report or this report from Boston).\nMeanwhile, Uber has been taking a bigger and bigger slice of the consumer dollar. The $1 per trip \u0026ldquo;safety fee\u0026rdquo; was a start, then they started charging drivers $10 per week for use of a smartphone, and more recently they increased their commission for new drivers in San Francisco to 25% of the fare.\nFinally, multiple rounds of fare cuts have put pressure on driver income. Uber insists that a greater number of rides per driver makes up for the price cuts, but drivers themselves dispute this claim and there are few numbers from Uber to back it up.\nThe $90,000 claims have been re-investigated in recent weeks by two of the most consistently informative journalists covering Uber. Johana Bhuiyan of Buzzfeed looked at eleven Uber drivers\u0026rsquo;s pay slips here; and Slate\u0026rsquo;s Alison Griswold called the $90,000 driver Uber\u0026rsquo;s Unicorn, saying \u0026ldquo;In several months of reporting on Uber, I have yet to come across a single driver earning the equivalent of $90,766 a year.\u0026rdquo; She asked Uber\u0026rsquo;s Lane Kasselman to introduce her to one and concludes: \u0026ldquo;Last I heard, they’re still looking.\u0026rdquo; Meanwhile, the New York Post concludes that \u0026ldquo;their take-home pay is closer to the average that yellow cabbies make.\u0026rdquo;\nRating systems and vulnerable drivers Money is, of course, one of the main points of contention for many jobs, but Uber is not just another employer. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s not an employer at all: Uber drivers are \u0026ldquo;partners\u0026rdquo;, self-employed entrepreneurs who choose to work on the platform. The model of \u0026ldquo;micro-entrepreneurs\u0026rdquo; who can choose when to work independently is what makes Uber part of the booming \u0026ldquo;sharing economy\u0026rdquo; along with others such as Airbnb. What seems at first like a light-weight and flexible model of work turns out, in Uber\u0026rsquo;s hands, to be another way for the company to have its cake and eat it too.\nUber claims its drivers are not employees, but has been exerting more and more control over their behaviour.\nUber makes it easy for new drivers to join up: it publicizes what many drivers describe as unrealistic earnings to attract interest (see above) and encourages drivers to take out what amount to subprime loans in order to buy a car. Then, of course, the driver has to put in long hours to pay off the purchase, and being kicked off the platform becomes even more of a threat.\nUber has taken advantage of the vulnerability of its drivers by imposing more and more strenuous rules. Driver acceptance rates (when the app assigns them to a customer) have to be up around 90% or you get a notification to \u0026ldquo;Please improve your acceptance rate if you want to continue to use the Uber platform\u0026rdquo;. Drivers claim to have been deactivated for being critical of the company on Twitter. Drivers on the premium Uber Black service (I have mainly ignored the complexity of the different Uber services here) were suddenly forced to take requests for the lower pay uberX service. The company tracks driver locations and complains if they are not to the company liking.\nBut at the heart of the control is the rating system that permits riders to rate drivers. Most riders give their drivers five stars out of five as a courtesy, but if a driver\u0026rsquo;s rating slips even slightly – below 4.7 in many cities – they can be \u0026ldquo;deactivated\u0026rdquo; or kicked off the platform. The system makes drivers vulnerable to the most demanding of riders, as a small number of complaints can lead to the driver losing their way of making a living. And of course there is no appeal, as the driver isn\u0026rsquo;t an employee and the contract is not a work contract. The reports of happy and friendly Uber drivers (see the Globe and Mail articles at the beginning of this post) take on a different meaning once you know the precariousness of Uber drivers\u0026rsquo; situation. As Forbes\u0026rsquo; Jeff Bercovici reported, \u0026ldquo;Uber likes this system because it enjoys being able to say all of its drivers have near-perfect ratings. But it\u0026rsquo;s a harsh one for drivers, and also for customers, who find themselves repeatedly forced to choose between guilt, spite and ignorance.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile Uber gets to dictate the behaviour of its drivers in more and more specific ways, it still takes none of the responsibility when things go wrong. Section 230 of the \u0026ldquo;Communications Decency Act\u0026rdquo; may seem like an odd law to protect the company, but here\u0026rsquo;s how it works. The law was initially introduced to say that blog sites and other user-content sites such as YouTube were not responsible for content posted by its users. Fair enough. But now Uber says it\u0026rsquo;s not a taxi company, it just runs a web site and an app, and puts drivers in touch with riders. Anything that goes wrong is not Uber\u0026rsquo;s responsibility, it\u0026rsquo;s the driver\u0026rsquo;s. The law is an American one, but challenging Uber is going to be expensive and maybe prohibitively so for Canadians too, especially given the company\u0026rsquo;s formidable bank account.\nUber\u0026rsquo;s rules seem to step over the line regarding whether a driver is, or is not, an employee according to Canada Revenue Agency rules. Sharing economy workers are facing this issue with other companies too, such as cleaning/odd-job service Handy. It\u0026rsquo;s an issue that other industries face, such as construction, and the root cause is always the same: classification as an independent contractor relieves the hiring company (Uber in this case) from having to pay EI premiums, and from having to abide by employment standards. The risk is pushed entirely onto the subcontractor. When Toronto mayor John Tory says that Uber should be allowed to operate, he\u0026rsquo;s implicitly approving of these arrangements, and allowing bad labour practices to intrude further and further into Canada\u0026rsquo;s workplaces. It\u0026rsquo;s bad for the drivers, and it\u0026rsquo;s bad for our society.\nCustomer issues Among all of these problems, the customer is the one who does well (putting aside the problems with sexism and privacy violation listed at the top of the post). Uber is keeping the prices low, pushing drivers to accept all the rides they are assigned whether or not it makes them money, and is using the rating system to ensure that the drivers put on a friendly face. It\u0026rsquo;s relying on these customers to push cities into permitting the apps.\nBut even here there are concerns: issues of race are complex: some people of colour report a dramatically better experience than with taxis but others are concerned about customer profiling, and potential for discrimination. Disability access is more troubling: blind riders are suing Uber and disability activists are filing lawsuits.\nSumming up This post is already too long. I could have written about the occasional horror stories of accidents and abusive behaviour from drivers, but they happen with taxis too. And I\u0026rsquo;ve not covered the dubious screening process that Uber uses, or the lack of proper mechanical inspection of the cars, or the difficulties with insurance: these have all been covered elsewhere.\nThe list of problems with Uber is long. The existing taxi industry is not perfect, especially in big cities, but it is a part of the democratic fabric of the country, and we need to address its problems by better democracy, not by throwing democratic accountability aside for the promise of self-regulation by an unaccountable company with an arrogant, sexist corporate culture, which treats its drivers badly, which walks away from its responsibility when things go wrong, and which is importing an American anti-democratic attitude into this country.\n","date":1416632400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"8d362def01f5205f61c279e772c32559","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/why-canada-should-de-activate-uber/","publishdate":"2014-11-22T05:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-canada-should-de-activate-uber/","section":"post","summary":"_A long post collecting together a number of arguments and resources about Uber and why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong in Canada.

Three days later the story was picked up by Mike Aidax in the Richmond Standard, and two days after that by Paolo Lucchesi of the San Francisco Chronicle. Then it went national, with appearances on CNN and CNBC. The most comprehensive account I\u0026rsquo;ve seen was by Cyrus Faravar in Ars Technica on September 21, which I\u0026rsquo;ll draw on again and again in what follows.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the beginning. It was five years ago that Davide Cerretini and Michele Massimo quit their jobs to set up a restaurant in a \u0026ldquo;worse location—a ghetto—and serve amazing food without expectation of customer service or tablecloths.\u0026rdquo; And they seem to have been true to their word, adopting a take-it-or-leave-it attitude to their customers: \u0026ldquo;I work 12 hours a day, six days a week. But if you come here to try to make us change whatever it is that is in our place, just shut up and go somewhere else.\u0026rdquo;\nSo \u0026ldquo;Botto Bistro serves all of its food at its order counter—there\u0026rsquo;s no table service—and crams 10 tables amidst giant flat-screen TVs\u0026rdquo; and their website FAQ is awesome, with gems like this:\n   Q. Do you serve pizza by the slice? A. No. Q. Why? A. Still no.    It sounds like something from Fawlty Towers, and you can imagine it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone, but Davide and Michele have built a clientele and are apparently doing fine.\nEnter Yelp So why the trouble with Yelp? Well, according to Cerretini, Yelp has been continually pestering the restaurant to advertise on the web site \u0026ldquo;30 times a week, sometimes five times a day\u0026rdquo;. This may be an exaggeration. Still, for six months, Botto Bistro did advertise. Then they cancelled their ads but Yelp kept calling. \u0026ldquo;I insulted them and I called them bad names\u0026rdquo;, says Cerretini, \u0026ldquo;Yelp asked us to pay them as advertising so they can criticize me better.\u0026rdquo;\nIn frustration, the Botto Bistro owners flung up their hands (metaphorically, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to stereotype Italians) and started their Hate us on Yelp campaign to become the worst-reviewed restaurant in the San Francisco area. Thirteen hundred reviews later, they proudly announced a one-star aggregate rating on Yelp, the lowest rating possible.1\nTheir Yelp page is a lot of fun. Some reviewers compete for the most outrageous complaint (\u0026ldquo;Their pizza ruined my marriage\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sitting here in my office in Hamburg/Germany and are in need of some food and learn that you are not able to deliver???\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;WORST place EVER!\u0026rdquo; and so on). Others are more obviously supportive (\u0026ldquo;Had this same idea when Yelp screwed over my business… just never went about doing it! Very glad to see it working out for you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Fuck you, Yelp. Long live Botto.\u0026rdquo;) Everyone is having a good time.\nBut Yelp has, stupidly enough, responded, as Faravar tells us. On September 15 \u0026ldquo;Marvin\u0026rdquo; from Yelp sent one of the co-owners an email that started this way:\nHi Davide, I 'm contacting you from the Yelp User Support Team because we've received complaints from the community that you may be offering incentives in exchange for reviews. To be clear, this violates our Terms of Service… After accusing Davide of violating Terms of Service to which he has not agreed, the email goes on to threaten \u0026ldquo;a Consumer Alert being placed on your listing\u0026rdquo;.\nSo three cheers for Botto Bistro. Its campaign is many things: it\u0026rsquo;s a gimmick, a gesture of frustration, a declaration of individuality and quirkiness, and an act of rebellion against the creeping tyranny of a world defined by software and Terms of Service.\nBut the campaign relies on novelty for its success, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a tactic that can be easily reproduced by others. What, then, can other restaurants do if they are frustrated by Yelp? It\u0026rsquo;s clear that some resort to \u0026ldquo;fake reviews\u0026rdquo;, with less panache than Botto Bistro. It\u0026rsquo;s an act that\u0026rsquo;s widely seen as both ethically and legally wrong, but maybe there is a place for it…\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s wrong with fake reviews? We all know what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with fake reviews. Crowd-sourced sites such as Amazon\u0026rsquo;s book reviews, TripAdvisor\u0026rsquo;s hotel ratings, and Yelp\u0026rsquo;s restaurant recommendations, depend for their success on being the honest and authentic opinion of those who have read, stayed at, or eaten at the subject of their review. If restaurant owners reward people, or pay people, to submit positive reviews (sometimes people who have not even eaten at the restaurant) then those reviews are \u0026ldquo;frauds\u0026rdquo;: Yelp talks about \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;phony\u0026rdquo; reviews, and calls them \u0026ldquo;attempts to deceive consumers\u0026rdquo;.\nSome law enforcement agencies agree that paying for reviews qualifies legally as fraud: last year New York regulators carried out a sting operation that got \u0026ldquo;19 companies to cease their misleading practices and pay a total of $350,000 in penalties.\u0026rdquo;\n\"What we've found is even worse than old-fashioned false advertising,\" said Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general. \"When you look at a billboard, you can tell it's a paid advertisement – but on Yelp or Citysearch, you assume you're reading authentic consumer opinions, making this practice even more deceiving.\" The finding of \u0026ldquo;false advertising\u0026rdquo; was not based on whether the content of the reviews matched reality, but on the fact that the reviewers were posing as authentic customers, while actually being paid. But of course there is nothing unusual in a business paying somebody to speak positively about their offering. We\u0026rsquo;ve all seen television advertisements featuring celebrities who are paid large amounts of money to endorse a product or service.\nThe claim that it\u0026rsquo;s worse when it\u0026rsquo;s not on an obvious billboard is also outdated. We all know that TV and movie product placements are endorsements inserted precisely to seem natural – where you can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;tell it\u0026rsquo;s a paid advertisement\u0026rdquo; – by actors who may never have used the product they are endorsing. We\u0026rsquo;ve heard about \u0026ldquo;viral marketing\u0026rdquo; stunts in which people are paid to act as genuine enthusiasts for a product. This may be a bit sleazy, but it is also just business as usual.\nThere are many places where advertisement and \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; comment is getting mixed up. It\u0026rsquo;s of real concern where the venue is a public venue: the practice of drug companies promoting their own brand of painkillers in university lectures is an obvious one, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure you can think of more.\nBut why, at a time when ads and \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; comment mix in Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, is the Yelp reputation system off-limits as an advertising medium? Why is it \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; to pay people to say nice things about your business on Yelp\u0026rsquo;s review listings but not \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; to solicit endorsements on LinkedIn (tip: my LinkedIn profile is almost entirely fake), in the middle of a prime time television show? Why should Yelp reviews not be just another venue for marketing and promotional activities?\nYelp and restaurants: incentives Just as Google\u0026rsquo;s search results pages hold both paid-for advertising listings and \u0026ldquo;organic\u0026rdquo; listings, so Yelp\u0026rsquo;s pages contain both advertising and \u0026ldquo;real reviews by real people\u0026rdquo;. Yelp contends that the two are kept separate, but the potential for conflict of interest is obvious and some business owners believe that Yelp manipulates its listings to benefit businesses that advertise with them. And I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to that later.\nBut Botto Bistro\u0026rsquo;s frustration with Yelp is different. The owners are not interested in promoting themselves on the site. They want nothing to do with Yelp. The catch is, they can\u0026rsquo;t opt out.\nHere is one of Yelp\u0026rsquo;s Common Questions:\n**Can I have by business listing information removed from Yelp?** Consumers have the right to talk about what they like (and don't like) about a meal they ate, a plumber they hired, or a car wash they visited. We don’t remove business listings, so your best bet is to engage with your fans and critics alike, and hear what they have to say. (Aside: what a patronizing tone Yelp adopts as it tells business owners how to run their own enterprises, and how unsurprising that Yelp recommends actions that benefit—who else?—Yelp.)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a restaurant owner, Yelp wants three things from you. First, it wants reviews of your business in order to draw people to its site when they are looking for a place to eat. Second, they want to make money from you by selling you ad space. Third, they want to profit from the reviews of your business and your ads by striking partnerships with Microsoft, Yahoo, and maybe other search engine providers. It\u0026rsquo;s going to get two of those whether you like it or not.\nThe restaurant\u0026rsquo;s compulsory appearance on Yelp is both a promise and a threat. Yelp is the steward of the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s presentation on the site and paying Yelp is a way to improve that presentation. Regardless of whether Yelp actually manipulates its listings, there is an obvious conflict of interest in the roles.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s going to be compulsory for restaurants to appear on Yelp, then we have to ask questions about the company\u0026rsquo;s accountability before we judge those who pay for reviews or (even worse) charge them with fraud. And the picture is not pretty…\nWhile restaurants are held to strict standards when it comes to how they behave on Yelp, it turns out that Yelp itself is not accountable to the law at all. (I\u0026rsquo;ll look at American law here: if you\u0026rsquo;re a restaurant outside the US then holding Yelp accountable will be even more challenging).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s well known that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects web site owners from being responsible for user-provided content on their sites, even when that content is the source of profits. The protection extends to Yelp, according to a judge in 2011 and reaffirmed in September 2014. Yelp has no legal responsibility to verify any comments made by reviewers, for factual accuracy, reasonableness, or anything else. So if a restaurant complains that a reviewer\u0026rsquo;s opinion is not based on fact, that\u0026rsquo;s not Yelp\u0026rsquo;s problem. Opinions can be both \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; and wrong.\nBut of course Yelp does not just assemble user content, it also arranges it and presents it. Yelp\u0026rsquo;s sorting algorithms can make a big difference to a restaurant\u0026rsquo;s business: is the company bound to be fair in its presentation of restaurants? Business owners recently took Yelp to court claiming that the company \u0026ldquo;extorted advertising payments from them by manipulating reviews on its site\u0026rdquo;. A US Federal Appeals Court found that—whether or not Yelp is manipulating reviews—it can do what it wants.\n…even if small business owners could prove that Yelp manipulates their pages to persuade them to pay up for advertising, that doesn’t mean they are being extorted, or that Yelp is violating federal law… the law does not require Yelp to publish positive reviews in the first place, Judge Berzon wrote. \"By withholding the benefit of these positive reviews,\" the judge wrote, \"Yelp is withholding a benefit that Yelp makes possible and maintains. It has no obligation to do so, however.\" So Yelp is fundamentally unaccountable for the fairness of its reputation system.\nThe usual argument is that it is in Yelp\u0026rsquo;s own interest to maintain a trustworthy site—that market forces will keep it honest. But while it\u0026rsquo;s clear that a completely spam-filled site would lose its value, it is not clear that the optimal amount of \u0026ldquo;review fraud\u0026rdquo; from Yelp\u0026rsquo;s point of view is zero. Yelp is interested in volume as well as accuracy: it encourages participation by reviewers, restaurants, and users through a whole gamut of techniques. There is always going to be a balance between this encouragement and dissuasion of so-called \u0026ldquo;biased\u0026rdquo; reviewers. We cannot trust loosely-defined market forces to preserve fairness.\nYelp as a protection racket So Yelp is not accountable, but what about its actual history? Does it act as a steward or is it running a protection racket?\nIt is known that Yelp asks for and gets free services in exchange for reviews. Each year Yelp rewards some of its reviewers by anointing them part of the \u0026ldquo;Yelp Elite Squad\u0026rdquo;, and among the benefits are some \u0026ldquo;epic parties\u0026rdquo;. So who pays? Here is what Yelp\u0026rsquo;s official blog says:\nSometimes Yelp foots the bill directly for the venue, food or drink; oftentimes we look for sponsors to help defray those costs (e.g., Peroni Beer comped the beer I drank last week in New York). The venues themselves typically provide the space, some staff and sometimes food or drink. This arrangement is great for yelpers because we can visit a new place and meet each other affordably. And it works well for the venues and sponsors because they get exposure to a group of local adventurers who, if they like what they see, may become future customers. There\u0026rsquo;s a clear quid-pro-quo here: free stuff for reviews. Not that it\u0026rsquo;s explicit, but of course it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Ironically, Yelp understands how the implicit quid-pro-quo works when it comes to the small businesses being reviewed: here is an excerpt from Yelp\u0026rsquo;s advice pages for businesses:\n**Why does Yelp discourage businesses from asking for reviews?** Would-be customers might not trust you. Let's face it, most business owners are only going to ask for reviews from their happy customers, not the unhappy ones. Over time, these self-selected reviews create bias in the business listing – a bias that savvy consumers can smell from a mile away. No business is perfect, and it's impossible to please 100% of your customers 100% of the time. Business owners obviously feel the implicit promise when approached by Yelp. According to the Chicago Tribune, back in 2009 Chicago cupcake shop owner Patty Rothman was approached by a Yelp staffer who \u0026ldquo;walked into her Gold Coast shop and \u0026lsquo;guaranteed us good reviews on the site if we catered one of their parties for free\u0026rsquo;. Offended but resigned, Rothman complied. And just as promised, positive reviews bloomed for the business right after the party, Rothman said.\u0026rdquo;\nOr Doug Quint and Bryan Petroff of Big Gay Ice Cream in New York, which opened in 2011:\nAs Quint and Petroff explain, last summer before their New York City shop even opened its doors for the first time, they got an email from a so-called \"Elite\" Yelper that read, \"I am going to bring a team of other Elite Yelpers on an ice cream crawl and we want to come to your store. Can you open early?\" And then, in addition to asking the Big Gay Ice Cream guys to come up with special flavors just for them and sample-size portion of the whole menu, this Elite Yelper went in for the kill: \"Think of all the great reviews you'll get.\" ([link](http://www.eater.com/2012/11/28/6516145/extortionist-elite-yelpers-go-after-big-gay-ice-cream)) Beyond the solicitation of free services, accusations of the Yelp advertisement sales team employing protection racket tactics over the ratings posted on its site are widespread. Here are just a few:\nFrom the LA Times in August 2013, reporting on a town hall for business owners:\n…when the town hall opened up for Q\u0026A an hour and a half later, business owners were quick to vent their frustrations. Many slammed the company for allowing review posters to write inflammatory comments – one restaurant manager said she cried for three days after a Yelper said her restaurant was filled with Nazis, another said he'd received negative reviews from Yelpers who admitted they'd never tried the food – while others said they had been subjected to aggressive advertising calls from Yelp. \"I have one-star reviews for my diner from people that have never walked into the place. They've never stepped foot, they've never tried the food, but they give me one-star reviews. That's insane. Why would you let someone like that stay on the site?\" demanded Craig Martin, owner of Cafe 50s. \"I spoke to your office, I called your guys, I emailed, I talked to your salespeople.\" Another business owner, vintage clothing shop owner Reiko Roberts, said the advertising pressure amounted to extortion. She said that when she declined to buy ads, \"the lower reviews go to the top and the higher reviews go to the bottom.\" From a Reddit Ask Me Anything session with the CEO, here are two of many:\nMy anecdotal experience: I told the Yelp sales rep to get lost and to stop calling me after about 6 months of hounding. He finally relented… but guess what ALL of my positive reviews are now filtered. Up until that conversation, only about 25% of my reviews were filtered. Now EVERY SINGLE ONE. I sat in on a sales call with a Yelp rep, and after questioning her on the finer details we decided Yelp wasn't for us and told her so. She then became noticeably irritated and said \"Good luck getting any positive reviews in the future.\" And for more, you can look (where else), on Yelp\u0026rsquo;s page on Yelp, where it has a rating of 2.5 and 3105 one-star reviews.\nYou might wonder if these claims are true. Is it fair of me to post these allegations without checking into their accuracy?\nWell, one reason restaurant owners get angry at Yelp is that Yelp does not care whether factual claims made by reviews are true or verifiable: their rankings of businesses are based on opinion, regardless of veracity.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m happy to tell you that my sophisticated, but unfortunately proprietary, algorithms have identified all these reports of Yelp as honest opinions of the people involved. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you can find Yelp\u0026rsquo;s response to these allegations elsewhere, but they haven\u0026rsquo;t created an account here on Whimsley, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to post a link. What\u0026rsquo;s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see that a business owner has any ethical responsibility to maintain the integrity of a system that they feel is threatening their livelihood, is run like a protection racket, and which is unresponsive to their appeals. Seems to me like treating Yelp as a venue for marketing is a perfectly reasonable course of action.\nWhy trust reputation: bigger questions So that\u0026rsquo;s the point of the essay, but before I finish let\u0026rsquo;s explore another issue. Part of the problem is Yelp itself, but if Yelp were better, would there still be a case for fake reviews? Sometimes yes.\nThere are problems that come from the design of the reputation system itself, even if it\u0026rsquo;s run \u0026ldquo;fairly\u0026rdquo;.\nYelp aggregates user ratings to show an overall \u0026ldquo;score\u0026rdquo; for each restaurant and then it ranks the restaurants in order of this score; Yelp uses this \u0026ldquo;aggregate and rank\u0026rdquo; approach to decide which restaurants to highlight and which to regulate to the bottom of a list.\nYelp is proud of the influence of its model. When Cyrus Faravar asked Yelp\u0026rsquo;s vice president of corporate communications Vince Sollitto about Botto Bistro, Sollitto replied: \u0026ldquo;I think that you have to wonder if this is the smartest strategy—there\u0026rsquo;s a Harvard Business School study that was done showing that for every [star] increase, restaurants see an uplift in revenue between five and nine percent.\u0026rdquo;\nYelp would maintain that a good restaurant will get good ratings from its customers and so will benefit from the site, but the story is not so simple.\nWhile the net effects of reputation systems are complex and varied, there is a homogenizing, winner-take-all component that comes from this practice of ranking preferences and displaying them in order of average value. Yelp heavily favours those businesses that appear in the top few of the listings.\nYelp\u0026rsquo;s decision to rank based on average reviews favours restaurants with a broad appeal, and acts against more polarizing venues. It\u0026rsquo;s the same reason that many challenging or controversial movies that divide audiences (\u0026ldquo;cult movies\u0026rdquo; belong in this class) score lower on Rotten Tomatoes than those that are less divisive. Cult movies may attract a more intense following among their core audience, but there is nowhere in the Rotten Tomatoes system for such intensity to be reflected.\nLike a cult movie, Botto Bistro\u0026rsquo;s owners set out to deliver their own vision in an uncompromising fashion. Appeasing those who don\u0026rsquo;t like it is not high on their list of priorities. As they told Faravar: \u0026ldquo;We specifically, aggressively inform people that if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for customer service, this is the last place you should be.\u0026rdquo;\nThere is a place for many types of restaurant, including those with Botto\u0026rsquo;s take-it-or-leave-it style. But it\u0026rsquo;s clear why Botto Bistro will never get far on Yelp even if they wanted to: Yelp\u0026rsquo;s whole model of reputation works against the idiosyncratic and difficult.\nThe homogenizing force of \u0026ldquo;average and rank\u0026rdquo; systems may become more severe as whole industries seek to increase the role of digital ratings in our daily lives. There are many in the technology world who dream of reputation as currency: the idea that a numerical reputation score on one system (such as Yelp) should be portable to other environments (TripAdvisor? Credit Card companies? Landlords?) A good score on eBay may indicate a \u0026ldquo;good reputation\u0026rdquo; that you could parlay into a better interest rate on a bank loan. It\u0026rsquo;s already happening to some extent, as Airbnb posts the number of Facebook Friends of each host as evidence of their trustworthiness. This kind of naive scoring system is a terrible idea. The only thing worse would be a sophisticated scoring system.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s well known that early reviews can have a big effect on many ratings systems by \u0026ldquo;setting the tone\u0026rdquo; for reviews that follow. If you know that early reviewers have given a restaurant five stars but you are underwhelmed, you may give it three stars rather than two.\nThe aggregation process itself can also affect your business. A couple of years ago Rebecca Rosen reported in The Atlantic on a study by Michael Anderson and Jeremy Magruder: the researchers seized on the observation that two restaurants can have very similar average ratings (say 3.24 and 3.26) and yet when Yelp rounds them into half-star categories one will be rounded down to 3.0, while the other is rounded up to 3.5. Looking at 400 restaurants in the San Francisco area, they discovered that \u0026ldquo;moving from 3 to 3.5 stars is associated with being 21 percentage points more likely to have sold out all 7:00 PM tables and moving from 3.5 to 4 stars makes restaurants an additional 19 percentage points more likely to have sold out all tables.\u0026rdquo; That is, Yelp\u0026rsquo;s own choices about how to present ratings, independent of business \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo; reflected in its average rating had a significant effect on some businesses.\nIn short, the impact of almost any reputation system on a restaurant\u0026rsquo;s business is not just the natural effect of that business\u0026rsquo;s quality, but is also a result of the system designer\u0026rsquo;s choices, which cannot be influenced by the business owner. Business owners are dependent, to some extent, on the design choices of an unaccountable company for their success or failure. That\u0026rsquo;s not a pleasant position to be in and it\u0026rsquo;s made worse by the \u0026ldquo;winner-take-all\u0026rdquo; structure of many social media marketplaces. If a few fake reviews are needed to limit the impact of large reputation systems, that\u0026rsquo;s fine with me.\nThe philosophy of ratings Let\u0026rsquo;s finish up with what philosophers call \u0026ldquo;the question of meaning.\u0026rdquo; If we are to believe in a \u0026ldquo;fair reputation system\u0026rdquo; we have to ask: what, grasshopper, does a one-star (or a five-star) review really mean?\nYelp\u0026rsquo;s view (and TripAdvisor\u0026rsquo;s, and Netflix\u0026rsquo;s, and Amazon\u0026rsquo;s, and Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s, and eBay\u0026rsquo;s … you get the picture) is that a rating is an indication of individual preference, and that aggregating these preferences can be used to recommend the experience to others. If \u0026ldquo;reputation\u0026rdquo; is the social distillation of others\u0026rsquo; opinions about ourselves, then these rankings are a measure of \u0026ldquo;reputation\u0026rdquo;, distilled multiple times into a single number.\nBut just because that\u0026rsquo;s what the aggregators would like a rating to mean doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it so. There is a world of context behind each click that may not fit into any algorithm\u0026rsquo;s assumptions. In Botto Bistro\u0026rsquo;s case, a one-star review is a gesture of support, a way to thumb your nose at an impersonal system, and a quick path to cheap pizza. It\u0026rsquo;s a dramatic example of how one \u0026ldquo;one-star review\u0026rdquo; may have a completely different meaning from another \u0026ldquo;one-star review\u0026rdquo; even though they are recorded in Yelp\u0026rsquo;s systems in the same way.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to think that if only \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; reviews could be removed, then the remaining ones would indicate preference, but there\u0026rsquo;s little to back up such a claim. In other contexts (like eBay or Airbnb) a five-star review is more often a courtesy than a rating. Less dramatically, in the case of Netflix, one outcome of the Netflix prize was that reviews of one movie are heavily primed by what other movies we have recently reviewed (so that \u0026ldquo;objectivity\u0026rdquo; is tainted).\nAnd maybe a \u0026ldquo;fake review\u0026rdquo; should be seen as a commitment on the part of the restaurant owner, an investment in branding that indicates an intent to stay in the marketplace, a sign that the restaurant can, in fact, be trusted \u0026ndash; just like any other investment in branding.\nRatings do not always mean what data scientists would like them to mean. Human expressions are protean, and no attempt by Yelp or others to pin them down will succeed completely. There is something postmodern about ratings, just as any other human expression. We imbue them with meaning and intent outside of what the system wants, and there is no objective fact behind it all that is the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; rating. Il n\u0026rsquo;y a pas de hors-click.\nReputation is a multi-faceted, qualitative concept. It has been pushed through a meat-grinder by digital reputation systems and has come out the other side homogenized, devoid of texture, but easier to digest.

It\u0026rsquo;s interesting partly for what it doesn\u0026rsquo;t say, because as a city with a highly developed tourist industry, Barcelona is a sign of what is likely to be the pattern for Airbnb for the future. So, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick rundown on Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s usual economy with the truth.\nI actually found more hosts than the 4,000 that Airbnb claims: my recent scan of their site picked up 6442 hosts and 11284 listings. (part of a series of studies: here, here, and also here).\nAirbnb avoids its usual claim of \u0026ldquo;the overwhelming majority of Airbnb hosts in Sydney are ordinary residents who rent out the home they live in\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s just not true. 75% of hosts rent out a single listing, which is lower than in most other cities. And the majority of Airbnb listings come from people who are renting out more than a single offering, and I estimate that over 60% of Airbnb revenue comes from multiple listers.\nThe idea that Airbnb is made up of hosts sharing a part of their home also fails in Barcelona. 59% of listings are \u0026ldquo;whole home\u0026rdquo;, and these make up a whopping 81% of Airbnb revenue from the city.\nIn short, Barcelona is exactly the kind of place that needs to regulate tourism, in order to keep a balance between the income from tourists and preserving the city as a place to live, work (and visit). Airbnb is promoting its \u0026ldquo;home-sharing\u0026rdquo; story to justify its lack of interest in these regulations, but the story has even less truth to it than in New York and elsewhere.\n","date":1404784200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"2a8679d81784176da00d30e5cae81747","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/airbnb-in-barcelona/","publishdate":"2014-07-08T01:50:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/airbnb-in-barcelona/","section":"post","summary":"So Airbnb is in trouble in Barcelona ([Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/07/airbnb-fined-illegal-tourist-lets-barcelona-catalonia), [El Pais](http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/07/07/inenglish/1404733914_341057.html), [El Pais again](http://blogs.elpais.com/trans-iberian/2014/07/a-take-on-airbnb-in-barcelona.html)).

A few scattered thoughts.  I had a prejudice that this would be something of an inward looking conference, and was happy to be proved wrong. The range of perspectives was much broader than I expected, and while the core of the conference is the intersection of the internet with electoral politics and governance, the range of topics was broader than I expected too.\nWhich made the many references throughout to some loosely-defined \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; a bit odd. These were references from the stage and from organizers that implied a community around the internet and its use in (loosely progressive?) politics. This was the 11th PDF, a lot has changed over the last decade, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure there is such a \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; any more.\nThe highlight of Day 1 was the appearance by video of Edward Snowden, a year after the first published leaks. Snowden impressed. He came across as thoughtful, well-read, articulate, and modest, which is a compelling combination. He even looked bashful at the prolonged applause, which was winning. I wish I could say the same for John Perry Barlow, who was \u0026ldquo;in conversation\u0026rdquo; with him, but I can\u0026rsquo;t. Barlow kept dragging the conversation around to himself and kept prompting Snowden to agree with him - prompts that Snowden politely stepped around. Snowden\u0026rsquo;s main point was a simple one: that, whatever one thinks of states spying on each other (as in, the US spying on Angela Merkel for example), mass surveillance of entire populations is significantly different and crosses a pretty clear line into illegitimacy. In addition, it has not even proved to be useful for its stated goals of preventing terrorist attacks. Snowden may turn out to be as pivotal figure for our time as Daniel Ellsberg was for the Vietnam War era. The video is here.\nSome other selected personal highlights from the talks, with links where I can…\nThe theme for Day 1 was \u0026ldquo;Save the Internet\u0026rdquo;, focusing on the role of an open internet for political freedom. I found Katy Pearce\u0026rsquo;s talk on \u0026ldquo;How Authoritarian Regimes Take Advantage of Social Media\u0026rdquo; and Zeynep Tufekci\u0026rsquo;s talk on \u0026ldquo;Movements in a Connected Age: Better at Changing Minds, Worse at Changing Power?\u0026rdquo; both fascinating. Pearce has been looking at activism in the former Soviet states for years, and she paints a complex picture of the tensions and continuing changes as digital technologies morph and take on new roles in society. Tufekci returned from her native Turkey with interesting ideas about the difference between what is needed to spark sudden uprisings and what is needed to sustain a social movement or to achieve lasting political change. Demonstrations, she argued, act as a signal for a movement\u0026rsquo;s organizational capacity. When demonstrations happen more easily, governments may misread the organizational strength they imply–and perhaps this happened in Egypt in 2011–but such misreadings won\u0026rsquo;t persist.\nLater on, after my own panel session on the sharing economy was over (written up by Sam Roudman here, I felt it went pretty well but then I\u0026rsquo;m not the one to ask), more talks. Susan Crawford on the potential for municipal investment in \u0026ldquo;dark fibre\u0026rdquo; (ie, optical cables that are open for use) was all new to me – she writes about it here. Sue Gardner, now leaving Wikipedia, is an inspirational figure and her concerns about Building the Public Internet were compelling. You can find similar thoughts by her here from last year.\nDay 2\u0026rsquo;s theme was \u0026ldquo;The Internet Saves\u0026rdquo;, the idea being to focus on digital activities that used the Internet for good. The first morning session was great: Matthew Burton and Mike Bracken both talked about the importance of government service – a welcome change from the usual tech focus on entrepreneurship as the solution to social problems – and both delivered far more than they promised, which is the right way to go. If you have 17 minutes, do listen to Bracken: entertaining and novel. Bracken draws his language from Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly, speaking of \u0026ldquo;Government as a Platform\u0026rdquo;, but his conception differs from that of O\u0026rsquo;Reilly (does one write \u0026ldquo;O\u0026rsquo;Reilly\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;? that doesn\u0026rsquo;t look right). The bulk of the O\u0026rsquo;Reilly \u0026ldquo;Government as a Platform\u0026rdquo; talk is more accurately described as \u0026ldquo;Government as Data Source\u0026rdquo;: government provides the data, private industry uses it to build services. Bracken was talking about building a complete stack of services within the government, and to me that\u0026rsquo;s a different take on the topic, and one that is far more promising.\nBut then came Brad Smith, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s General Counsel, and the contrast could hardly be more stark. Lots of overblown rhetoric and ringing phrases but much less substance and little self-awareness. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say he sounded like a trial lawyer. And then much of the rest of the morning reflected the Omidyar Network\u0026rsquo;s approach to dealing with social issues by setting up businesses to deal with it, an approach I am not fond of. Omidyar Network is clearly doubling down: one short talk here was about HandUp, a startup that funnels donations to the homeless. Yes, a startup. So there was more for me to grumble about here, but again – that\u0026rsquo;s the point of a good conference, to hear different points of view.\nThe format for the whole program was talks of about 20 minutes with no questions (plus breakouts). It worked well: allowing Q\u0026amp;A would have slowed everything down, and a lot of positions got spelled out just by having the variety of presenters on stage.\nSo good job TechPresident, and thanks for the opportunity to take part.\n","date":1402685880,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1301ac182b13ce83882f7d438b873ef1","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/notes-from-personal-democracy-forum-2014/","publishdate":"2014-06-13T18:58:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/notes-from-personal-democracy-forum-2014/","section":"post","summary":"So I was lucky enough to be at the [Personal Democracy Forum](http://personaldemocracy.com/conferences/nyc/2014) at the beginning of June in New York.

The cities surveyed are:\n Paris and New York (Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s two biggest markets)\n San Francisco (the home of Airbnb)\n London, Rome, Berlin (three European capitals and major tourist cities)\n Toronto and Chicago (two smaller markets).\n  As in Part I, the surveys were carried out by a two-stage method:\n Stage 1 used the Airbnb search pages for a city to collect Room ID values (a number that uniquely identifies an individual listing).\n Stage 2 visited the listing page for each Room ID and collected information about it.\n  The data were stored in a database and the charts here are based on queries of that database. The survey code (and database) are available on github.\nThe main observations are:\n It is possible that the number of listings has reached a maximum in some of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s largest cities, particularly in the USA, while other cities do continue to show significant growth.\n There is a surprising amount of churn in Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business. Over a third of the listings on the site in November were no longer there in May, to be replaced by a similar (or, in some cases, greater) number of new listings.\n Around 90% of all ratings on the site are 4.5 stars or 5 stars (out of five).\n  These observations suggest some conclusions:\n Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s move to professionalize its host base may be a reaction to the churn in the host population, a necessary step to generate continued growth.\n In April Airbnb expelled 2,000 listings from its New York offerings, claiming that they did not offer a positive experience. Many of those listings must have had either no ratings at all or were rated highly (4.5 or 5) by their guests.\n The rating system does not provide a reliable assessment of host quality.\n  Churn Figure 1 shows the net change in the number of listings in each of the eight cities for which data was collected in both November and May, as a percentage of its November value.\nSome cities seem to have maxed out in terms of listings. Six of the cities saw either decreases or increases of less than 10% in the total number of listings. Each of the three US cities in the study lost listings between November and May, while Berlin and Rome were big gainers.\nFigure 1: Change in number of listings in cities.\nThe net gains or losses mask a bigger change. Figure 2 shows that in the six month period, well over a third of existing listings vanished from the site, and were replaced by a similar (or, in the case of Berlin and Rome, substantially greater) number of new listings. For both Paris and New York, well over 40% of listings vanished, only to be replaced by new ones. Figure 3 shows the total number of vanished and new listings.\nThe high churn rate must introduce uncertainty for Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s future, as it is relying on a steady stream of new listings to replace those that are vanishing from the site. Perhaps this is one of the motivators of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s efforts to professionalize its host base: hosts who make a commitment to the business being more likely to stick around.\nFigure 2: New and vanished listings between November 2013 and May 2014, as a percentage of the November number.\nFigure 3: absolute number of new and vanished listings\n[Note: I did wonder whether this high churn rate could be an artefact: whether the displayed room ID values could have changed between the November and May data collections. A query showed that, of the 10597 listings that occur in both the November and May collections from New York, 10529 have the same host. I concluded that room ID values are stable.]\nWe can look a little closer at those vanished listings. Figure 4 shows that the vanishing listings have fewer reviews than the overall population in the city.\nFigure 4: Mean number of reviews for vanished listings and for all listings\nFigure 5 shows the ratings that the vanished listings had received from guests. The overall distribution of ratings is investigated later in this report, but Figure 5 shows that, while many of the listings had no reviews at all (Airbnb recently claimed that reviews are left for 70% of visits, so it is likely that these listings had no visits either), of those that did have visits the average rating was overwhelmingly high (4.5–5).\nFigure 5: The number of vanished listings by average overall rating\nFigure 6 emphasizes the point, showing that the average rating of listings leaving the site is within 0.1 of those that stay on the site.\nFigure 6: Average rating of listings that leave the site (red) and which have been on the site for the whole period (green). Note that the y axis starts at 4.5.\nIt seems likely that many hosts try Airbnb, have a few guests (or none at all) and then simply decide that, for whatever reason, the service is not for them. To repeat the conclusion from the overall churn rate, the high turnover rate does raise questions about what long-term population of hosts the site can support, and how it can ensure that those who try and leave the site are replaced by new hosts.\nTrust Trust has long been a key part of the Airbnb business, and technology has been seen as the magic ingredient. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expresses the company\u0026rsquo;s confidence when he says of city-level rules that \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rsquo;re primarily set up for screening. To protect consumers. Well it turns out that cities can\u0026rsquo;t screen as well as technologies can screen. Companies have these magical things called reputation systems… We think government should exist as the place of last recourse.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are two sides to Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s trust system. There is peer-to-peer trust, often described as a reputation system, which consists of ratings, personal profiles, and comments written by hosts or guests and seen by other hosts or guests. The other side is centralized trust, which consists of central payment, verified ID, and a complaint system.\nMuch of the talk around the sharing economy focuses on reputation and peer-to-peer trust (as in Chesky\u0026rsquo;s comment above). That\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s the peer-to-peer aspect that is new: after all, in one sense we have forever trusted strangers to deliver services from food to haircuts to regular taxis, and the centralized component of the system is not that different to many hospitality companies. Jason Tanz writes in Wired that\nWe are entrusting complete strangers with our most valuable possessions, our personal experiences—and our very lives. In the process, we are entering a new era of Internet-enabled intimacy. So what do the numbers have to say about peer-to-peer trust?\nFigure 7 shows the distribution of ratings for each listing. Airbnb provides ratings under a number of categories (cleanliness, accuracy of description etc) and collects them together as \u0026ldquo;overall satisfaction\u0026rdquo;. The site does not give the ratings for individuals (although individual comments are visible) but provides an aggregate, from 0 to 5 stars with a half-star granularity.\nFigure 7: Overall satisfaction ratings for listings in each city. The ratings for 0-3 are so few that they are collected together. Listings with no ratings are excluded.\nThe vast majority of ratings are either 4.5 or 5 stars. The finding is consistent with ratings on other sites (e.g. an earlier look at BlaBlaCar, or more serious studies of eBay listed there). When we rate each other, ratings become more a courtesy than a judgment. Just as restaurant tips only weakly correspond to the quality of service, so a rating of 4.5 or 5 is more a way of politely concluding an exchange than it is of assessing the behaviour of a host or guest.\nThe ratings obviously fail to distinguish among the people on the site, and so are not providing the service for which they were intended. This is part of the reason why Airbnb and others have moved to emphasize the centralized trust aspect of their systems. But centralized trust is the same reason we trust the fast-food restaurant cook or the hotel cleaning staff. The major sharing economy sites rely on discipline and the potential for removal from the site to provide security for the users, just as traditional industries do.\nChurn and Trust in New York The Airbnb court case in New York raised the profile of the service there, and resulted in Airbnb ejecting 2,000 listings from its service.\nAirbnb claims that \u0026ldquo;we found that some property managers weren’t providing a quality, local experience to guests. These hosts weren’t making their neighborhood stronger and they weren’t delivering the kind of hospitality our guests expect and deserve. In some cases, they were making communities worse, not better.\u0026rdquo;\nWith 10,000 listings vanishing from Airbnb in the New York area, it is difficult to know which 2,000 were removed by Airbnb and which left for other reasons. Some individual hosts with large numbers of listings have been removed, but that still leaves many unaccounted for. Figure ny-vanished shows that, despite Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that the hosts are not \u0026ldquo;delivering the kind of hospitality our guests expect\u0026rdquo;, most of the removed listings must have had either no ratings at all, or must have had good ratings from their guests.\nFigure 8: The \u0026ldquo;overall satisfaction\u0026rdquo; ratings for listings in New York that vanished from the site between November 2013 and May 2014.\nThe biggest single category of the 10,000 New York listings that have vanished from the Airbnb site are listings with no ratings at all (shown as NULL). After that come the 5.0 and 4.5 ratings, leaving fewer than 800 with bad ratings (4 or lower). For at least 1200 of the listings that Airbnb removed, bad ratings is not the reason.\nCombined with the very high number of positive ratings shown in Figure 7, this result shows that the significance of peer-to-peer ratings is exaggerated for Airbnb. While the company proclaims that peer-to-peer rating systems set it apart from old-style methods, it is clear that their trust system is essentially a traditional complaint-based, centralized system. The peer-to-peer ratings may give warm feelings on the site, but Airbnb itself clearly does not trust it when it goes to remove listings from its site.\nConclusions The data set suggests that there is a surprising amount of churn in Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s hosts. Over a third of the host population in November left the site, to be replaced by new listings.\nIt is likely that a large number of people experiment with being Airbnb hosts, and then decide that it is not for them.\nIt will be interesting to see whether this becomes an issue for Airbnb as the number of ratings it has in the North American cities surveyed in November and May seems to have peaked. How will it continue the growth that is demanded of it by its backers in the face of the large number of hosts who drop off the platform?\nWhile much is made of the novel peer-to-peer nature of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s reputation system, it appears that the company runs a complaint-based trust system that is not so different from other hospitality companies. In April Airbnb expelled 2,000 listings from its New York offerings, claiming that they did not offer a positive experience, but many of those listings had either no ratings at all or were rated highly (4.5 or 5) by their guests: it appears that Airbnb did not use its own ratings when judging who to remove from its platform.\n","date":1402336380,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f23dcb5927c13e96f475c2f6bc97691d","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-shape-of-airbnbs-business-ii/","publishdate":"2014-06-09T17:53:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-shape-of-airbnbs-business-ii/","section":"post","summary":"Collecting data for several cities both in November 2013 and in May 2014 gives a look at some ways in which Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business is changing in these cities.

I don\u0026rsquo;t think their numbers add up, but first the story so far\u0026hellip;\nFor the notoriously cheap taxi industry, those are some pretty sweet numbers, and they were hailed (hah!) by Matt McFarland of the Washington Post with the headline Uber\u0026rsquo;s remarkable growth could end the era of poorly paid cab drivers. Noting that \u0026ldquo;estimates of the typical cab driver\u0026rsquo;s salary hover around $30,000\u0026rdquo;, McFarland acknowledged that \u0026ldquo;Uber\u0026rsquo;s numbers don\u0026rsquo;t account for the costs a driver incurs to own and operate a vehicle. Still, the gap in compensation for providing similar services is astounding\u0026rdquo;.\nAs the story spread, many just ignored those pesky costs. CNBC led with \u0026ldquo;Uber\u0026rsquo;s $90K salary could disrupt the taxi business\u0026rdquo;. The New Orleans Times-Picayune headlined its story \u0026ldquo;Uber drivers in New York City earn more than $90,000 a year, newspaper reports\u0026rdquo; and Entrepreneur.com claimed \u0026ldquo;The Median Income of an Uber Driver in NYC Is Nearly $100,000\u0026rdquo;. From the technology industry, CEO Mike Jones laid it out at Code Conference: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re qualified to drive a car, but not professionally doing it. Congratulations, boom, you\u0026rsquo;re making [a] $90,000-a-year average Uber salary.\u0026rdquo;\nAmong all this enthusiasm, a few voices did raise some questions. In Time Magazine Dan Kedmey emphasized the costs:\nUnfortunately, the figure excludes many of the costs of running a business, including gas, insurance, parking, maintenance and repairs and the original sale or lease price of the car which can take some hefty bites out of the driver's take home pay. It also measures a median income among a particularly dedicated set of drivers, logging a minimum of 40 hours a week and sometimes much longer hauls. He asked Uber, but they shrugged their shoulders.\nJust how much those costs eat away at a driver's take home wages is not easily gauged, according to Uber spokesman, Lane Kasselman. They can vary depending on the age of vehicle, the density of app users in the city, how many hours the driver puts in and what sort of customer ratings the driver receives. And for now that data, Kasselman says, is proprietary. At Mashable, Jason Abbruzzese asked whether the income is sustainable (Uber is looking to entice drivers and has deep pockets, after all), and at The Atlantic\u0026rsquo;s CityLab Eric Jaffe pointed to the Uber driver protest in San Francisco, where drivers claimed they \u0026ldquo;work for less than minimum wage\u0026rdquo; and asked how these stories could fit together.\nBack in December, economists Felix Salmon (here) and Tim Worstall (of Forbes) had both had fingered the culprit for taxi drivers\u0026rsquo; appalling incomes: the medallion system that many cities use means that medallion owners get to take the money. Now, in the wake of the new claims, Salmon asked Uber for details of these extra expenses and they actually sent him numbers (take that, Time Magazine!) showing that business expenses would be around $15K, so the drivers are still making twice the norm: not bad. Salmon deemed these numbers \u0026ldquo;reasonable and entirely intuitive\u0026rdquo;.\nUber, by the way, takes 20% of the fare, plus a $1 \u0026ldquo;safety fee\u0026rdquo;.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m no expert, but I thought I\u0026rsquo;d take a look at some reports into the taxi industry and see what I could find out about the Uber claims. The short version is this:\n The medallion owners in some cities take roughly the same amount of the fare as Uber. They may be ripping off the drivers, but the lease costs that they charge don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the main reason for the difference between the numbers. I think Salmon and Worstall have this wrong.\n The Uber claims over car maintenance costs are under what other reports say about the costs. I suspect they are cherry-picked, but they are also not the main reason for the difference.\n The big difference comes from the claim that an uberX car takes in $110,000 in fares over a year, while driving 40,000 miles. A regular taxi takes in about half that, and drives about 50% more. It\u0026rsquo;s not clear where this difference comes from (different cities? different ways of counting? bad guesses?) but if Uber is going to stick by its claim, it needs to explain the difference.\n The media writers who take business expenses as a minor factor in the driver\u0026rsquo;s overall income are way off.\n Put this all together, and the driver incomes look too high.\n  First let\u0026rsquo;s look at the plight of taxi drivers. I found relatively recent reports on the taxi industry in three major North American cities: a UCLA study on Los Angeles (2006), a San Diego State University report on San Diego (2012), and two reports about Toronto (2008, 2012). Obviously these are not San Francisco and New York, which is what Uber was writing about, but the point is not to ask if they are telling the exact truth, but to see if the picture they paint is a representative one.\nThe three reports paint a grim picture of a taxi driver\u0026rsquo;s life. In all three cities, most drivers work six 12-hour shifts a week for less than minimum wage, even after tips. These are mainly immigrant men, and most are between 30 and 50 so many have family responsibilities. Health insurance is non-existent, and the job is dangerous with assault, vomit (which they have to pay to get cleaned) and petty aggravations as perpetual companions. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone wants to paint a rosy picture of the taxi driver\u0026rsquo;s working conditions.\nBut now to the numbers. There is a surprising consistency to the three cities (which I write as LA, SD, and TO).\n In their 72 hours of driving each week, a driver will cover about 1200 miles (LA), of which just under half (LA) are \u0026ldquo;on the meter\u0026rdquo;. The LA study gives an average of 6.2 miles-per-paid-gallon.\n The total income (fares + tips) that comes into the cab over a week is about $1500 (LA), $1100 (SD), or $1150 (TO).\n Gas is a significant expense, and cab drivers have to pay it. The weekly cost is about $250 (LA), $260 (SD), and $250 (TO). This suggests that San Diego drivers cover the same distance as LA, while Toronto (where gas is more expensive) cover significantly less.\n Most taxi drivers pay a lease that covers car insurance and maintenance as well as earning money for the medallion owner. The weekly lease is about $500 (LA), $400 (SD), and $260 (TO). There\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit of variation in each city because there is a mixture of owner-operators, shift drivers, and others at work and their situations are all different.\n The Toronto report separates the car maintenance, depreciation, repair and insurance out. For LA and SD this will come out of the medallion owner\u0026rsquo;s income. It is about $300/week ($70 insurance, $70 maintenance and repairs, $175 on car financing).\n That leave a weekly income for the driver of about $600 (LA), $320 (SD), and $450 (TO). This comes to an annual income of $31,000 (LA), and a terrible $16,60 (SD) and $23,400 (TO).\n  We can put these in a table and compare them to the Uber estimates:\n[Update: changed these figures on June 3 to be better averages of the driver kinds in each city.] Quantity (weekly) LA SD TO Uber (est) \nFares + tips \n1500 \n1100 \n1150 \n2070    Gas \n250 \n260 \n250 \n115   Lease/Operator \n250 \n140 \n260 \n414   Car Operation \u0026amp; Depreciation \n300* \n300* \n300 \n76   Other expenses \n100 \n70 \n90 \n0   Driver Income \n600 \n330 \n250 \n1465     * = uses Toronto estimate, as no estimate given in report. Is paid by the lease-holder for those who lease.\nDo the Uber numbers make sense? At the very least they need some explaining before we take them seriously. Here are the questions that need answering:\n According to the Washington Post, Uber\u0026rsquo;s sample is \u0026ldquo;drivers working over 40 hours per week\u0026rdquo;. Are they working the same 72 hour weeks that taxi drivers are?\n Taxi mileage is way higher than Uber\u0026rsquo; estimate of 770 miles per week. Maybe Uber is not counting the \u0026ldquo;off meter\u0026rdquo; miles?\n Can they justify the low gas costs that they estimate or are they not counting time between rides (which is half the mileage for taxi drivers)?\n Uber seems to take more than the leaseholder (after expenses). Given the slagging off that medallion holders get, this surprised me.\n The car maintenance fee for Uber is much lower than for taxi drivers. Does this reflect a lower standard for Uber or where do they get this number?\n  In short, a lot of questions to be answered before Uber\u0026rsquo;s claims can be justified.\n","date":1401757680,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"94c8aa2c76c126590fb384d8c6148032","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/uber-drivers-earning-90kyear-more-evidence-needed/","publishdate":"2014-06-03T01:08:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/uber-drivers-earning-90kyear-more-evidence-needed/","section":"post","summary":"Last Tuesday taxi-disrupting tech company Uber posted on the company blog that \u0026ldquo;the median income on uberX is more than $90,000/year/driver in New York and more than $74,000/year/driver in San Francisco\u0026rdquo;.

More Evidence Needed\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["airbnb"],"content":" When Airbnb talks about its legal troubles in New York, Berlin, Amsterdam, and elsewhere, it claims that existing laws were never designed for its new brand of disruptive peer-to-peer business.\n Case 1: CEO Brian Chesky told The Wall Street Journal in January that:  There were laws created for businesses, and there were laws for people. What the sharing economy did was create a third category: people as businesses… They don't know whether to bucket our activity as person or a business.  Case 2: David Hantman wrote on the Airbnb public policy blog:  In 2010, the State of New York passed a law designed to crack down on bad actors that operate illegal hotels—a goal we all share. Unfortunately, the 2010 law also had the unintended consequence of impacting regular New Yorkers. There are more. You get the point.\nIn a series of studies designed to address regulators\u0026rsquo; concerns, Airbnb talks about its hosts as \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; and focuses on the ways its business is different to the existing tourist business. It highlights the hotel industry as a point of comparison and emphasizes just how different Airbnb is. Here are a few typical quotations:\n \u0026ldquo;87 percent of hosts rent the homes they live in\u0026rdquo; (Amsterdam)\n \u0026ldquo;87 percent of Airbnb hosts rent out the home they live in, and the typical host earns $7,530 per year\u0026rdquo; (in New York)\n \u0026ldquo;Airbnb is complementary to the existing tourism industry in Paris. 70 percent of Airbnb properties in Paris are located outside the central hotel corridor.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;73 percent of Airbnb properties in Amsterdam are located outside the eight central tourist districts.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s 5,600 local hosts are regular people who occasionally rent out their homes and use the income they earn to pay the bills.\u0026rdquo; (in Berlin)\n \u0026ldquo;About 80% of Airbnb hosts rent out the home they live in\u0026rdquo; (in London and Edinburgh)\n  There are more. You get the point.\nThe claim of novelty and of hosts as \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; has been widely accepted. For example, the thoughtful Kevin Roose wrote this in New York magazine the other day:\nThere are no laws governing Airbnb because until very recently, there was nothing like Airbnb in the world—not of the same scale, not with the same guiding philosophy. And when Airbnb came onto the scene, regulators were forced to slot it into existing categories where it, arguably, didn't belong—treating a bachelor renting out his spare room to make rent, for example, with the same rules as a scuzzy landlord operating an illegal hotel. They've been playing catch-up ever since. Or as Wired Magazine writes:\nWe are hopping into strangers' cars (Lyft, Sidecar, Uber), welcoming them into our spare rooms (Airbnb), dropping our dogs off at their houses (DogVacay, Rover), and eating food in their dining rooms (Feastly). There are more. You get the point.\nSo when it comes to thinking about and dealing with this and other sharing-economy companies, the kind of business that Airbnb operates matters. Does it match the company\u0026rsquo;s self-portrait? Is the company as novel as it claims to be? Are its hosts \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo;?\nIt turns out there is an element of wishful thinking in the portraits of Airbnb. Last November, I took a look at Airbnb data from New York (here and here). In February, travel web site Skift carried out a similar study (here and here), which was part of the New York Attorney General\u0026rsquo;s case against Airbnb. The two studies took similar approaches, collecting listings from Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s public web site and gleaning what we could from that imperfect data set. Both studies concluded that, while it is true that a large number of hosts rent the homes they live in, hosts with multiple listings make up almost half of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business. Also that, while Airbnb makes great play of its origins in renting out an airbed, such rentals are now a negligible portion of its business. Even \u0026ldquo;spare rooms\u0026rdquo; are a minority of the business: the majority of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business in New York comes from the rental of entire homes.\nThe data showed a company that was closer to orthodox models such as HomeAway and its subsidiary VRBO than the narrative would have it. There are differences—HomeAway is focused on vacation rentals, and many of its properties are run by property managers—but the similarities cast doubt on Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s claims that existing regulations are inapplicable.\nNow here we are: it\u0026rsquo;s six months on, and interest in Airbnb continues. Airbnb has kicked 2,000 New York listings off its site (10% of the total for the city). It handed over host data to the Attorney General (anonymized, the company says). Meanwhile, the company is valued at $10 billion, having raised $450 million in a new round of venture capital. The New York dispute is now over, but the sharing economy poster child is still here, bigger than ever, and still a leading light in the wave of digital disruptors looking to shake things up and make a lot of money.\nSo during May I collected data on over 90,000 hosts and 125,000 listings—about 20% of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s 600,000 total, according to this TechCrunch estimate—from 18 cities around the world, to sketch a portrait of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business. The main questions I had in mind are the straightforward ones, starting with the same ones Skift and I asked about New York:\n Is Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business based on \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; in a way that other part of the hospitality industry are not?\n Is Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business based on spare rooms and airbeds?\n I looked again at several cities I had collected (but not posted about) in November, so that I could look at how the business has changed in some of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s key markets.\n I hoped that looking a second time at New York might have something to say about the 2,000 listings that Airbnb removed from the site in April, during its run-in with the Attorney General.\n  For those who don\u0026rsquo;t want to read the whole thing, here are the quick answers.\n While a good part of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business is based on \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo;, over 40% comes from hosts with multiple listings. This is different from Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s self-portrait. Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s claim that existing regulations don\u0026rsquo;t apply to it is at least exaggerated.\n The majority of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s revenue comes from whole-home rentals. This makes the company much more like HomeAway and other vacation rental businesses. It casts further doubt on the company\u0026rsquo;s claim to be a new class of business.\n In some of its biggest markets, Airbnb may have maxed out the number of listings it can achieve. What\u0026rsquo;s more, there is a high rate of churn as individual hosts put a property on the market, have a few guests, and then take the property off again.\n Airbnb does not appear to believe its own claim that customer ratings provide an assurance of good experience. Airbnb says it removed 2,000 New York listings from the site because of bad experience, but at least half of those listings had good (4.5 or 5 star) average ratings from customers.\n  I\u0026rsquo;m going to post this in two parts.\n Part 1 looks at the split between hosts with a single listing and those with multiple listings, and it also looks at how far Airbnb has moved from its \u0026ldquo;origin myth\u0026rdquo;, after which the company is named—the hosting of people on couches and in shared rooms.\n Part II looks at the change in Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business over the last six months, including the changes in New York where the legal strife has been the loudest.\n If I have time and if there are requests, I\u0026rsquo;ll collect these three together and post a single PDF.\n  Background and Method Just to set out some basic information, Figure 1 shows the number of listings and of hosts in each city. The data was collected using a fairly straightforward two-stage search. The first stage goes through all the search pages for a specified city and collects the room_id values. The second stage visits the room page for each value and gets details about the listing. The code is available on github.\nA few notes:\n Airbnb has regularly said that is has about 20,000 listings in New York city. I find 19094 (and have over 20,000 from November) so the collection seems pretty complete.\n In 2013, Airbnb claimed 5600 hosts in Berlin. I find 6141.\n In the run-up to the World Cup, Airbnb claims to have 9,000 listings in Rio. I find just over 10,000. Perhaps the borders of the search are different, or the number is growing. Still, 90% accuracy is not bad.\n  In short, the surveys for each city seem pretty accurate.\nFigure 1: Number of hosts and listings in the surveyed cities\nThe host perspective Figure 2 shows the percentage of hosts in each city that have a single listing on the site. The values for New York and Amsterdam match Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s claim for New York and Amsterdam to within a percentage point, which suggests that the sample is realistic and that the use of a single listing is a pretty good proxy for \u0026ldquo;regular people who occasionally rent out the home in which they live\u0026rdquo;. The graph also shows that the claim applies to most of the big cities. Barcelona, Rome, and Tokyo are the only Airbnb locations surveyed that have fewer than 80% of hosts with a single listing. So far, so good for Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s self-portrait. From here on I will call hosts who have a single listing \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo;.\nFigure 2: Percent of hosts with a single listing\nThe marketplace perspective Imagine that a city has 100 hosts, 99 are \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; with a single listing and one host has 99 listings, then the percent of hosts who are regular people would be 99%, but the percent of listings on the market that come from regular hosts would be only 50%. Both percentages are important in gauging the kind of business that Airbnb is. Figure 3 shows the percent of listings offered by regular people. The overall figure is 62%: still a significant majority, but a number that is 20% lower than the percentage of hosts.\nWe can see that for a few cities, notably Barcelona (11,000 listings) and Rome (growing quickly, at 8,000 listings), the majority of listings come from hosts with more than one offering.\nFigure 3: Percent of listings from hosts with a single listing\nThe traveller perspective The percentage of listings that come from different types of hosts corresponds to the experience of the potential guest browsing or searching the Airbnb site. The traffic generated by Airbnb is different, because not all listings are equally popular. There may be areas with many Airbnb listings but relatively few actual visits, while other areas may have listings that are visited very frequently. Airbnb does not give the number of actual bookings for each listing (or, nearly equivalently, the number of visits to the listing), but it does give the number of reviews that each listing has received, and this should be a reasonable proxy for the number of visits.\nOver a third of all listings have no reviews at all, and some have many (the most-reviewed listing in my sample is this San Francisco treehouse, a novel place to stay with 460 reviews.)\nFigure 4 shows the percentage of visits that are to rooms listed by regular people. The numbers are getting significantly smaller now. No city has more than three quarters of its visits at properties of regular people, and several have a slim majority of visits to hosts with multiple listings. Overall, 45% of visits happen at places offered by hosts with multiple listings.\nFigure 4: Percentage of visits (bookings) to listings offered by hosts with a single listing, using reviews as a proxy for visits\nThe Airbnb perspective There is one more step to take, which is to look at Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s actual revenue. What fraction of its business comes from regular people and what fraction comes from multiple listers?\nTo get here, I multiply the bookings (proxied by reviews) with the listed nightly price. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not a perfect measure but so long as regular hosts don\u0026rsquo;t overall have longer- or shorter-stay guests compared to other hosts, it should give a reasonable picture.\nFigure 5 shows the percentage of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s revenue that comes from regular cities. Only three cities have over 60% of their revenue coming from hosts with a single listing. Overall, 44% of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business comes from hosts with more than one listing, which is slightly up from 42% in November (the increase may not be significant).\nFigure 5: Estimated percentage of Airbnb revenue from hosts with single-listings\nAirbnb listing types The story of Airbnb emphasizes the casual \u0026ldquo;airbed\u0026rdquo; rental, but this is a very small part of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business. Again, there are a couple of ways of looking at the data.\nListings by room type Every listing on the Airbnb site is listed as one of three categories: a private room, a shared room, or an entire home/apartment. Figure 6 shows the breakdown in each city. It is clear that shared rooms are a negligible portion of the total: about 1 in 50 listings are shared rooms.\nFigure 6: Number of listings that are private rooms, entire homes or shared rooms\nVisits by room type Figure 7 shows the visits by room type, using reviews as a proxy for visits again. Shared rooms are an even smaller percentage of the whole: only 1.4% of Airbnb visits are made to shared rooms.\nFigure 7: Number of visits to private rooms, entire homes or shared rooms\nRevenue by room type Using reviews * price as a proxy, Figure 8 shows the percentage of revenue from each room type. The revenue that comes from spare couches and shared rooms is a mere 0.56%.\nFigure 8: Revenue from different types.\nSo what?  The data show that Airbnb is consistently economical with the truth when it describes its own business. It\u0026rsquo;s a long way from being just \u0026ldquo;regular people\u0026rdquo; and there is a lot more business coming from multiple-listing owners than they let on.\n The data say that it\u0026rsquo;s time commentators and the media stopped using the\u0026rdquo;Couchsurfing\u0026rdquo; narrative for Airbnb. At less than 1% of its business, the couchsurfing model is irrelevant for what Airbnb is today. It\u0026rsquo;s far more like HomeAway than it is like Couchsurfing.\n If there is a novelty to Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business, it\u0026rsquo;s that it collects property managers, individual renters, and occasional renters under one roof, just as Amazon can offer best sellers, midlist authors and self-published obscura in the same place.

I think it\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful book, but what I really want is to see more people disagree with it.\nThe trouble is, everyone seems to like The People\u0026rsquo;s Platform. In Canada, The National Post likes it and The Globe \u0026amp; Mail calls it \u0026ldquo;a No Logo for digital natives\u0026rdquo;. In the UK The Guardian says it is an \u0026ldquo;invaluable primer\u0026rdquo; for understanding our networked world, The Telegraph gives it four stars out of five, and The Financial Times is positive. In the US I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen reviews in the major papers except for The Boston Globe, which is persuaded by Taylor\u0026rsquo;s arguments; but on the left, Dissent and Tom Dispatch welcome it, while Kirkus Reviews calls it \u0026ldquo;a cogent and genuine argument for the true democratization of online culture\u0026rdquo;.\nThe thing is, the book is a challenge to those who see themselves as digital progressives, or part of a digital counterculture—the descendants of No Logo, perhaps, who would trace a disruptive, counter-cultural path from the anti-copyright campaigns of the 1990s through Free/Open Source Software to net neutrality campaigns, Creative Commons, Open Data, Pirate Parties, the Arab Spring, Occupy, and Anonymous.\nNot that we need to lump these all together of course, but there is a digital-progressive belief that the design of the Internet gives it a unique potential among technological innovations to be democratizing and liberating—and that (despite disenchantment with the advertising giants) this potential has been validated by the ways in which people have used digital technologies to challenge existing power structures.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;Sympathy for the Digital\u0026rdquo;, if you like: a willingness to give digital disruptions the benefit of the political doubt—to overlook the Wall Street connections of Bitcoin, or the ways in which open source institutions have aided the NSA\u0026rsquo;s spying activities—and a readiness to indulge today\u0026rsquo;s billionaires when they adopt the anti-corporate, counter-cultural language of the 1990s. It\u0026rsquo;s that feeling that the Pierre Omidyars of the world are somehow on \u0026ldquo;our\u0026rdquo; side because they come from the technology world. It\u0026rsquo;s the reason why the Electronic Frontier Foundation intervened on behalf of Airbnb against the State of New York. It\u0026rsquo;s where left-leaning people meet libertarians.\nTaylor\u0026rsquo;s sympathy for the digital has run out. It ran out, perhaps, when the documentary she spent two years of her life making was loaded up onto download sites and her requests for a short grace period were rejected because \u0026ldquo;philosophy is free\u0026rdquo;. The preciseness of our vocabulary tells us how we look at the world, and reducing cultural creativity to what Taylor calls \u0026ldquo;that flattening word, content\u0026rdquo; is a condemnation of the digital world\u0026rsquo;s indifference to artistic work.\nThe way she sees today\u0026rsquo;s digital landscape, \u0026ldquo;we are witnessing not a levelling of the cultural playing field, but a rearrangement… In the place of Hollywood moguls, for example, we now have Silicon Valley tycoons (or, more precisely, we have Hollywood moguls and Silicon Valley tycoons\u0026rdquo;. As we look at how the last 15 years have turned out, the big picture that Taylor paints is not one of egalitarian progress, but of a sort of Animal Network, in which the new rulers have taken on the manners and values of the old, while clinging to the rhetoric of rebellion and change to justify their actions.\nShe takes on a wide range of topics, including equality, openness, the challenges of sustaining creative labour, investigative reporting as a public good, the winner-take-all nature of Web 2.0 platforms, the value of limited copyright, the environmental impact of online culture, gender imbalance in the technology world, the implications of an advertising (and self-promotion) driven culture. She does so with a wide range of reading, and in an accessible style, in a voice that is intelligent and full of conviction. The book is not an academic book or a \u0026ldquo;big idea\u0026rdquo; book structured around a populist, easy-to-digest nugget. It\u0026rsquo;s an essay, in the best sense of that word.\nHer broad conclusion is that the digital world has not turned out the way that the enthusiasts and evangelists of the last two decades have claimed it would. In addition to predictable targets like Kevin Kelly, Jeff Jarvis, Don Tapscott and the more libertarian strands of Wired culture, Taylor takes on leading digital progressives such as Lawrence Lessig, Clay Shirky, Yochai Benkler, Steven Johnson, and Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly: people who would think of themselves as egalitarian. She places them, broadly, on the wrong side of current debates about the impact of new technologies on culture and society. The book suggests that it\u0026rsquo;s time these digital progressives engaged in some serious questioning of their own viewpoints; that they acknowledge that we live in different times now, and that the ideas and arguments of 1994, or even 2004, have different implications in 2014. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Taylor would do this, but I\u0026rsquo;d extend her argument to people like Biella Coleman, whose \u0026ldquo;Coding Freedom\u0026rdquo; is a smart example of digital counter-culture thinking, and to the kind of thinking that comes out of the Berkman Center.\nTaylor\u0026rsquo;s book is provocative partly because of her own background. As an independent film maker and Occupy activist, she has a history of frustration with mainstream media; in her own words, she is \u0026ldquo;a prime candidate… for cheering on the revolution that is purportedly being ushered in by the Internet\u0026rdquo; (p2). We all cluster in camps of one kind or another, and for digital progressives it is easy to argue that a book like Robert Levine\u0026rsquo;s /Free Ride: How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business, and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back/ comes from a place of entrenched interest and reaction. It is more difficult to paint Taylor as a digital conservative: this is criticism from inside the tent.\nThis is why I\u0026rsquo;m so disappointed that there has been no serious defence of digital progressivism in response to The People\u0026rsquo;s Platform. (Have I missed some? Please leave links if so.) The book deserves to spark a debate, but it takes two to tango, and the digital progressives seem to be sitting this dance out. (I would not expect the Kevin Kellys of the world to respond, but I had higher hopes of others).\nWhy the lack of retort? Could it be that Taylor does not have the profile to justify a response? That it is easier to ignore The People\u0026rsquo;s Platform and wait for it to go away? It certainly looks that way from here. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope I\u0026rsquo;m proved wrong.\nIn the absence of a strong response, it\u0026rsquo;s time to say that digital progressivism has no legitimate claim to the political or counter-cultural legacy of No Logo and the movement that book embodied. Sure, part of that political legacy was the anti-copyright campaigns of the early 2000s. Sure, digital initiatives like Indymedia came out of that movement. But that movement was also a protest against branding, and against the McDonaldization of global culture and the American cultural imperialism that accompanied it. For those of us outside the US, the right of individual countries to set their own rules to sustain their cultural industries and their cultures were part of the struggle. If that\u0026rsquo;s a struggle that runs counter to what some call the logic of the Internet, well so be it.\n","date":1399212420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"38add1ca82233354331e106c33618f8a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-peoples-platform-who-are-no-logos-children/","publishdate":"2014-05-04T14:07:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-peoples-platform-who-are-no-logos-children/","section":"post","summary":"Of all the books I\u0026rsquo;ve read about digital technology and its effects on our culture, Astra Taylor\u0026rsquo;s The People\u0026rsquo;s Platform is closest to my own beliefs.

There's been a flurry of revealing activity and statements, and lots of commentary. So here's more.  The court case is about many things. But what makes it interesting for those of us who don\u0026rsquo;t live in New York is the broader implications of the case, which include:\n The breadth of the Attorney General\u0026rsquo;s subpoena and the proportionality of his actions. Does the subpoena blend into the general fear of government access to individual data in the light of the NSA scandals?\n The illegality of some Airbnb rentals. If the subpoena succeeds and shows that a significant portion of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business is based on illegal rentals, then that\u0026rsquo;s a problem for a lot of people.\n If Airbnb rentals are illegal, who is responsible (legally and morally)? Is it the host or Airbnb itself?\n The validity of the law. Airbnb maintain the law is a bad law, inappropriately applied, and that the Airbnb hosts are a new class of business (\u0026ldquo;micro-entrepreneurs\u0026rdquo;) that need new rules. Does new technology render the old laws obsolete?\n How will this affect the $10B valuation of Airbnb and its prospects for an IPO?\n How will this affect the future of the sharing economy?\n  The main players are, obviously, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Airbnb. But other players appear on the stage, including:\n Airbnb hosts and guests. Hosts have the most to lose if their information is handed over.\n Democrat Senator Elizabeth Krueger. Her position on the issue (see here and today\u0026rsquo;s interview by Nancy Scola) is a bit different from that of the Attorney General, but she is broadly on the same side.\n The technology industries and advocates. The Internet Association and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have both spoken up about the subpoena, placing themselves broadly on the Airbnb side.\n Neighbours, landlords, tenants, and housing co-ops. These are all affected by individuals renting out apartments through Airbnb.\n The hotel industry. While Airbnb has painted hotels as one of the villains in the fight, their role seems to me peripheral.\n  To start with the narrowest issue: it seems pretty clear that about 2\u0026frasl;3 of Airbnb rentals in the city are outside the law in New York, which forbids apartment rentals of under 30 days if the owner is not present. The New York Post report is here, and is based on an affidavit by the Attorney General\u0026rsquo;s office (PDF). That affidavit is, in turn, based on an analysis of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s business carried out by consultants Connotate for travel site Skift. Their report is more extensive than, but similar to, the analysis I carried out a while ago here. Airbnb and Peers recognize this by arguing that the law needs to be changed.\nFor what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, I find Elizabeth Krueger\u0026rsquo;s position on illegal rentals more reasonable than either the Attorney General\u0026rsquo;s or that of advocacy group Peers. The Attorney General gives the impression of (at least potentially, and despite avowals otherwise) going after all the hosts who have made illegal rentals. Given that law enforcement is usually complaint-based and that Airbnb has done little to warn its hosts of their responsibilities, this seems harsh. Krueger (see links above) puts Airbnb as the root of the problem—making a lot of money off hosts and letting the hosts take all the risk—and I agree with her. Airbnb may not be legally responsible, but it seems to me morally culpable.\nBut what if the law is just a bad, obsolete law that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t apply to Airbnb hosts anyway, which is what Airbnb has been arguing? Here the onus switches to Airbnb: has it made the case that it can do better than New York\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;bad law\u0026rdquo;? It needs to do more than say \u0026ldquo;because Technology\u0026rdquo; if it\u0026rsquo;s going to justify a change.\nMost of the Airbnb case is made in its public policy blog posts (here and here), in its report on New York (here), and in its new sharing cities initiative (here). What these posts show is a remarkable lack of content, and a reliance on heartwarming words and spin that is, in the end, cheap talk.\nAirbnb\u0026rsquo;s description of its own hosts is at least consistent. They repeatedly describe their \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;regular New Yorkers who occasionally rent out their homes\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;regular New Yorkers just trying to make ends meet\u0026rdquo;. They emphasize that \u0026ldquo;87 percent of Airbnb hosts rent out the home they live in\u0026rdquo;. These are all phrases that invoke the \u0026ldquo;sharing economy\u0026rdquo; vision. When anything goes wrong, Airbnb refers to occasional, incredibly rare \u0026ldquo;bad apples\u0026rdquo;.\nBut Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s homespun language is carefully chosen. The 87% figure is the most obviously economical with the truth. It may be true as a percentage of hosts, but only about 63% of listings are single-listing hosts, and as much as anyone can tell, almost half of actual bookings are from hosts who have multiple listings. It\u0026rsquo;s not easy to get definitive answers from scraping the public web site, but Airbnb has consistently refused to challenge these numbers, and so it\u0026rsquo;s a good guess that they are not too far off the truth. They could release their own statistics if they chose, but they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nInstead, they put out \u0026ldquo;reports\u0026rdquo; that have no methodology, no definitions of key terms, and about 300 words of actual text. Airbnb makes a lot of the fact that it \u0026ldquo;supports more than 4,500 jobs\u0026rdquo; but it never says what \u0026ldquo;support\u0026rdquo; means. It claims to have \u0026ldquo;generated $104 million in economic activity outside of Manhattan\u0026rdquo;, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t say what \u0026ldquo;generated\u0026rdquo; means. This may seem like nit-picking, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t: it\u0026rsquo;s just asking for facts instead of spin.\nBut where things get really bad — for Airbnb hosts who drive the company\u0026rsquo;s revenue as well as for Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s claim to be a responsible provider of safe and well-managed accommodation — is in Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s slippery definition of its own \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo;.\nAirbnb continually claims to speak for its hosts, as in \u0026ldquo;our hosts want to pay taxes\u0026rdquo;, and repeatedly characterizes its community of \u0026ldquo;amazing\u0026rdquo; hosts as \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; people. It also describes them as \u0026ldquo;micro-entrepreneurs\u0026rdquo;, suggesting that they are independent. But Airbnb hosts, who are asked increasingly to invest in their own property in order to put it on Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s marketplace, are precariously dependent on Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s whims in order to make money from their investment, which is not an entrepreneurial role at all. If anything goes wrong, the host gets turfed off the market without appeal. If you\u0026rsquo;re a host, how do you know if you are a \u0026ldquo;bad apple\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;regular New Yorker\u0026rdquo;?\nMost dramatically, this has happened today. After insisting for months that concerns about multiple listings were exaggerated, Airbnb today permanently removed no fewer than 2,000 New York listings from its platform – roughly 10% of the total. They claim the process has been going on for months, and that it demonstrates their responsibility. But the fact that it happened today of all days, the fact that identifying multiple listings is a trivial exercise, and the fact that the criteria for expulsion are still woefully unclear, makes it difficult to take them seriously (Jason Clampet at Skift is excellent on the removals). Here is an excerpt of Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s explanation:\nBut when we examined our community in New York, we found that some property managers weren't providing a quality, local experience to guests. These hosts weren't making their neighborhood stronger and they weren't delivering the kind of hospitality our guests expect and deserve. In some cases, they were making communities worse, not better. We took a hard look at our community in New York to identify these hosts and we took action. Earlier this year, we began notifying these hosts that they and their more than 2,000 listings would be permanently removed from the Airbnb community. While we are allowing these hosts to support their existing bookings, all are now prohibited from accepting new reservations and if you search for a place to stay in New York, you won’t find these listings. Imagine you are an Airbnb host in New York reading these words. How would you know if you are living up to Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s requirements? Are you making your neighbourhood stronger? Are you delivering the kind of hospitality your guests expect? This is a \u0026ldquo;No True Scotsman\u0026rdquo; argument: the Airbnb community is trustworthy because if you do anything Airbnb decides is wrong then you are not part of the community. The lack of clarity is remarkable and shows that they are not ready to provide the kind of security and accountability that any replacement for rentals regulation would need.\nMy skepticism over Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s sincerity is heightened because, apparently, one blocking point in the negotiations with New York is that (according to Clampet), \u0026ldquo;Airbnb would not agree to limits on how many listings a person could have in New York City.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s clear that a large number of bookings is essential to the venture capital model, and goes against the spirit of the \u0026ldquo;sharing economy\u0026rdquo; that Airbnb so consistently invokes. But it looks like they\u0026rsquo;re going where the money is. That makes them untrustworthy.\nAirbnb\u0026rsquo;s evocative but meaningless cheap talk (for more, see their Shared Cities initiative) is cynical. I fear that, instead of promoting any realistic idea of sharing, Airbnb will pollute the whole idea as a consequence of the high-return venture capital model it has pursued.\n","date":1398125280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0b2995f2d0c11b9019534f1098265924","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/no-true-airbnb-host/","publishdate":"2014-04-22T00:08:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/no-true-airbnb-host/","section":"post","summary":"After months of waiting, Airbnb and the Attorney General of New York finally face each other in court this week to argue over the Attorney General's [subpoena](https://www.eff.org/document/new-york-ag-subpoena-airbnb) for information on the 15,000 or so Airbnb hosts in New York City (summary [at the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/21/airbnb-new-york-attorney-general-court), more opinion in the overview by Nitasha Tiku at [Valleywag](http://valleywag.gawker.com/new-york-wants-to-subpoena-15-000-users-after-airbnb-re-1565483113)).

That's why Airbnb collects stories from its hosts and puts them [on its web site](https://www.airbnb.ca/stories) and uses them liberally in its publicity.  When the economic crash hit, [Tama](https://www.airbnb.ca/stories/new-york/one-way-forward)’s livelihood as a painter and real estate broker was threatened. A serious health condition was only increasing her expenses, with prescription costs at times topping $1000 per month. Receiving guests not only introduced her to new friends—it allowed her to eat, pay her bills, and stay in her home. But Chris\u0026rsquo;s story is not on the Airbnb web site.\nIn San Francisco, [Chris](http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Airbnb-profits-prompted-S-F-eviction-ex-tenant-5164242.php?t=d6c1c46efd3c100abe#/0) lost his home so that his landlord could make more money by renting out apartments on Airbnb. Chris says: \"They forced me out of a home I loved. It was incredibly difficult to find a place, especially because I have a really old dog. I ended up paying over double what I was paying there.\" Chris is now suing his landlord and his attorney says: \"Airbnb is contributing to the displacement of long-term tenants in San Francisco... It has made it so easy to go into the short-term rental business; it is ubiquitous.\" Most stories on the Airbnb web site are about people renting out the homes in which they live.\n[Lisa and Byron](https://www.airbnb.ca/stories/new-york/full-house) are both artists, and have been their whole lives. They first met at an art residence in 1986, were married in 1993, and their family home in a Park Slope brownstone is where they raised their three kids. This past fall, when their son headed off to university, their downstairs sat empty, so when tuition bills started rolling in, Lisa realized Airbnb was a great solution to help pay for them. But not all Airbnb hosts rent the house in which they live.\nIn New York, [Chris](http://www.wnyc.org/story/two-true-stories-airbnb-wars/) lives in Brooklyn but rents out two bedrooms in a separate apartment he leases in Manhattan, at $100 per night. Sounds like a nice little earner. Some Airbnb hosts are generous, and are on the Airbnb web site.\nWhen New York City was hit by one of the worst hurricanes in history, [Shell](https://www.airbnb.ca/stories/new-york/sandys-impact), a long time host on Airbnb, realized that the loss for some people was devastating. As the waters rose and people had to evacuate their homes, many of them couldn’t return for days, if at all. Shell decided to go online and list her space for free for those who were in need. Airbnb is quick to claim Shell as part of its \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo;. It has\u0026rsquo;t been so quick to claim everyone. Not Ken\u0026rsquo;s tenant, for example.\nAlso in New York, [Ken](http://www.wnyc.org/story/two-true-stories-airbnb-wars/) owns a few buildings in Nolita. He runs a nonprofit that teaches people how to ride bicycles. Now he's hiring private investigators to see what his tenants are doing. Ken doesn't like it: “It’s so not me. It’s like how did I become that guy?” But Apartment 3 had become a kind of hotel, charging $250 a night and he suspects the tenant made half a million dollars before he evicted her. He says of Airbnb that “They see how lucrative her business was... And they refuse to take it down. So they’re not good guys.\" A lot of the Airbnb stories are about friendliness and about connections between people.\n[Jonathan](https://www.airbnb.com/stories/los-angeles/the-art-of-receiving) is a single dad raising three kids in Echo Park, Los Angeles. For years he worked 60-80 hour weeks at a job that was unfulfilling, scrambled to care for his three children, and had let his own ceramics studio fall by the wayside. When his schedule was cut back at work, Jonathan decided to list an extra room in his home on Airbnb. His first guest gave him such a positive review that more lined up, and he was soon renting out a second room as well. Hosting has become not only an extra source of income, it’s also allowed him to be more available to his own family. But Jerry\u0026rsquo;s story isn\u0026rsquo;t on the Airbnb web site.\n   [Jerry](http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/03/new_orleans_residents_slam_ill.html) lives in New Orleans. He says that \"In the French Quarter it is increasingly difficult to know your neighbors because they change every weekend.\"    I have resisted telling stories when writing about the sharing economy, even though almost every media report leads with one and even though I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to use them. I\u0026rsquo;ll continue to avoid them, in general, even though it probably limits the audience I\u0026rsquo;ll reach. Why? Because selective storytelling is manipulative and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a manipulator and I don\u0026rsquo;t want my readers to be manipulated. (Trust me.)\nIf you read a heart-warming story promoted by someone with a vested interest, you\u0026rsquo;re being sold a bill of goods. It really is as simple as that. The people in the story may be genuine; the story may be true, and they may be lovely people doing wonderful things. But there are millions of stories in every city, and the magic is in the selection (and the photography). By themselves, stories tell us nothing about the bigger picture, and it\u0026rsquo;s occasionally worth remembering that.\n","date":1390441150,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"e2ce89efb9c17149ee543af10e1c252f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/airbnb-stories/","publishdate":"2014-01-23T01:39:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/airbnb-stories/","section":"post","summary":"Telling stories is a powerful, personal way to communicate.

Fares increased up to eight times the normal, so that people were getting charged hundreds of dollars for short rides. The company's response was that surge pricing is [here to stay](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2013/12/8537861/uber-its-here-stay).  The argument is standard supply-and-demand, economics 101. If demand goes up, increase the price to increase supply. Or, as the company says:\nWith surge pricing, Uber rates increase to get more cars on the road and ensure reliability during the busiest times. When enough cars are on the road, prices go back down to normal levels. But there are two things that I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen elsewhere (correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong); not even on Matthew Yglesias\u0026rsquo;s post at Salon, and he is a magnificent observer of this and all other things.\nThing One: I really don\u0026rsquo;t care if you engage in \u0026ldquo;surge pricing\u0026rdquo; on New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, at rush hour, or at any other time when traffic is predictably busy. Knock yourself out, it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely fine by me. But surge pricing because of severe weather is something different, because at times of emergency we expect people to pull together: we expect people to check on their neighbours (for free!), to help people who are stuck (without charging!) and to generally be community-minded about things. Emphasizing monetary incentives at such a time undermines (or \u0026ldquo;crowds out\u0026rdquo;) community motives: if my neighbour and I help push your car out of a snowbank without payment then we\u0026rsquo;re just doing the right thing, but if my neighbour is being paid and I\u0026rsquo;m doing it for free, then I\u0026rsquo;m just being a mug. Surge pricing for reasons of severe weather is a bad idea. You may get a few more cabs on the road, but you make the emergency worse.\nThing Two: Customers were complaining that they didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the extra pricing until after they had taken their ride. Uber explained that they must have known: there was a perfectly clear screen notifying them about surge pricing, and they tapped the screen to agree to it. Now I used to do online documentation, and I\u0026rsquo;ve spent my fair share of time frustrated at the stupidity of users who cannot navigate my crystal-clear and elegant design (\u0026ldquo;Look: the button at the top there. It\u0026rsquo;s obvious\u0026rdquo;). But in the end anyone involved in user experience has to acknowledge that the user is right. What\u0026rsquo;s obvious to a designer or a trained user is not at all obvious to a casual user.\nSo if you design an app with the express purpose of making it easy to use without even thinking, and if a customer uses it fifty times and gets the same result each time, then they are not going to be paying attention the 51st time, especially after a few drinks. If you then add one extra screen in the middle of the ordering sequence that\u0026rsquo;s going to cost users an extra $300, then it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to test it till the cows come home to make sure that people know what they are agreeing to. Arguing that users should have been more careful is a really bad excuse. We should all read license agreements too, but none of us do. We just click, click, click until we get to the thing we want. Read? Of course I don\u0026rsquo;t read! And who\u0026rsquo;s ever heard of a $300 button in a mobile app? Sorry Uber: if you charge people an extra $300 for using your app too casually then it\u0026rsquo;s your own fault.\n","date":1388759100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"a02da60cba68fb25a166324aa4400ed7","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/on-surge-pricing/","publishdate":"2014-01-03T14:25:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/on-surge-pricing/","section":"post","summary":"Lots of controversy about the \u0026quot;surge-pricing\u0026quot; from car-rental outfit [Uber](http://uber.com), both during a [mid-December snowstorm](http://www.metro.us/boston/news/2013/12/15/uber-mad-boston-cab-passengers-vent-as-snow-drives-uber-prices-through-the-roof/) and on [New Year's Eve](http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/Uber_fields_dozens_of_complaints_about_hefty_New_Y_15849.aspx).

I suggested they would at the end of [this post](http://tomslee.net/2013/09/some-obvious-things-about-internet-reputation-systems.html):  To be successful, the venture-capital-funded \"sharing economy\" will be forced to lose all those aspects of informal sharing that makes \"sharing\" attractive, and to keep those aspects that erode neighbourhoods, erode employment rights, and remove basic standards. And if they succeed, they will have used the language of sharing to bring about an unregulated, free-market, neoliberal economy. In September Lyft, Sidecar, and Uber (with its Uber X service) were approved in California as a new class of \u0026ldquo;Transportation Network Companies\u0026rdquo;. Now both Lyft and Sidecar have done away with the pretence that the money passing from passenger to driver was a \u0026ldquo;donation\u0026rdquo; and have instituted a system of formal fares (as Uber already does). The idea that passengers may pay more or less than the suggested donation, which is a part of the casual and informal nature of the exchanges that sharing economy companies appeal to, is now gone for Californians.\nIn a separate move, Lyft has instituted a new \u0026ldquo;surge pricing\u0026rdquo; initiative, which amounts to requiring a 25% additional payment to drivers during periods of heavy demand. Similar to Uber\u0026rsquo;s surge pricing, this move appeals directly to price as a means of rationing, and assumes that drivers are motivated primarily by money, despite the heavy use of community-focused language that Lyft uses in its marketing. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to see if the attempt by Taxi companies to raise money to push back gains any momentum.\nThese moves are part of a rapid shift of the Venture Capital-funded part of the transport side of the sharing economy. They follow the sale of Lyft\u0026rsquo;s original Zimride Carpool service to rental-car giant Enterprise in July, the sale of Zipcar to Avis Budget in January, and the shift of RelayRides to longer-term rentals. The moves are a fascinating contrast to the success of French company Blablacar, which has a model much closer to the original carpool idea, is growing by leaps and bounds, and is now moving into the UK.\nThe best treatment I\u0026rsquo;ve seen of the latest changes in this transport area is by Liz Gannes at All Things D.\nThe other big announcement came from Airbnb, at a press conference at their very fancy headquarters. In addition to announcing new versions of their mobile apps, CEO Brian Chesky stepped away from his \u0026ldquo;our hosts are regular people\u0026rdquo; line to tell them \u0026rdquo;You\u0026rsquo;re in the business of hospitality\u0026rdquo;. Airbnb is bringing back a program calls Superhost, which \u0026ldquo;is meant to identify and reward some of the platform\u0026rsquo;s most active and highly recommended hosts\u0026rdquo;; as well as offering a Host Rewards Program to encourage people to rent more often. So again there is a move away from regular people \u0026ldquo;occasionally\u0026rdquo; renting a room out and earning a little extra money, to a revenue model that is driven by higher volume hosts. Airbnb already relies on these increasingly professional hosts for a significant chunk of its revenue as I showed in my look at its New York data: that trend is only going to accelerate.\nAgain, this week\u0026rsquo;s steps are part of a rapid movement. Over the last year Airbnb has moved towards a more formal security and identification system, demanding government documents as proof of identity along with the usual Facebook information. Not, it seems, that relying on positive reviews is foolproof, as a Washington DC woman found out recently. Airbnb Brian Chesky increasingly refers to his hosts as \u0026ldquo;micro-entrepreneurs\u0026rdquo;: emphasizing the market-driven view of the business that he has, and again moving away from a community model of sharing. The term started, I think, with TaskRabbit, another \u0026ldquo;sharing\u0026rdquo; company that is walking the same path: less community, more temp agency in Rabbit\u0026rsquo;s clothing.\nPush back from cities from Berlin and Paris to Roanoke City in Virginia to Grand Rapids in Michigan to Vancouver is growing, and the New York Case continues to roll on, with one notorious Airbnb landlord settling with the city. The danger here is that Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s hubris will damage other, less arrogant and less revenue-hungry companies who have engaged in apartment rentals for years (including the lovely one in Rome I was lucky enough to rent last spring) and that the venture capitalists, instead of bringing in a new level of sharing, will clumsily damage what\u0026rsquo;s already there.\n","date":1384917759,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"e8c93546c6ad69318250edfb177d202e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/this-week-in-the-sharing-economy-the-move-to-professionalism/","publishdate":"2013-11-20T03:22:39Z","relpermalink":"/post/this-week-in-the-sharing-economy-the-move-to-professionalism/","section":"post","summary":"In separate announcements, two of the most well-capitalized sharing-economy companies (Lyft and Airbnb) announced moves away from their \u0026quot;sharing\u0026quot; and co-operative roots.

One is from David Hantman, Airbnb’s public policy head hired from being Yahoo’s head of government relations, and it is here. The other is from CEO Brian Chesky, here.\nI was interested in whether there are other ways to frame the picture that Chesky paints of the Airbnb business in New York, so I wrote a bit of python that downloaded as many New York listings as I could find and stuck them in a database, and here’s a few notes from what they show. I collected 9527 places rented by 7112 hosts in New York. Airbnb claims 15,000 hosts, but I suspect the others are not doing much business because the searches I did over several days did not find them.\nIn New York, our 15,000 hosts are regular people from all five boroughs. Eighty-seven percent of them rent the homes in which they live. Of the 7112 hosts I found, 6038 rent one room, which is 85%. An even greater percentage (92%) rent from a single address, but there is no way to confirm if it is “the home in which they live”. These numbers are close enough to show that the data set is representative of the overall population.\nBut looking at it another way, only 63% (6038 of 9527) of rooms are single-room offerings (that is, a host who offers only one place to stay). And only 53% (60439 of 114659) of bookings are in single-room offerings (using reviews as a proxy for bookings). Assuming the same length of stay in each place, the amount of revenue that comes from single-room renters is 54%. That is, very nearly half of Airbnb’s business is from hosts who are renting multiple offerings.\nThe vast majority of these hosts are everyday New Yorkers who occasionally share the home in which they live. “Share the home” is open to interpretation. The stories that Chesky tells are all of people staying in their home while guests are present, which is the flavour of “sharing” that I get from the statement. But the majority of New York listings (5380 of 9527, or 56%) are for “entire home or apartment” compared to 3636 “private room” and only 511 “shared room”. The same percentage of bookings and 73% of total revenue comes from “entire home or apartment” rentals. The amount of Airbnb revenue that comes from people sharing a part of their home while they stay in it is only just over a quarter.\nChesky says that “If you want to understand Airbnb, you have to understand our beginnings” and describes how he and Joe Gebbia, both designers, had an idea when a design conference came to town: “why not turn our place into a bed and breakfast for the conference? We inflated air beds and called it the AirBed \u0026amp; Breakfast.” This sounds like a shared-room arrangement, but only 511 of 9527 offerings in New York are shared rooms (less than 6%) and less than 4% of the bookings are of this type. Today’s Airbnb has nothing to do with the “origin myth” that the company promotes.\nSo the Airbnb statements are not factually wrong, but are misleading: Airbnb’s financial interests do not align nearly as closely with its “community” as it claims.\n","date":1382155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"35ee2c8c33fda7c69dd1afe6a5e9ca7f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/notes-on-airbnbs-new-york-business/","publishdate":"2013-10-19T04:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/notes-on-airbnbs-new-york-business/","section":"post","summary":"[**Update, Nov 10:** clearer explanation [here](http://tomslee.net/2013/11/airbnb-business-in-new-york-revisited.html).

In contrast, this is a dense and not-easy-to-read step-by-step look at the internet reputation systems on which the sharing economy claims are based, with some predictions about the neoliberal future of the sharing economy. References, statistics, and, yes, some personal stories are relegated to footnotes. If you\u0026rsquo;re really interested you can download a PDF.\nIntroduction _Internet reputation systems_ let individuals rate other individuals over the internet and provide recommendations based on those ratings. A new class of enterprise claims to use internet reputation systems to enable sharing of personal goods and services at unprecedented scale. Its rise has been announced by both Forbes, and by The Economist, according to which accommodation rental service Airbnb…\n…is the most prominent example of a huge new “sharing economy”, in which people rent beds, cars, boats and other assets directly from each other, co-ordinated via the internet. …[T]echnology has reduced transaction costs, making sharing assets cheaper and easier than ever—and therefore possible on a much larger scale… social networks provide a way to check up on people and build trust; and online payment systems handle the billing. The claim is that internet reputation systems solve two problems. One is _coordination_ (can I find someone who has what I want, or wants what I have?) and the other is _trust_ (can you trust the person on the other side of the exchange to keep their end of the bargain?).1 Sharing economy advocates claim, and I will return to this at the end of the essay, that it is both necessary and sufficient to solve these problems to unlock a large new economy of resource sharing.\nTrust and Coordination To understand the sharing economy it is necessary to understand trust.2\nA _truster_ must decide whether or not to make a loan to a potential trustee; if the truster does make the loan, then the trustee must decide whether or not to repay it. We say the truster _trusts_ the trustee if she expects him to repay, and the trustee is _trustworthy_ if he would repay a loan, should the truster make it.\nTrust is a problem of asymmetric information: a truster cannot divine the trustee’s trustworthiness directly but must look instead for _signs_ of trustworthiness.\nAn _opportunist_ is someone who is _not_ trustworthy but who seeks to _mimic_ signs of trustworthiness in order to deceive potential trusters. Opportunists create what Bacharach and Gambetta call a “problem of secondary trust” which, they argue, “almost always accompanies, and is often the key to solving, problems of primary trust” (p158). Instead of just looking for signs of trustworthiness, the truster must decide whether she can trust those signs; instead of just displaying signs of trustworthiness, the trustee must convince the truster that he is not mimicking them.\nSecondary trust is a _signalling problem_ in the sense first spelled out by economist Michael Spence. An effective signal is an action or sign that is easy for a trustworthy person to display but costly for an untrustworthy person to display. If it’s not worth the effort for an opportunist to mimic the signal, we say that the signal _separates _trustworthy people from untrustworthy people or _discriminates_ between them. If no discriminating signal is available, then there is no way to distinguish trustworthy people from opportunists—an outcome that is called _pooling_—and trust cannot be established between truster and trustee. In real life, of course, we deal with probabilities rather than certainties, but there is a spectrum from separating to pooling outcomes in problems of trust.\n_The Economist_ observed, above, that the internet has reduced the transaction costs of collaboration, enabling what Yochai Benkler calls a “new modality of organizing production: radically decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary… ‘commons-based peer production’” (The Wealth of Networks, p60). But the problem of secondary trust emphasizes that low transaction costs do not necessarily improve collaboration.\nOther things being equal, and in the absence of opportunists, lower transaction costs (discovery and communication) should increase the amount of collaboration, but in the presence of opportunists—in what Bacharach and Gambetta call “mimic-beset trust games\u0026rdquo;—collaboration is possible only in the presence of an effective signalling mechanism, and lowering transaction costs can destroy trust-dependent collaboration by making it easier for opportunists to mimic trustworthiness.3\nReputation In the sense used here, reputation is a sign of trustworthiness manifested as testimony by other people. When my neighbour says “Don’t hire John the Plumber: he came to fix my sink but it’s still blocked”, she is providing information that lets me decide whether to trust John to fix my drains.\nWhen it works well, reputation is an effective discriminating signal that promotes trust and collaboration based on trust. In a community with strong word of mouth, it is easy for a good plumber to establish a reputation as reliable, punctual, and skilled simply by being reliable, punctual, and skilled; it is difficult for an incompetent or lazy plumber to do the same.\nReputation is not a perfect discriminating signal. Much of what is communicated in testimonies may be private and informal (“he fixed my sink and came on time, but there was something about him… I just didn’t like having him in my house”) and this privacy and informality can have both good and bad effects. It can transmit justified but nebulous suspicions, but it makes it difficult for John to gain a good reputation—no matter how trustworthy he is—if he is a black man trying to find work in a white community with a history of racism, or difficult for Jane the Plumber’s skills to be taken seriously if the community has traditional norms about women’s roles. “Old boys’ clubs” and other insider groups provide members with an inbuilt advantage when it comes to establishing a reputation.\nReputation is only one mechanism for solving the problem of trust. Others include reciprocity in long-term relationships, regulations (you can trust this restaurant because it has passed a food safety inspection), professional qualifications (you can trust this person to fix your leg because she is a doctor), voluntary industry certifications (you can trust this coffee to be fair trade because there is a fair trade label on the package), independent rating agencies, individual firm commitments (you can trust this retailer because they have invested heavily in their brand, and so must act accordingly), the common property regimes explored by Elinor Ostrom, and many others.\nReputation, in the sense used here, is peer-to-peer, informal, decentralized, community-driven, and non-commercial, and it is those alternative qualities that sharing economy advocates claim can be scaled up by using internet reputation systems. Airbnb and BlaBlaCar both describe themselves as “a trusted community marketplace”; Lyft’s one-million rides show “the power of community”.\nThe effectiveness of reputation depends on the motivations of those giving testimonies as well as on the actions of the trustee: the problem of secondary trust described above. Reputation is effective only if the testimonies are independent and free from the taint of collusion or retaliation. Testimony from John’s brother does not carry the same weight as that of someone who has no stake in John’s success or failure, and while John may not want my neighbour to tell me about his failure to fix their sink, there’s not a lot he can do about private conversations over a garden fence.\nMarket-based incentives erode the effectiveness of reputation, and in this respect reputation is a _cultural commons_ (see here, and see also me here). In her TED talk, influential author Rachel Botsman says that in the new economy “reputation will be your most valuable asset”, but as reputation becomes an important asset, markets will grow around it and intermediaries will claim to help you boost your reputation, but these market-based incentives destroy the value of reputation as a mechanism for establishing trust. Mechanisms for buying and selling testimonies, for example, cause testimonies to lose their ability to discriminate between trustworthiness and opportunism because an opportunist with money could buy themselves a good reputation.\nInternet Reputation Systems Internet reputation systems promise to create a global village by scaling up informal word-of-mouth reputation mechanisms for sharing and for creating trust, and so solve both the coordination and the trust problem for a variety of services which could not previously be exchanged. For sharing economy advocates, reputation is an alternative to regulation: in the recent book _The Reputation Economy,_ law professor Lior Strahilevitz asks us to “imagine if every plumber, manufactured product, cell phone provider, home builder, professor, hair stylist, accountant, attorney, golf pro, and taxi driver were rated… In such a world, there would be diminished need for regulatory oversight and legal remedies because consumers would police misconduct themselves.”\nDo internet reputation systems act as an effective signal of trustworthiness?\nFigure 1 is the distribution of ratings for the Netflix Prize data set. Netflix ratings are not a reputation system in the sense used here, in that they are not testimonials about people: the data set consists of ratings of movies and TV shows by Netflix customers. There is every reason to believe that the ratings are independent and honest: the rater can offer an opinion freely, having no reason to expect expect reward or punishment for any particular rating. The rater also has an incentive to give a rating that matches their actual opinion, as it enables Netflix to recommend movies that better match their tastes. So Figure 1 can take this as a reasonable distribution of independent ratings.\n Figure 1.\nBlaBlaCar, a French sharing economy company that connects “drivers with people travelling the same way” throughout Europe, has over a million registered drivers, transports over half a million passengers every month, and is expanding rapidly. Also, it makes testimonial-based ratings available on its web site. Figure 2 is the distribution of a set of 190,000 ratings from the blablacar.com site.4\n Figure 2.\nOf 190129 distinct ratings, 2152 were one-star, there was not a single two-star rating, there was one three-star rating, five four-star ratings, and 187971 five-star ratings. A BlaBlaCar rating means something different from a Netflix movie rating.\nWith over 98% of ratings being five stars, the reputation system does not meaningfully discriminate among drivers or riders. A reputation system that does not discriminate fails as a reputation system: it fails to solve the problem of trust.5\nCollusion and fear of retaliation are the reasons why there are essentially no reviews less than five stars for rides that take place. If you give a less-than-five star review then, unlike in the case of offline community-based testimonials, it is visible to the reviewee, who can give you a harsh review in return and so affect your chance of getting future rides. Do you want to defend your opinion that the driver was a bit close to the car in front, or that the car was a bit dirty, or do you just want to give a five-star review and make a note to yourself not to ride with them again? Collusion is the other side of the retaliation coin: I know I turned up late and was eating smelly food in your car and you didn’t like it, but so long as you give me five stars I’ll give you a good positive rating and we’re both better off. Neither of these factors need to be explicit or even to be very important to produce large effects, because it makes no difference to me how I rate you. One seemingly tiny difference between word-of-mouth and the internet rating system makes all the difference, that testimonials are visible to everyone _including_ the reviewee instead of everyone _except_ the reviewee.\nThe problem is not unique to BlaBlaCar. Reciprocity and collusion in the eBay reputation system has been studied here and the authors also provide an estimate of how many dissatisfied people are not rating their trustee:\nThe fact that from 742,829 eBay users… who received at least one feedback, 67% have a percentage positive of 100%, and 80.5% have a percentage positive of greater than 99%, provides suggestive support for the bias. The observation is in line with Dellarocas and Wood (2008) who examine the information hidden in the cases where feedback is not given. They estimate, under some auxiliary assumptions, that buyers are at least mildly dissatisfied in about 21% of all eBay transactions, far higher than the levels suggested by the reported feedback. They argue that many buyers do not submit feedback at all because of the potential risk of retaliation. Finally, on Airbnb, reviewing of hosts by guests and guests by hosts also happens in public and is reciprocal. The Airbnb web site does not display individual numerical reviews, although it does display individual text reviews; instead it displays the average rating that a room has received in each of several categories (cleanliness, location, communication,…) together with an overall average, rounded off to the nearest 0.5 out of five. The web site is less easy to traverse programmatically, but out of well over a hundred offerings in New York, Sydney, Berlin and Paris I have yet to see a single one that is not rated 4.5 or 5.6\nSo even in the absence of explicit gaming, peer-to-peer internet reputation systems do not solve the problem of trust. The BlaBlaCar site fails the basic test of discriminating among almost any of the 190,000 drives that took place—it fails to deliver any useful information beyond giving the occasional sign that a driver or rider may not turn up.\nThe “Growth” of the “Sharing Economy” Rachel Botsman claims that “Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea”, and she describes the meteoric growth of the sharing economy. The picture she paints would seem to be incompatible with the idea that internet reputation systems fail to solve the problem of trust. What’s going on?\nSome perspective is in order. The rapid growth of individual sharing economy companies does not represent the appearance of new social practices of sharing. The growth of sharing economy companies is, at least in part, a movement of already-existing social practices to online forums.\n“Letting strangers stay in your home” has long been a common practice. Millions of people let strangers stay in their homes without the benefit of internet reputation systems: the overall vacation rental market, which includes cottages, apartments, second homes and other personal rentals, is much larger than Airbnb.7 , 8\nSimilarly, BlaBlaCar is a small fraction of the overall carpooling practice, which precedes internet reputation systems. Carpooling has been a widespread practice in many urban centres for decades, encouraged by local governments and transit authorities with “Park-and-Ride” facilities, especially in Europe where fuel costs are higher than North America. Student union noticeboards have long been a way to coordinate rides home for the weekend.9 , 10\nThe dispersed nature of tourism boards, local travel authorities, booking agencies, university notice boards, and so on make counting trips and visits difficult, while the centralized nature of sharing economy sites makes data collection trivial for those with the infrastructure, so it is easy to underestimate—or entirely neglect—the pre-existing economy.\nAlso, not all the activity on sharing economy websites is of the personal, informal kind that the site owners portray, so the growth of these companies overstates the growth of sharing. Multiple rentals are common, suggesting rentals of properties other than the host’s primary residence, such as investment properties.11 , 12\nThe Problem of Trust in the Sharing Economy Still, sharing economy web sites are growing fast. How are they succeeding if the peer-to-peer reputation systems fail to solve the problem of trust?\nOne reason is that coordination is useful in itself. Classified ads, whether local newspapers or sites like Craigslist and Kijiji, solve coordination problems but do not even try to solve problems of trust beyond the most basic verification. It’s left to individuals to contact each other, make arrangements, decide on the terms of a sale, and complete the deal. In trading second-hand lawnmowers for cheap prices, the worst that can happen to a purchaser is that they overpay by a few dollars, and that’s a risk that many are prepared to take. One option for sharing economy companies would be to accept that they are solving only the simpler coordination problem, and adopt a business model that has no involvement in the transaction itself and which charges small listing fees.13 But such a business model will not provide the returns that venture capital is expecting from this industry. Sharing economy companies funded by venture capital have no option but to solve the problem of trust.\nIn some cases, community membership itself has provided an adequate signal of trustworthiness, particularly in communities that are prepared to accept some level of risk. Opportunists are screened out, to the extent that they need to be, by an implicit community selection process, so that matching _within_ the community is reduced to a coordination problem. For example, travel site Couchsurfing built itself largely by word-of-mouth among young travellers. Couchsurfing members pre-selected themselves to be adventurous (so not looking for a high degree of assurance from the organization) and community-minded individuals with a common interest in travel. Simply being part of the Couchsurfing community was a sign that correlated with trustworthiness, and community members voluntarily undertook the additional risk that came with the program.\nUnfortunately, community membership as a sign of trustworthiness does not survive large scale growth, for two reasons.\nAs a community grows, it attracts opportunists. In a small community, the benefit to an opportunist of mimicking a sign of trustworthiness is small, but as the community scales, the potential benefits for opportunists are larger, and the incentive to mimic trustworthiness is greater. In evolutionary terms, Bacharach and Gambetta describe the phenomenon as “model precedes mimic”. Sharing economy sites have benefited from community membership as a screening process, but as they become larger they will need new solutions.\nSecond, people who have a commitment to a community may be prepared to take on additional personal risk, either because of the nature of the community itself (a community of adventurers is not looking for a high level of security) or because they are prepared to overlook lapses to support the community. There is a reciprocity, not just between individuals, but between the members and the community-as-a-whole. However, the revenue and growth models of venture-capital funded companies are based on providing a service that can scale to people with no particular commitment to the community itself. As _AllThingsD_ reporter Liz Gannes writes: “maintaining customer trust is paramount because, at any given moment, they are all one bad incident away from users turning back to more traditional arrangements”\nThe Future of the Sharing Economy Venture capital demands for scale will produce changes in the nature of the sharing economy sites, changes that erode any community focus they have, and which turn them into far more traditional models. Such changes are already underway at the largest, most heavily funded sites.\nAs Gannes reports, a single bad incident has forced Airbnb to hire a 50-person “trust and safety team” headed by a former US Army intelligence office and a former government investigator. The use of a human team clearly doesn’t scale, so Airbnb is now turning to centralized analysis to solve its problems, saying “We want to apply data to every decision. We want to be a very data-driven company.” On April 30 2013, asserting that “Trust is the key to our community”, Airbnb introduced a “Verified ID program” which demands that you provide government-verified identification and permit the company to analyze your social networking presence or provide it with a video profile.\nThere is also a drive for more professionalism among hosts. Airbnb now lets hosts sell tours and activities, and here is Chip Conley, the new “Head of Global Hospitality” for Airbnb, hired from the hotel industry, in a September 2013 interview:\nWe’ll be introducing nine minimum standards around what we expect an Airbnb experience to be, whether it’s related to cleanliness or the basic amenities you expect, which is not currently the case. The idea that we create some amenities that you should expect—clean towels, clean sheets—that’s important. In short, Airbnb is abandoning the idea that peer-to-peer reputation systems can solve the problem of trust, is moving away from the casual “air bed” mentality that gave it its name, and is resorting to traditional centralized systems of enforced minimum standards, documentary verification, and so on.\nThere is, however, one remaining difference between Airbnb and a traditional hospitality business. To go back to the beginning of this essay, sharing economy companies claim that it is both necessary _and sufficient_ to solve problems of trust and coordination to unlock a large new economy of resource sharing. The “sufficient” part of this is valid only if there are no spill-over effects from the operations of the sharing economy, so sharing economies will campaign for freedom from those constraints that prevent them maximizing their returns: health and safety standards, employment standards, licensing laws, and so on.14\nTo be successful, the venture-capital-funded “sharing economy” will be forced to lose all those aspects of informal sharing that makes “sharing” attractive, and to keep those aspects that erode neighbourhoods, erode employment rights, and remove basic standards. And if they succeed, they will have used the language of sharing to bring about an unregulated, free-market, neoliberal economy.\nFootnotes 1 For example, economist Arun Sundararajan says that in peer-to-peer marketplaces “Reputation systems and active supplier screening maintain quality” and that “These reputation systems take community enforcement up a few notches from the time of the Maghribis, combining numerical scores and textual feedback with reviews, pictures, and peer references that are instantly visible to any potential market participant. By making both product and trader quality instantly transparent, this approach reduces the risks that often lead to market failure”; PBS Newshour says that “Users trust each other according to a person’s accumulated social credit; user ratings thus form a currency to increase the odds of finding a willing driver”; and in a January 2013 interview Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said “Well it turns out that cities can’t screen as well as technologies can screen. Companies have these magical things called reputation systems”; Forbes writes that “Ebay’s much-duplicated rating system bestows commercial credibility on individuals”.\n2 The description draws from the work of sociologist Diego Gambetta, who has spent years writing about trust, and in particular from a 2001 article written with Michael Bacharach.\n3 The need for trust in collaboration is essential to opposition movements in authoritarian states, which is one reason I don’t believe that the “low transaction costs” of social media were key to the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. I have made trust-based arguments here and more formally in this working paper.\n4 Methodology: In a BlaBlaCar rating, a reviewer gives a rating to a reviewee. The first step of the algorithm is to record all the ratings of an individual user. Each subsequent step chose a new reviewee by selecting at random from the lists of reviewers, and then records all the ratings for that user. There are cases where a single reviewer has reviewed a single reviewee multiple times; these were discarded. Only the numerical rating was recorded, and if a reviewer has not been reviewed by anyone a single “null” rating was recorded. The procedure is far from scientific, but at 190,000 ratings is way better than a few anecdotes, which is the point.\n5 Almost all the one-star ratings are given when the rider and driver failed to meet without cancelling ahead of time. Perhaps the rider didn’t turn up, or perhaps the driver didn’t, but one way or another the ride didn’t happen. If a ride takes place, it is almost universal that each of the pair will give the other a five-star rating.\n6 See also this question on Quora for impressionistic responses.\n7 In 2013, Airbnb claims over 300,000 listings, but a 2010 study showed that “more than 6 million vacation properties in the U.S. and Europe were being rented out to travelers for a fee at least two weeks of every year”. Ad Age reports that Airbnb’s 2012 revenue was $150 million, which a little arithmetic based on 3 percent host fees and at least 6 percent guest fees suggests it is part of $1.5B in transactions. The same survey estimated the global vacation rental market at $85 billion in 2010, at an average of $14,000 per property. Supporting these estimates, a report by market research firm PhocusWright estimates the size of the overall vacation-rentals market in the US alone to be $23 billion, and vacation rentals in Europe are much more popular.\n8 Personal story: During my childhood my mother booked almost all our family holidays from the Farm Holiday Guide, which listed farmhouses that provided either bed-and-breakfast or self-contained accommodations throughout the UK.This practice was not unusual. For four years, we stayed with Miss Whittaker in the Duddon Valley in the Lake District. She was a dinner lady at the local school, and rented out accommodations to supplement her income. She had a sheepdog called Jan, which we played with in her back garden. When it rained, which was often, we would read books from her bookshelves: I first encountered Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot at Miss Whittaker’s house when I was about ten. My younger brother would sometimes get up early in the morning and sit in the kitchen with her, colouring in a colouring book while Miss Whittaker started her day. Families I know in Ontario have rented out cottages for decades, through personal contacts and scattered local tourism organizations like this one.\n9 BlaBlaCar hosts half a million passengers a month, which sounds like a huge number, but in the year 2000 12% of the 128.3 million workers in the US carpooled to work (US Census) which, assuming two people per car, is around 7 million passengers a day, excluding non-work trips.\n10 Personal story: My own pre-digital ridesharing experiences include a year of commuting between Hamilton and Waterloo, driven by four different—and all wonderful—people, as well as several years of intermittent and luckily incident-free hitch-hiking in the UK, mainly between Leeds and London.Quiz for the reader: how would you rate the following drivers?\n The German ex-prisoner of war who stayed in the UK and who gave me a ride in a small lorry, spending much of the ride explaining in a friendly manner how Hitler had been misunderstood.\n The driver who spent 30 minutes complaining about how dark-skinned immigrants were wrecking the country.\n The driver of the empty lorry who explained that he was picking up my friend Lawrence and myself on a windy day just to provide some extra ballast.\n The driver who had cerebral palsy and whose hand shook increasingly as he reached for the gear lever, explaining that he drove better when he’d had a couple of drinks because he didn’t tremble as much.\n Women may experience many kinds of problem that I have never faced. What is the acceptable level of flirtatiousness and/or overt propositioning from a driver? And would you report over-the-line behaviour if the driver had your phone number?\n  11 Personal story: Rachel Botsman also makes a point that the sharing economy now means you can stay in unusual places, not just regular hotels. When I was three years old my parents rented a converted railway carriage near Aberdovey in Wales. The jellyfish on the beach were disgusting, but otherwise it was fun.\n12 Personal story: my sister and I tried to book an apartment in Rome in spring of 2013 through http://www.homeaway.co.uk/. The owner said that apartment wasn’t available, but another one listed on http://www.homelidays.co.uk/ was free. We never met the owner, but we did meet a cleaner who had a key. The rental was clearly a business transaction, and the apartment was one of six owned by the same person. The experience was very similar to booking a traditional bed and breakfast or holiday apartment through emails, websites, or even older mechanisms.\n13 Thanks to Eric Farrar for insights into the differences between sites like Kijiji and sites like eBay.\n14 One of the legal challenges faced by Airbnb is that local governments demand licensing of rental accommodation for reasons that go beyond the interests of the landlord/host and tenant/guest to include the interests of neighbours and wider community. Airbnb must campaign against such rules if it is to maintain its growth. It is no surprise that the first two actions of the new sharing economy advocacy group Peers are in support of two of the best funded companies: Airbnb and Lyft. The very first action was to campaign in the Silver Lake neighbourhood of Los Angeles against restrictions on short-term rentals. San Francisco is the home base for the venture-capital wing of the sharing economy, and claims of unnecessary bureaucracy are now running into the claims of neighbours. In the Mission district, local newspaper El Tecolotereports on how people are making large amount of money by “using a unit that’s rent controlled and they’re taking the space away from people who really need a place to stay in San Francisco” and gentrifying the Mission neighbourhood, pushing native residents out.\n","date":1380508842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f18be148611954f2faf031624ff05b83","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/some-obvious-things-about-internet-reputation-systems/","publishdate":"2013-09-30T02:40:42Z","relpermalink":"/post/some-obvious-things-about-internet-reputation-systems/","section":"post","summary":"Update 2: This essay is the starting point for Chapter 7: \u0026ldquo;Strangers Trusting Strangers\u0026rdquo;, in my book \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s Yours is Mine\u0026rdquo; (2015 in the US and the UK; 2016 in Canada and elsewhere).\nUpdate: now with added footnotes.\nDebates around the “sharing economy” have been driven by personal stories and broad claims.

Back in 2006 the world of microfinance split between “pure do-gooders and profit-minded do-gooders”, between Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammed Yunus and eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar. Yunus’s Grameen Bank had pioneered group-based credit for the impoverished, but had stayed away from making the Bank into a public company; Omidyar wanted to turn microfinance into a fully commercial, profit-making sector.\nA few years later Hugh Sinclair, who spent several years working for microfinance institutions, compellingly described his disillusionment and anger at the way the industry was going in Confessions of a Microfinance Heretic: as money flooded into the microfinance institutions, they became like the loan sharks they replaced. At the centre of the book is the Lift Above Poverty Organization (LAPO), a Nigerian microfinance institution (MFI). It charged deceptive and high interest rates, it was audited by the brother of the CEO, and it siphoned money into many already-wealthy pockets. As microfinance grew in scale it spawned a web of interacting operations: microfinance funds invest in microfinance institutions which are rated by microfinance rating agencies, and which make loans through other partners. Principal-agent problems become pervasive and, without a regulatory framework, there were incentives everywhere that not only enabled corruption but, Sinclair argues, pushed participants to keep a lid on stories of corruption—to try to fix them quietly rather than to risk the reputation of the broader industry. Taking a charity and turning it into a bank is, Sinclair says, a great way to build assets and then capitalize on them.\nBeyond generally promoting the market-driven approach to microfinance, Omidyar Network was a big donor to Unitus, a microfinance fund embroiled in a 2010 scandal involving Indian MFI SKS. When SKS went public, raising $350m in its IPO, Unitus backed out of microfinance: “In charity circles, people wondered about the motives of the Unitus board members, at least four of whom had invested in SKS Microfinance themselves and thus would reap profits from the I.P.O.” More controversy followed in 2012 when it was revealed that over 200 poor, debt-ridden residents of Andhra Pradesh killed themselves in late 2010. The state blamed microfinance companies for fueling a frenzy of \u0026ldquo;overindebtedness and then pressuring borrowers so relentlessly that some took their own lives\u0026rdquo;.\nSinclair concludes that “Frankly, I think the only means to rein in these groups is to formally regulate them.” (p227) He also notes that “Impact Investing”, which is the Omidyar Network’s current emphasis, has similar problems: “I do not believe there are panaceas for poverty reduction – it is hard work and requires a number of tools used wisely and collaboratively” (p236).\nA lesson of the story is that, as capital and social action have conflicting goals, using markets to scale up social action can destroy the very thing that made it special in the first place.\nMicrofinance operates at the border between charity and business. LAPO was for several years a major partner of Omidyar-funded “peer-to-peer” lender Kiva, until Kiva cut ties in 2010. The episode highlighted a fact that was worrying some observers, including David Roodman: “peer-to-peer” lending is not actually peer-to-peer, instead Kiva works with intermediary partners which in turn make loans which were not, as many thought, interest-free.\n  *  Anyway, new topic. Last year I was reviewing a book on the reputation economy which included a chapter by the founders of GlobalGiving, an Omidyar-funded “Internet-based service focused on making international philanthropy more efficient and high impact”. GlobalGiving set out to use technology and capital to scale up charitable giving, just as Omidyar had set out to use capital and commerce to scale up microfinance. Believing in Omidyar’s vision of “market-based efforts that catalyze economic and social change”, GlobalGiving adopted a “hybrid model” involving a parallel company (ManyFutures) that provided a technology platform to support its charitable work. But ManyFutures never made money, so the funding transfer ended up going from GlobalGiving to ManyFutures rather than the other way round, and controversy ensued. As with microfinance, the idea that capital and sharing are natural complements went wrong.\nThe idea that bringing commerce to play can scale up nonprofit efforts has become commonplace in the technology world, and the Omidyar Network is the poster child for mixing profit and sharing. It’s a “philanthropic investment firm” that supports “market-based approaches with the potential for large-scale, catalytic impact”; it’s taken a lead in “impact investing”, and in “social enterprise”. The ideas of social entrepreneurship, Benefit Corporations or the closely-related B Corporation sound sunny—who doesn’t want to Do Well by Doing Good?—but capital has a way of eroding sharing-based initiatives. The hybrid charity and microfinance examples are two that I had come across, but it doesn’t stop there\u0026hellip;\n  *  So a little while ago, I wrote about the tensions between capital and commons in an essay called Open Wide, at The New Inquiry. As part of the research for that essay I looked at what had happened to travel community Couchsurfing, and wrote this:\nIn his book _Cognitive Surplus_, Clay Shirky highlighted Couchsurfing, a site where young global travelers can arrange to visit and host each other, as a healthy digital commons. Couchsurfing started life as couchsurfing.org, not couchsurfing.com; even the code that ran the site was provided by the Couchsurfers themselves. But the site did have owners, and in August 2011, they incorporated and accepted $7.6 million in venture funding. As the company’s market value has grown, the Couchsurfing community has deteriorated. A long-time Couchsurfer laments the days of “art gatherings, bonfires, a weekly meet up at a bar, café gatherings, potlucks,” now lost. The community’s former strength turned out to have little to do with technology. As a commenter at Quora writes: “The old Couchsurfing thrived with a very haphazard and underfunded management structure precisely because local volunteers around the world believed they were part of a cause bigger than profit. Local collectives were highly tied to their local communities… The technical architecture of the new systems is much better, but paradoxically the ‘professional’ product development process fixes things that were broken on purpose. In other words, Couchsurfing evolved around certain quirks and inefficient processes that actually became critical to the health of the social trust platform.” Over 5000 Couchsurfing members have joined the forum **We are Against CS becoming a for-profit corporation**. Contrast Couchsurfing with [Hostelling International](http://www.hihostels.com/), a venerable network of national youth hostelling organizations that has remained resolutely nonprofit. Over 100 years old, it is still going strong and “currently provides 35 million overnight stays a year through more than 4,000 hostels in over 80 countries.” Some people do support themselves through the commons of hostels — some work in the hosteling organizations, others are paid to run hostels themselves — but it’s orders of magnitude away from the sudden injection of millions of venture-capital dollars. What I didn’t do was name the organization that funded Couchsurfing’s transition from nonprofit to profit-driven company. But you know what it is: it’s the Omidyar Network. Again, it saw markets and profit as a way to scale up a non-market operation, and again the profit motive is driving out the non-commercial effort that is needed to sustain a trusting community. Couchsurfing will not have the longevity of Hostelling International, just as GlobalGiving will not have the longevity of Oxfam.\nUpdate (October 15 2013): Couchsurfing\u0026rsquo;s CEO just resigned and 40% of the staff was layed off. See here and the announcement here.\n  *  Before writing Open Wide, I wrote some things about Open Government, including Seeing Like a Geek at the Crooked Timber group blog. Open Government Data is yet another area where commerce and sharing sound like they mix nicely, but where there are real problems. In short, one of the things that making data open does is to make it free. If action around open data is kept non-commercial, then it may form an alternative to profit-driven action, but if commercial use of open data becomes the predominant form then all that has happened is that one form of industry has been replaced by another, and as the new industry is technology-driven it is more likely to be an oligopoly than the industry it replaces.\nNo surprise, then, that as I was doing the research for that piece it turns out that the Omidyar Network is deeply involved in both the Open Government Partnership at the international level, in Code for America in the USA, and is the first major investor in the UK Open Data Institute. At Code for America, which describes itself as a new kind of public service, Omidyar has funded an Accelerator arm which invests in startups, conveniently augmenting the idea of “service” with the contradictory idea of “entrepreneurship” and blurring the boundaries between those who want to make money from government contracts and those who want to contribute to a stronger civic space. Unsurprisingly, the Open Data initiative has been colonized by major companies.\n  *  And still we are not done. Here is one final case where the Omidyar Network’s vision of social enterprise leads to more enterprise, but less social. In 2012 Change.org joined Couchsurfing as a “.org” site with a for-profit motive–a misleading presentation of the organization’s mandate. Change.org changed its mandate from being a broadly progressive non-profit to a for-profit company, allowing “corporate advertising, Republican Party solicitations, astroturf campaigns, anti-abortion or anti-union ads and other controversial sponsorships”. In May 2013 it took venture capital from the Omidyar Network and others in order to scale up, and the nature of the organization changed. The change in mission was described by Lindsay Beyerstein in In These Times and Ryan Grim of The Huffington Post.\nThe Omidyar/Change.org press release uses the standard language of social entrepreneurs: blandly inspirational and content-free.\n“Social enterprises can play an instrumental role in solving some of the world’s biggest problems,” Rattray said. “This funding will help us continue to expand our empowerment tools internationally while innovating on new products with the potential for disruptive social impact.” Every challenge is a problem, rather than a conflict. Who can disagree with phrases like this?\nOmidyar Network was founded on the fundamental belief that every person has the power to make a difference. We create opportunity for people to realize that power and improve the quality of their lives. When people take the initiative to make life better for themselves, they can share the benefits with their families, become more active in their communities, and be a more positive force in society. These failures demonstrate concretely what I have been arguing more generally: that the idea of a natural synergy between business and sharing, between capital and commons—encoded in the ideas of social enterprise, in the Apache flavours of open source license, and in the variant of open content licensing favoured by Omidyar-funded organizations—is fraught with tensions and contradictions. Also, I may be wrong, but from what I can see these repeated failures have not been addressed by Omidyar Network in a public way.\n","date":1378652100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"696f82377bdd704e0eae1fb5024fee48","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/six-degrees-of-omidyar/","publishdate":"2013-09-08T14:55:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/six-degrees-of-omidyar/","section":"post","summary":"_Venture capital damages commons-based sharing, and one name appears time and time again..._  [Update: a version of this post, re-edited in the light of the Omidyar/Greenwald news venture, is now at The New Inquiry: Charity Assets.]\nStart with an old story.

I joined [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.com) about four months ago, but I’m going to talk about a different organization. He means Peers.\nIn fact I’d like to talk about a movement for the sharing economy. By “a movement” I mean exactly that. I mean huge numbers of people, with a shared identity, mobilized to take action to do two things: to grow the peer sharing economy, and to fight for their collective interests against unfair and unreasonable obstacles. A grassroots organization with 40 corporate “partners”, with unspecified but significant funding, formed with guidance from a set of high-profile “thought leaders”, without local chapters, and with nothing much for the grassroots to do, but with an Executive Director on day one.\nAndrew Leonard from Salon has been following the story, and tells us that funding comes from “mission-aligned independent donors”. So that’s wealthy backers with a financial interest in the sharing economy. This is not grassroots, it’s astroturf.\nIf there is one thing that makes me angry, it is people appropriating the language of collective and progressive politics for financial gain. And that’s one thread of what’s going on here. As we shall see. It does seem that Executive Director Natalie Foster’s heart is in the right place, but that’s one of the tragedies of the sharing economy: well-intentioned people end up contributing to immiseration and injustice when they think they are doing the opposite.\nSo what we’re talking about here is not just people sharing their skills, or their apartment, or their car, but also their collective power to expand the sharing economy together, and to stand up against entrenched interests who stand unfairly in their way. So “people power” if you like, or more accurately “peer power”. And what we’re not talking about here is venture capital. Going through Crunchbase tells me that the total funding for the 40 partners is over $600M. AirBnB has received $120M, including funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Jeff Bezos, Ashton Kucher. You know, people standing up against entrenched interests.\nAt the end of this post I’ve added a table of what I could find. It tells us that almost all the funding is going to the Bay Area or New York. The non-profits in this organization are being taken for a ride by the appealing anti-establishment language of Silicon Valley . They need to take a look at who their bedfellows are and what the real agenda is.\nVenture Capital funds are not interested in people power, they are interested in an investment with a good return. The fact that Douglas Atkin doesn’t once mention the financial motivations of the forces behind the sharing economy is either dishonest or unbelievably self-deceiving.\nNow why would there be a need for such a thing? The sharing economy seems to be barrelling along pretty happily. Why do we need another organization? Well, firstly the opportunity. This was brought home to me a week ago in San Francisco where I attended a meeting of sharing economy participants. So there were drivers, passengers, hosts, guests, and tour guides from [RelayRides](http://relayrides.com), Lyft, AirBnB, Vayable and Sidecar, and they were literally bouncing up and down with enthusiasm about the opportunity to collaborate together — with each other. So they were developing ideas — brilliant ideas actually — to share customers with each other, across verticals. One person even suggested that there could be a peer economy currency — maybe Bitcoin. Or even points to encourage people to cross verticals and recruit new people into this new economy. The language changes, the mask slips. Participants become customers, sharing becomes buying. The phrase “across verticals” reminds us that Douglas Atkin is an advertising executive. Now the sharing economy is about loyalty programs and cross marketing? Not the kind of sharing I want to be part of. I don’t have a problem with commerce, but what I do object to is commerce wrapped up in, and appropriating, the language of solidarity.\nThese people were incredibly impressive, with their passion and their eagerness and creativity to work together locally to expand the sharing economy. So that was the opportunity. It was incredibly exciting to see that. And I did a couple more of these types of meetings, with people from different verticals in the sharing economy in New York, where the same thing happened. So there’s the opportunity. The Peers organization came together, then, in San Francisco and New York – the well-heeled, well-funded districts of the sharing economy movement.\nSecondly, though, there’s the challenges. It’s unlikely, I believe — and I believe this because I used to work for them — that the entrenched interests of the old economy are going to stand idly by as their business model of the past seventy years is challenged by the new economy. Billion-dollar venture capital funds are out to undercut people who run licensed bed and breakfasts, and he’d have me believe that it’s the B\u0026amp;B owners who are the “entrenched interests”. If this is your idea of a revolution (and it is, unbelievably enough: that comes later) then brother don’t you know, you can count me out.\nWhat’s more, outdated laws and new laws which have been badly conceived, with unintended consequences, really threaten the growth of this nascent new world economy. The laws that he is talking about are licensing laws and other laws put in place to protect employees, customers, and neighbourhoods. These laws are not all perfect. But the sharing economy has nothing to replace them beyond magical thinking about “trust” (with little accountability).\nHow much better would it be if citizens banded together to grow and protect their interests in the sharing economy rather than companies wielding their power? How about banding together to protest when a TaskRabbit customer posts a job to do four loads of laundry and it’s actually 10 or 15 loads covered in cat diarrhea? No: if you do that, you’re fired. The company (a partner of Peers.org, natch) also takes steps to prevent its TaskRabbits from meeting because “They don’t want us unionizing”. I’m sorry, what was that about citizens banding together against companies?\nSo I’m here to tell you about some plans which will enable people to create a member-driven movement for the sharing economy. If you like, a new kind of union for a new kind of economy. And I’m also here to ask for your support. So if you’re a platform: help your users create this organization and join it. If you’re a thought-leader, blogger, or conference speaker: champion it. And if you’ve got some ready cash, please help fund it. A new kind of union? What, me and Peter Thiel, billionaire investor in TaskRabbit? Sorry, I won’t be handing over my cash any time soon.\nNow why should you do this? Well it’s the right thing to do. We literally stand on the brink of a new, better kind of economic system, that delivers social as well as economic benefits. In fact, social and economic benefits that the old economy promised but failed to deliver. As Julia, an AirBnB host, told me just last night, “the sharing economy saved my arse”. The sharing economy is not an alternative to capitalism, it’s the ultimate end point of capitalism in which we are all reduced to temporary labourers and expected to smile about it because we are interested in the experience not the money. Jobs become “extra money” just like women’s jobs used to be “extra money”, and like those jobs they don’t come with things like insurance protection, job security, benefits – none of that old economy stuff. But hey, you’re not an employee, you’re a micro-entrepreneur. And you’re not doing it for the money, you’re doing it for the experience. We just assume you’re making a living some other way.\nThe old economy has largely failed us. Most people are not experiencing the economic independence and the happiness that mass production and consumerism promised. Partly, in a way, because the old system centralizes production, wealth and control. That’s just the way it works. And in a sense, that’s largely to blame. The peer sharing economy is a new model, which distributes power, wealth, and control to everyone else. Best of all, the very things that have become the casualties of the old economy — things like economic independence, entrepreneurialism, community, individuality, happiness — are actually built in to the very structure of this new economy. You can’t do sharing without building community, without creating individualized experiences. The sharing economy is the centralization of global casual labour. Investors invest because individual sharing economy companies have the potential for global reach, collecting a little from each of millions of transactions around the world, and funnelling it to California.\nWe’ve had this ridiculous debate for the past thirty years ago in this old economy about a work/life balance, because the honest truth is life gets squeezed out because of work. As Rachel says: doing jobs we hate to buy shit we don’t need. But in this sharing economy, life is built in. So Etsy producers get to know their consumers and sell individualized goods. Whenever I take a Lyft or a Sidecar — which are ride-sharing organizations in San Francisco — I always ask them “So why are you doing this?” And their first response is “To interact and meet with new and interesting people”. And then secondly, the flexible hours and a bit of extra cash. It’s the community they are most interested in experiencing. Trashing consumerism appeals to many environmentally-minded, social-justice oriented people. But if you displace taxi drivers and replace them with casual labour, you’re not improving the work/life balance of drivers, you’re making them poorer.\nFred Mazella was a genius when he named blablacar [blablacar](http://www.blablacar.com/), because he’s actually naming what happens in the car. He named his organization not after the transaction, which is ridesharing, but because people communicate and go “bla bla bla” to each other in the car. He correctly identified what the real benefit of the sharing economy is, which is these other social and economic rewards. You know, I talk to taxi drivers too. Some of them are interesting people. You should try it sometime.\nSo there’s a nascent organization which is about to bloom. It’s independent, it’s member-driven, it’s global, it’s not a trade association, it’s not a lobbying group. It will use peer power and collective action to grow the sharing economy and overcome unfair obstacles. I don’t know if he’s lying or if he believes this stuff, but take a look at the website of Peers.org and tell me you believe it.\nI personally want to see the sharing economy grow to become the dominant global economic model in the world, because of the social and economic benefits which are built-in, because of the distributed wealth, control, and power which it represents. It has the possibility of transforming the world for the better. So if you want that too, especially if you’d like to see members champion it for themselves, rather than the usual suspects, come and see me afterwards and I can tell you how you can help. Or talk to [Leah](https://www.taskrabbit.com/about), who is the founder of [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/) and Fred from [blablacar](http://blablacar.com) or [Lisa Gansky](http://lisagansky.com/). We can all tell you a little more about it. So Vive La Revolution, and thank you very much. When all jobs are Taskrabbit jobs, how does anyone earn a living?\nAppendix Here’s that table of Peers.org partners.

Whether it\u0026rsquo;s source code, text, artistic works, or government data, some see the open digital commons as an ethical alternative to corporate production, while others believe that sharing and profit go together like wine and cheese. And now, as massively open online courses bring the rhetoric of digital openness to education and Web-based startups are making it easy to share apartments and cars and unused parking spaces and jobs, the seeds have been planted for a sharing economy whose flowering is welcomed both by idealists who value authenticity, sustainability and community sharing over commodity ownership and by venture capitalists looking to make their next fortune. Strange bedfellows.\nCities have long been sites of commons and commerce: full of trade and private enterprise but shaped by parks and streetscapes, neighborhoods and rhythms of daily life that grow from non-commodified sharing. In his 2012 book Rebel Cities, David Harvey observes how, in cities, \u0026ldquo;people of all sorts and classes mingle \u0026hellip; to produce a common of perpetually changing and transitory life,\u0026rdquo; from the irrepressible energy of Manhattan to the café culture of Rome to Barcelona\u0026rsquo;s distinctive architecture to the symbolic meaning of modern Berlin. Yes, by 2009, volunteers had spent a hundred million hours building Wikipedia, but cities put this dramatic number into perspective: Every year the citizens of Canada alone volunteer roughly 20 Wikipedias for hospitals and children\u0026rsquo;s sports, for charities and the arts \u0026mdash; the equivalent of more than a million full-time jobs in a population of 30 million \u0026mdash; and there is no reason to believe that the count is complete or that Canada is exceptional.\nThe similarities between urban and digital worlds are not incidental. Both are cultural spaces, and cultural spaces have always been iceberg-like. Above the surface, market forces and state interventions; beneath, a mass of noncommercial activity organized, at least in part, as open commons. But while digital entrepreneurs look to the \u0026ldquo;Internet\u0026rsquo;s way of working\u0026rdquo; to disrupt the bricks and mortar of our cities, urban experiences have sober lessons for the digerati if they will listen: The relationship between commons and commerce is fraught with contradictions. Harvey never once mentions computer technology in his book, but his reflections on cities make a compelling case that money-making and sharing are far from natural allies, and that the role of openness must be questioned if commons-based production is to be a real alternative.\nThe economics of culture are those of monopolistic competition. Each and every cultural work is a unique creation and, like other unique goods, they offers the prospect of \u0026ldquo;monopoly rents\u0026rdquo; for any who can corner the market on that work. Open commons are themselves cultural works, and while the tending of commons is collective and non-commodified by definition, the commons itself is a magnet for private capital. As Harvey points out, \u0026ldquo;the common, even \u0026mdash; and particularly \u0026mdash; when it cannot be enclosed, can always be traded upon \u0026hellip; the ambience and attractiveness of a city \u0026hellip; is a collective product of its citizens [but] it is the tourist trade that commercially capitalizes upon that common.\u0026rdquo;\nSo a non-commercial common attracts commercial capital, but is this a problem? After all, open commons are not scarce resources, prone to depletion like clean water or ocean fish stocks. Your enjoyment of a city park or a downloaded song does not hinder me from enjoying the same. What turns the contradiction into a tragedy is that private capital tends to destroy the qualities that attracted it in the first place. While commons and commerce can never be completely disentangled, it is large-scale capital that is most damaging, and it is the commitment to openness that blocks off ways to prevent the damage.\nPrivate capital damages open commons through three mechanisms. It erodes the common, it alienates the community that tends the common, and distorts the essential nature of the common.\nNeighborhood diversity is an open commons prone to erosion. Harvey writes: \u0026ldquo;A community group that struggles to maintain ethnic diversity in its neighborhood and protect against gentrification may suddenly find its property prices (and taxes) rising as real estate agents market the ‘character\u0026rsquo; of their neighborhood to the wealthy as multicultural, street-lively, and diverse. By the time the market has done its destructive work, not only have the original residents been dispossessed of that common which they had created (often being forced out by rising rents and property taxes), but the common itself becomes so debased as to be unrecognizable.\u0026rdquo;\nCapital homogenizes even as it demands uniqueness. For a global tourist industry to profit from a city\u0026rsquo;s special qualities it must fit that city into its worldwide operations. Hotel chains build standardized hotels, charter companies demand standardized airports, marketing departments seek messages that resonate around the world. The more distinct a city\u0026rsquo;s culture, the more pressure to squeeze it into the homogenizing templates of global tourism and global trade.\nIn the digital world, sharing-economy sites such as Yelp or TripAdvisor are built on reputation systems, which are digital commons prone to erosion. The value of these systems is their trustworthiness, so the work of tending them must be non-commercial: payments for ratings automatically tarnish the integrity of the system. But once the reputation commons has become sufficiently valuable, the temptation for hotel owners, visitors, and others to game the system for private gain becomes significant. A restaurant rating placed by a competitor restaurant is not easily identified, and so disputes proliferate as reputation systems become more widely used. It is up to the site owners to handle the erosion.\nSadly, the approach of some \u0026ldquo;sharing economy\u0026rdquo; companies is to ignore the problem. TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer dismissed the issue of reputation gaming, saying, \u0026ldquo;One or two phony reviews: who gives a shit?\u0026rdquo; Brian Chesky of apartment rental service AirBnB claims that when it comes to screening apartments, \u0026ldquo;It turns out that cities can\u0026rsquo;t screen as well as technologies can screen. Companies have these magical things called reputation systems.\u0026rdquo; But reputation systems are not magic.\nThe importance of occasional bad reviews is not immediately obvious and varies from context to context. A few bad outcomes completely break some regimes (there is a reason the supply of heart surgeons is not governed by open recommendation systems); for others, such as the entries in Wikipedia, scattered inaccuracies are less important. Accommodation sites have had their share of damage, misuse, and rape, but Chesky and Kaufer emphasize the large number of successful transactions on their systems, gauging their success by the average user experience.\nBut incumbent licensing regimes, so disparaged by sharing-economy advocates, are evaluated differently and with good reason. The severe consequences of extreme incidents lead, over time, to demands for rules that are stricter than crowd-based ratings. The value of the system is determined not by the average but by the worst possible user experience. So far, there is no sign that sharing-economy sites are taking serious measures to treat the rare calamities with the central importance they deserve: The commercial incentives of sharing-economy entrepreneurs make them bad stewards of the reputation-system commons on which they rely.\nHarvey writes that, in co-opting the uniqueness of an open common, capital \u0026ldquo;produces widespread alienation and resentment among the cultural producers who experience first-hand the appropriation and exploitation of their creativity and their political commitments to the benefits of others.\u0026rdquo; Many digital commoners have experienced such an alienation moment, a realization that the common they thought they were tending is, in reality, a private estate, made green and fertile with voluntary labor and then sold lock, stock, and barrel to the highest bidder.\nWoody Guthrie wrote one of the great commons songs: \u0026ldquo;This Land Is Your Land.\u0026rdquo; After Guthrie\u0026rsquo;s death, his daughter Nora entrusted piles of his previously unheard lyrics to radical musician Billy Bragg, who put them to music and turned them into a pair of successful albums in the 1990s. When entrepreneur Michael Birch was putting together social network Bebo.com in 2006, he reached out to Bragg, who \u0026mdash; frustrated by the music industry\u0026rsquo;s treatment of musicians \u0026mdash; gave him advice on how to build an \u0026ldquo;artist-centered environment.\u0026rdquo; But the two \u0026ldquo;ignored the elephant in the room: the issue of whether he ought to consider paying some kind of royalties to the artists.\u0026rdquo; Bebo was to be a common after all, and the tending of commons must be done in a sharing, non-commodified way. In 2008, Birch sold Bebo.com to AOL, pocketing an estimated $600 million. The sale led Bragg to write that \u0026ldquo;if young musicians are to have a chance of enjoying a fruitful career, then we need to establish the principle of artists\u0026rsquo; rights throughout the Internet \u0026mdash; and we need to do it now.\u0026rdquo; This site, it turns out, is not your site.\nWhole online communities have experienced their own similar alienation moments. Goodreads, a social space for book lovers, was sold to Amazon, triggering an angry backlash among members whose voluntary contributions built much of the site\u0026rsquo;s value. Academic reference manager Mendeley, which long employed a rhetoric of openness, alienated its user base by selling itself to Elsevier, a company with a reputation for resisting open-access publication at every turn. Undeterred, Mendeley still pronounces that its \u0026ldquo;real power lies in what it does with the collective data from users.\u0026rdquo; Tumblr\u0026rsquo;s owner David Karp may not be \u0026ldquo;about the money,\u0026rdquo; and the owners of Zipcar may believe that their company is \u0026ldquo;about the people who make it a reality: a team that works hard, members who believe, and organizations that are making conscious decisions for the future.\u0026rdquo; Nonetheless, they didn\u0026rsquo;t mind selling out to Yahoo and Avis, respectively, and alienating their commoners when the price was right. Early collaborative sites like IMDB (another property of Amazon) and CDDB (now owned by Sony Corporation) also turned out to be not commons but private estates, tended by sharecroppers.\nTechno-optimists tend to credit technology alone for fostering digital commons and downplay the nontechnical work of many commoners. In his book Cognitive Surplus, Clay Shirky highlighted Couchsurfing, a site where young global travelers can arrange to visit and host each other, as a healthy digital commons. Couchsurfing started life as couchsurfing.org, not couchsurfing.com; even the code that ran the site was provided by the Couchsurfers themselves. But the site did have owners, and in August 2011, they incorporated and accepted $7.6 million in venture funding. As the company\u0026rsquo;s market value has grown, the Couchsurfing community has deteriorated. A long-time Couchsurfer laments the days of \u0026ldquo;art gatherings, bonfires, a weekly meet up at a bar, café gatherings, potlucks,\u0026rdquo; now lost.\nThe community\u0026rsquo;s former strength turned out to have little to do with technology. As a commenter at Quora writes:\n The old Couchsurfing thrived with a very haphazard and underfunded management structure precisely because local volunteers around the world believed they were part of a cause bigger than profit. Local collectives were highly tied to their local communities \u0026hellip; The technical architecture of the new systems is much better, but paradoxically the ‘professional\u0026rsquo; product development process fixes things that were broken on purpose. In other words, Couchsurfing evolved around certain quirks and inefficient processes that actually became critical to the health of the social trust platform.\n Over 5000 Couchsurfing members have joined the forum We are Against CS becoming a for-profit corporation.\nContrast Couchsurfing with Hostelling International, a venerable network of national youth hostelling organizations that has remained resolutely nonprofit. Over 100 years old, it is still going strong and \u0026ldquo;currently provides 35 million overnight stays a year through more than 4,000 hostels in over 80 countries.\u0026rdquo; Some people do support themselves through the commons of hostels \u0026mdash; some work in the hosteling organizations, others are paid to run hostels themselves \u0026mdash; but it\u0026rsquo;s orders of magnitude away from the sudden injection of millions of venture-capital dollars.\nAs capital is attracted to a successful common, so the nature of the common itself becomes a matter for dispute. In his analysis of cities, Harvey turns again to conflict between the tourist industry and residents over the shared meaning of an urban space: \u0026ldquo;The initial erasure of all mention of the slave trade in the reconstruction of Albert Dock in Liverpool generated protests on the part of the excluded population of Caribbean background.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, after reunification, Berliners were caught between the frying pan of a globalized aesthetic (the \u0026ldquo;Disneyfication of the Berlin Wall\u0026rdquo;) and the fire of a \u0026ldquo;parochial nationalism,\u0026rdquo; with the potential for \u0026ldquo;a virulent rejection of foreigners and immigrants.\u0026rdquo; Capital, Harvey argues, wades into the culture wars to pursue the monopoly rents at stake in commons, making \u0026ldquo;interventions in the field of culture, history, heritage, aesthetics, and meanings.\u0026rdquo;\nDigital commons are subject to similar distortions. The nature of Linux, which famously started as an amateur hobby project, has been changed by the private capital it attracted. Independent contributors now make fewer than 12% of the changes to the kernel; the bulk of the changes come from developers employed in the hundreds of corporations that build businesses on the Linux commons. In an introductory video, the Linux Foundation explicitly acknowledges the corporatization of the effort, explaining that Linux is \u0026ldquo;built collaboratively, across companies, geographies, and markets.\u0026rdquo; Reflecting this shift, the operating system is no longer primarily for individual users who wish to control their computing environment. Instead, its major uses are in consumer electronics products (including phones), enterprise data centers, financial trading systems, and the massive data centers of the Web 2.0 giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Once a challenger to capitalist modes of production, Linux is now an integral part of them.\nSo capital erodes, alienates, and distorts efforts to build value on non-commodified sharing, and openness demands that capital is given unfettered access to the commons. Are digital commons and urban commons doomed to feed the hand that bites them?\nPerhaps not. Among all the contradictions of the commons, Harvey identifies one that provides grounds for hope. The search for monopoly rents on commons \u0026ldquo;leads global capital to value local initiatives \u0026mdash; indeed, in certain respects, the more distinctive and, in these times, the more transgressive the initiative, the better \u0026hellip; It can even support (though cautiously and often nervously) transgressive cultural practices because this is one way in which to be original, creative, and authentic, as well as unique.\nCapital cannot afford to eliminate the uniqueness of a particular commons entirely. Harvey argues that this contradiction provides an opportunity for radical movements to build around urban commons, that the urban commons can still be \u0026ldquo;spaces of hope for the construction of \u0026hellip; a vibrant anti-commodification politics: one in which the progressive forces of cultural production and transformation can seek to appropriate and undermine the forces of capital rather than the other way round.\u0026rdquo; Some would see the eruption of protest in Turkey, sparked by the redevelopment of a park near Istanbul\u0026rsquo;s Taksim Square, as an example of such politics.\nIn the digital world, limiting openness is one way to restrict the encroachment of capital and to maintain digital commons as alternative spaces. Like urban commons, digital commons can be spaces of hope, but only if the contradictory relationship between commons and commerce is acknowledged and addressed, if the destructive influence of capital can be limited, and if some of the accepted wisdom around digital commons is challenged \u0026mdash; including the unquestioning acceptance of \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; as a virtue.\n","date":1372132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"569e4a1fb85cc7f498e2958203e70a7d","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/publication/openwide/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/openwide/","section":"publication","summary":"Markdown Reprinted from The New Inquiry.\nIn cities and on the Web, distinctive shared spaces attract private capital, which erodes the very qualities that make them unique\nSince the earliest days of Linux and of Wikipedia, conflicting attitudes to profit have co-existed with a commitment to digital sharing.

In brief, the Apache Foundation is hosting the Accumulo project. Accumulo is software created by the NSA and handed to Apache, and it is at the heart of the NSA's surveillance technology stack. Now that we know about the use of the technology, Apache has the opportunity to distance itself from the NSA surveillance scandal, and should do so.  How should we think about the role of Apache in the NSA surveillance scandal? Perhaps a good place to look is the work of respected open internet advocates like the OpenNet Initiative. So let\u0026rsquo;s do that.\nA couple of years ago Helmin Noman and Jillian York of the OpenNet Initiative published a bulletin called West Censoring East: The Use of Western Technologies by Middle East Censors, 2010-2011. The bulletin documented network filtering of the internet by national governments, and \u0026ldquo;the use of American- and Canadian-made software for the purpose of government-level filtering in the Middle East and North Africa\u0026rdquo;. The goal of the report was to inform a \u0026ldquo;genuine discussion of the ethics and practice of providing national censorship technology and services\u0026rdquo;. Just to be clear, and for what little it is worth, the report seems admirable to me. The ethical stances it takes were reiterated by Rebecca MacKinnon when she wrote about it last year in her influential book \u0026ldquo;The Consent of the Networked\u0026rdquo;. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting now is to read the report, read the ethical stances it takes regarding the provision of services by Western companies to authoritarian actions by national governments, and apply those lessons to Apache and the NSA. The parallels are, I hope, obvious.\nThe report concludes that \u0026ldquo;Western companies are playing a role in the national politics of many countries around the world. By making their software available to the regimes, they are potentially taking sides against citizens and activists who are prevented from accessing and disseminating content thanks in part to filtering software.\u0026rdquo; The authors complain that \u0026ldquo;companies appear to have done little to curb the use of their tools–if not offering them outright for that purpose–for government-level censorship. These companies seem not to have adopted policies and procedures to safeguard freedom of expression in the event that states rather than parents and schools use their tools, as their products are being openly used by several state-run ISPs to limit what citizens can and cannot access online.\u0026rdquo; The final sentence states that \u0026ldquo;Such companies must recognize the role their tools play in the international landscape and set forth policies that protect Internet users\u0026rsquo; right to free expression–or at least put them on record about the role that they play.\u0026rdquo;\nThe technologies that the companies are providing are general purpose technologies: almost everyone would agree that internet filtering technologies have valid uses by parents and schools, for example. It\u0026rsquo;s not the technology itself that is offensive, at least to anyone who is not happy with the idea of kindergarten kids stumbling across violent pornographic images. It\u0026rsquo;s the relationship between the companies and their customers: the companies are providing a service, knowing the use to which it is going to be put. The report expects companies to think about the use of their tools and to take action to prevent them being used in ways that curb freedoms. It expects companies to limit the use of their tools.\nThe role of Apache as the host of the NSA-initiated Accumulo project is directly parallel to the role of western companies providing filtering software that is used by authoritarian regimes to curb freedom of speech. So, in the light of the OpenNet report, how would the continued hosting of Accumulo look?\n Is Apache providing a service to the NSA? Yes it is. Some people have been telling me that it\u0026rsquo;s not, or that it is but it\u0026rsquo;s unimportant. Both of which seem positively bizarre to me. The NSA took a deliberate decision, after developing Accumulo, that the best way forward was to open source it and look to a private vendor (sqrrl) to continue to provide a distribution that matches their needs. Apache is instrumental in carrying forward that plan.\n The NSA could get their software some other way. This is irrelevant. The OpenNet Report does not let McAfee off the hook because Symantec provides a similar service, and we should not let Apache off the hook either.\n The Accumulo software is general purpose: does that matter? No it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. First, it\u0026rsquo;s not that general purpose: it\u0026rsquo;s not like lightbulbs, it is general purpose data collection and data analysis software in the middle of a controversy over data collection and data analysis, and it\u0026rsquo;s general purpose for anyone who has a data centre and a few petabytes of data to process, and who requires detailed access controls over who can see that. That\u0026rsquo;s not very general. Second, Apache now knows the uses to which the software is being put, just like the companies providing software to the governments of the Middle East knew how their software was being used once OpenNet reported on it.\n Why go after Apache, when they are one of the good guys? Because their declared mandate and their broad membership makes it more likely that they will take a stand. It\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;going after Apache\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s getting Apache to do the right thing. It won\u0026rsquo;t stop the NSA but it limits the breadth of collaboration. I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly think of Apache as \u0026ldquo;one of the good guys\u0026rdquo; because the whole good guys/bad guys way of thinking seems to lead naturally to double standards, but I\u0026rsquo;m not out to get them, I just hope they do the right thing now they see how their efforts are being used.\n  Especially for people outside the USA, putting pressure on an international organization seems a useful way to go. If anyone is interested in taking this up, maybe we can put together a petition at least.

The NSA Boundless Informant data-mining tool proclaims that it \u0026ldquo;leverages FOSS technology\u0026rdquo;, specifically the Hadoop File System, MapReduce (perhaps built on the Apache Accumulo project, which was created by the NSA and contributed to the Apache Foundation), and CloudBase.\nThese are just the most recent examples: the NSA holds Open Source industry Days, like this one last year; it developed the SELinux mechanisms for supporting access control security policies that has been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel since version 2.6. There\u0026rsquo;s a good chance that the NSA\u0026rsquo;s huge new data center in Bluffdale, Utah, which Appelbaum describes at the beginning of his talk, is running open source SELinux software on every computer.\nAnd beyond the NSA, the new set of \u0026ldquo;Big Data\u0026rdquo; technologies associated with data acquisition and analysis has strong open source roots. These are the file systems, data storage systems and data-processing systems built to manage data sets that span so many disks that routine failure of servers is expected, and tolerance for such failure must be built into the system. While much of the initiative came from proprietary systems built at the web giants (Google File System, Google Big Table, Amazon Dynamo), the open source implementations of Hadoop File System, Hadoop Map Reduce, and databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra are becoming the industry norm. Surveillance is as much an open source phenomenon as a closed source one.\nThese are all well-known facts, but maybe they need to be restated. Let me be clear: I\u0026rsquo;m not reversing Appelbaum\u0026rsquo;s claim. There is a great deal of closed source software around the surveillance and internet control landscape as well. And (full disclaimer), my salary is paid by (but I do not speak for) a company that mainly makes its money off closed source software, so I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming a moral high ground here. But to trumpet free and open source software as an alternative to the surveillance systems it has helped to build is nothing but wishful thinking.\nDate: 2013-06-10 Mon.

Each event starts with five-minute lead-ins from the panel members. Some of the panellists are real experts who know more than I do about open data, but \u0026quot;in for a penny, in for a pound\u0026quot;: so on Tuesday I'll use my five minutes to argue against standards (and especially universal standards), and on Thursday I'll argue that openness is an idea that has outlived its usefulness.  Here are notes for Thursday\u0026rsquo;s opening remarks, which will be familiar to regular readers. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll have to cut them down a bit for time.\nWe all know that the ideas and actions around \u0026ldquo;Open Government Data\u0026rdquo; have created a very wide umbrella that covers many different agendas. It covers civil liberties campaigners, civic activists, startups, politicians from across the political spectrum, and major international corporations. And we all know that those agendas and groups are a bit uncomfortable being in such close proximity. But like \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; is something that everyone can agree on, and it\u0026rsquo;s served to paper over the cracks between these disparate interests.\nUnfortunately, it looks to me increasingly as if the language of transparency, the language of non-commercial civic engagement, and the romantic language of rebellion are being used to provide an exciting and appealing facade for an agenda that has nothing to do with transparency, nothing to do with civic participation, and a lot to do with traditional power politics and profit making.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to get out from under the umbrella and to acknowledge that we are in different camps with different goals. And to do that we need to get rid of the idea that \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; is an unalloyed virtue.\nHere are two examples of how openness is being misused.\nThe first is about openness and transparency, and it\u0026rsquo;s from Canada where I live and of which I am a citizen. The Government of Canada has an active open data program. It\u0026rsquo;s a member of the Open Government Partnership, now chaired by Francis Maude; if you look in Capgemini\u0026rsquo;s recent white paper on The Open Data Economy you\u0026rsquo;ll see Canada together with the UK, the USA, France, and Australia as one of the government trendsetters. Last October Jonathan Rosenberg of Google posted an article on the company web site titled \u0026ldquo;The Future is Open\u0026rdquo;, in which he wrote:\nClaims to governmental transparency are one thing – moves like the one Canada made recently, with its formal Open Government Declaration, are another. The document recognises that open is an active state, not a passive one – it's not just that data should be free to citizens whenever possible, but that an active 'culture of engagement' should be the goal of such measures. So three cheers for open government Canada? Of course, that\u0026rsquo;s only one side of the story. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of other events in Canada around openness and transparency.\n Library and Archives Canada, which is the equivalent of the British Library, has seen its acquisition and lending programs cut back. Its historical item spending has been cut from $385K (\u0026lsquo;08-\u0026lsquo;09) to $12K (\u0026lsquo;12-\u0026lsquo;13) as its overall budget has been cut from $173M to $108M. (Toronto Star, March 10, 2013)\n The Government is \u0026ldquo;muzzling its scientists\u0026rdquo; according to the BBC. A protocol introduced in 2008 requires that \u0026ldquo;all interview requests for scientists employed by the government must first be cleared by officials. A decision as to whether to allow the interview can take several days, which can prevent government scientists commenting on breaking news stories. Sources say that requests are often refused and when interviews are granted, government media relations officials can and do ask for written questions to be submitted in advance and elect to sit in on the interview.\u0026rdquo;\n Cuts to Statistics Canada: in response to yet another wave of cuts, a group of concerned academics recently wrote that \u0026ldquo;For many of us, it started with the census. In a controversial move, our government switched from a mandatory to a voluntary census in the summer of 2010. The former Statistics Canada chief, the media and the research community reacted with shock and largely opposed the change to no avail … We have now halted the collection and analysis of our most informative longitudinal information on our labour force, on the workplace, on health and health care, and on child well-being. Add to this our universal census of the population. How might Canada expect to meet the policy challenges of the future when we no longer have the ability to understand where we are today?\u0026rdquo; (University of Manitoba)\n The move to packaging legislation in so-called \u0026ldquo;Omnibus bills\u0026rdquo; that cover many different initiatives in a single, perhaps several hundred page, package has severely curtailed public debate over new initiatives and major legislative changes.\n  If there\u0026rsquo;s a message here, it\u0026rsquo;s just that openness cannot be measured in bytes. And if someone _is_ measuring it in bytes, then you have to wonder what the motives are. So the CapGemini report (above) looks at the Open Data Economy simply by comparing the open data portals that each nation has produced. This is datawashing.\nA brief second story. If you look at what kind of new economic possibilities are being promoted by open data, CapGemini highlights Zillow, a Real Estate Advertising network based in California, which uses open tax data, county records, and home-for-sale listings. If there is one industry who has proved able to use the language of openness and disruption to great effect, it\u0026rsquo;s the Silicon Valley venture capital industry. But whereas when Linus Torvalds started Linux \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; was a tool for individuals to build something to compete with large enterprises, now \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; is a tool for large enterprises with a lot of funding to hammer smaller non-profit groups. We hear the language of openness and disruption coming in education, where Coursera and Udacity can go to Davos and paint themselves as radicals, to Uber and AirBnB, whosee millionaires claim to be part of a \u0026ldquo;sharing economy\u0026rdquo; disrupting nightmare overlords like the Bed \u0026amp; Breakfast industry or the taxi cartels. We are seeing the emergence of a winner-take-all economy in which small organizations and small businesses are severely handicapped against those with capital behind them. All in the name of openness.\nIf we see civic participation as an end in itself, which I do, then we need to treat civic computing like a cultural activity. That means we need to build some barriers to protect civic-scale groups from large companies who have advantages of scale, and who can deliver \u0026ldquo;efficiency\u0026rdquo; but not participation. Tony Ageh of the BBC, speaking at this conference, describes a vision of public domain data as a \u0026ldquo;commons\u0026rdquo; but I think he gets it wrong. A commons is not a free-for-all, where anyone can come and take anything they want. A commons suggests a group of people who all have an interest in maintaining and cultivating a shared resource, and that suggests limits to access from outside. There is room for a number of models of providing mixed access to data, from non-commercial licenses, to closed partnerships between cities and citizen groups, to non-standard formats for sharing that reflect the quirks of individual cities and groups. Each of these seems to break the idea of \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo; in one way or another, but we should be prepared to do so. Openness in and of itself is not enough to hold together a worthwhile coalition and it\u0026rsquo;s time to get over it.\n","date":1363371545,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"194e818b2aad8453c62527fc604a3749","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/futureeverything-notes/","publishdate":"2013-03-15T18:19:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/futureeverything-notes/","section":"post","summary":"I'm really looking forward to being part of [FutureEverything](http://futureeverything.org/) in Manchester next week, where I'll be a panellist at [Open Data Manchester](http://opendatamanchester.org.uk/2013/02/27/open-data-manchester-special-the-promises-and-perils-of-open-data/) on Tuesday and at [Policies and Politics of Open Data](http://futureeverything.org/summit/conference/sessions/policies-politics-of-open-data/) on Thursday.

I love Jane Jacobs. \u0026ldquo;Austrian\u0026rdquo; economists with whom I disagree, like Alex Tabarrok, love Jane Jacobs. You probably love Jane Jacobs. Steven Johnson says he loves Jane Jacobs in his recent book _Future Perfect _ \u0026ndash; __but so does Evgeny Morozov at the beginning of _To Save Everything, Click Here, _and Morozov is arguing _against _Johnson. Someone has to be getting Jane Jacobs wrong. Much of this essay is an attempt to see why Morozov gets Jacobs right, while Johnson and others are missing something important.\n~ ~ ~\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Evgeny Morozov tells us, he thought that digital technology might be a way to rid the world of autocratic regimes. His disillusionment was channelled into his influential first book, The Net Delusion, a full-on attack on \u0026ldquo;the sheer callousness and utopianism\u0026rdquo; of the \u0026ldquo;Internet Freedom\u0026rdquo; project (p 354).\nThis time around, Morozov\u0026rsquo;s target is much broader, but still centred in the world of digital technologies, and particularly the Internet. He takes aim at the ideologies that have grown up around the Internet, and their many manifestations.\nChapter 7 is typical of the book. Here is a collection of people who record and track their everyday lives online, and then analyze and quantify their existence, from toothbrushing to reading to fecal contents. These \u0026ldquo;datasexuals\u0026rdquo; now have a social movement, of a sort, which they call the \u0026ldquo;Quantified Self\u0026rdquo; movement. It would be easy to dismiss the Quantified Selfers as harmless eccentrics if they did not have a significant presence among the opinion shapers and leading lights of Silicon Valley, and if the mindset they embody was not clearly present, if in moderated form, in the wider digital world, and if the assumptions and goals were not oozing out over the rest of us. From quantifying oneself in a private context it is a short step to the presentation of self through these numbers, and the use of them as a basis for optimization and refinement. So Morozov cites Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, who says that self tracking is a way to \u0026ldquo;acknowledge that you have bugs, that there\u0026rsquo;s new development to do on yourself\u0026rdquo; (237) so that we can algorithmically measure, tweak, and refine ourselves and our self-presentation to the world.\nFrom here it is just one more short step to the buying and selling of our personal data: to insurers in return for lower premiums, to advertisers in return for better deals. Our personal data becomes a new \u0026ldquo;asset class\u0026rdquo; and executives respond by \u0026ldquo;trying to shift the focus [of debate] from purely privacy to what we call property rights\u0026rdquo; (235). New social pressures emerge as the digitizers follow their path of bits, algorithms and markets (career counsellors now routinely recommend that building a strong presence on LinkedIn is a route to a better job), and we can replace debates about privacy with reassurances about personal choice. \u0026ldquo;Privacy is mostly an illusion, but you\u0026rsquo;ll have as much of it as you want to pay for\u0026rdquo; says Kevin Kelly (236). New companies emerge to optimize our self-presentation on the web (reputation.com), new norms emerge as \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re going out with someone, and they don\u0026rsquo;t have a Facebook profile, you should be suspicious\u0026rdquo; (Slate\u0026rsquo;s Farhad Manjoo, quoted on p. 239). Why would you not share your real-time blood alcohol levels with your employer if you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hide? (240).\nThe impact of the digital on our lives is such that, while the social consequences of self-tracking seem immense, they are just one thread among many of the digital revolution. In separate chapters, Morozov investigates new developments in policing, arts and culture, politics, government, social engineering, civic life, health, the workplace, and the increasingly designed, architected environments in which we live. There is no aspect of life that isn\u0026rsquo;t ready to be tweaked, nudged, hacked and filtered into optimal performance.\nHow to respond to such a flood of changes? One is tempted to define oneself by an attitude to digital technologies themselves: to be unequivocally pro- or anti-technology. But to reject or to accept technology wholesale has no future: wholesale rejection entails rejection, not just of integrated circuits, but of the people connected by them: shaping the use of technology lies not in the realm of individual choice, but of social choice. Wholesale acceptance seems fatalistic – abandoning the possibility of having any say in the forces shaping the societies in which we live.\nMorozov undertakes two projects, one successfully and one less so. The first is to provide a framework in which to think about the new inventions that are being sold to us, and the patterns of thought behind them. Morozov identifies a twin-tracked ideology behind the inventions and inventiveness of the digital world. One track is \u0026ldquo;Internet-centrism\u0026rdquo; – the practice of \u0026ldquo;taking a model of how the Internet works and applying it to other endeavours\u0026rdquo;. Writers have imbued the Internet with \u0026ldquo;a way of working\u0026rdquo;; it has a \u0026ldquo;grain\u0026rdquo; to which we must adapt; it has a culture, a \u0026ldquo;way it is meant to be used\u0026rdquo;, and it comes with a mythology in which iTunes and Wikipedia become models to think about the future of politics, and Zynga is a model for civic engagement (15). The second track is \u0026ldquo;solutionism\u0026rdquo;: the recasting of social situations as problems with definite solutions; processes to be optimized (23).\nMorozov does a fine job of articulating Internet-centrism and solutionism as two facets of a single Silicon Valley ideology, whose followers include the Valley\u0026rsquo;s software industry leaders, venture capitalists, conferences and \u0026ldquo;thought leaders\u0026rdquo;, as an evolution of the \u0026ldquo;Cyberselfish\u0026rdquo; ideology identified a decade ago by Paulina Borsook. The common assumptions, shared biases, and individualistic predilictions give a cohesiveness and homogeneity to the new ideas and inventions, actively constructing and shaping the digital environment from which they claim to draw their inspiration. The insistence on \u0026ldquo;disrupting\u0026rdquo; our social and environmental lives; the idea that the solutions inspired by and enabled by the Internet mark a clean break from historical patterns, a never-before-seen opportunity – these mean that the only lessons to learn from history are those of previous technological disruptions. The view of society as an institution-free network of autonomous individuals practicing free exchange makes the social sciences, with the exception of economics, irrelevant. What\u0026rsquo;s left is engineering, neuroscience, an understanding of incentives (in the narrowly utilitarian sense): just right for those whose intellectual predispositions are to algorithms, design, and data structures. Morozov argues that these orthodoxies have had \u0026ldquo;a corrosive effect on public discourse and on reform projects\u0026rdquo; (16) and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to argue otherwise.\nMorozov\u0026rsquo;s approach to unpicking the hidden assumptions of solutionism, and the unpalatable consequences of its application, is impressive but less successful. In order to avoid a blanket technopessimism he makes two moves. The first is to adopt a broadly social constructionist approach to the world of digital technologies. The Internet does not shape us, it is shaped by the society in which it is growing. He is with Raymond Williams, against Marshall McLuhan. His stance here is blunt: he refuses to see \u0026ldquo;the Internet\u0026rdquo; as an agent of change, for good or bad. \u0026ldquo;The Internet\u0026rdquo; is not a cause; it does not explain things, it is the thing that needs to be explained. Chapter 2 is titled The Internet Tells Us Nothing (Because It Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Actually Exist).\nThe second, more surprising move, is to adopt a critique that was first described in a pejorative sense by Albert Hirschmann. \u0026ldquo;In his influential book The Rhetoric of Reaction, Hirschmann argued that all progressive reforms usually attract conservative criticisms that build on one of the following three themes: perversity (whereby the proposed intervention only worsens the problem at hand), futility (whereby the intervention yields no results whatsoever), and jeopardy (whereby the intervention threatens to undermine some previous, hard-earned accomplishment)\u0026rdquo; (6). Morozov does not see himself as a conservative, but instead places himself in the tradition of other thinkers who have stood against programs of organized efficiency; \u0026ldquo;Jane Jacobs attacks on the arrogance of urban planning, Michael Oakeshott\u0026rsquo;s rebellion against rationalists in all walks of human existence, Hans Jonas\u0026rsquo;s impatience with the cold comfort of cybernetics; and, more recently, James Scott\u0026rsquo;s concern with how states have forced what he calls \u0026lsquo;legibility\u0026rsquo; on their subjects\u0026rdquo; (7). The list is an interesting one because, as I mentioned at the beginning, it features the same cast of characters that the solutionists \u0026ndash; those whom Morozov opposes so implacably \u0026ndash; routinely invoke as their own inspirations.\nThe Hirschmann framework provides Morozov with a recipe for how to think about the many solutionist initiatives he tackles, and many of the passages in the book have a similar structure. Let\u0026rsquo;s return to self-tracking for a moment. Morozov\u0026rsquo;s first line of critique is Hirschmann\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;jeopardy\u0026rdquo;: he invokes the \u0026lsquo;technostructuralists\u0026rsquo; to ask not just what individual choices self-tracking offers, but to ask how it changes the environment we inhabit. A decision not to share becomes a tacit acknowledgement that you have something to hide. The danger is that \u0026ldquo;if you are well and well-off, self-monitoring will only make things better for you. If you are none of these things, the personal prospectus could make your life much more difficult, with higher insurance premiums, fewer discounts, and limited employment prospects\u0026rdquo; (240). It erodes privacy, the ability to make a clean start, and erodes risk-taking behaviour given the consequences of failure. A second line of critique is to ask what, as our quantifiable aspects become the focus of attention, is missing in the quantified portrait that emerges: what intangible aspects of ourselves become invisible. Do these numbers, he asks, miss meaning? Where do ethics and aesthetics go to in a world of numbers? Morozov surveys the centuries-old debates over the virtues and perils of quantification. Here the critique stumbles, as Morozov rolls out thinker after thinker in a parade of reasons to doubt the benefits of quantification. From Nietzsche to Nussbaum, from nutritionism (the quantification of food) to water-metering and the evolution of clothes-washing norms, to the benefits of friction and dissonance in our everyday lives, there is no doubt he covers an impressive amount of ground, but the argument is scattershot; disjoint. The end result is an erudite and widely-sourced list of the ways in which technologies may lead to bad outcomes – but it is still a list, and it lacks the force of a strong central thesis behind it.\nThe other chapters follow a similar pattern: the perversity, futility, and jeopardy of solutionist agendas show a breadth of investigation that should shame many of his more populist opponents, and provide valuable contexts in which to think about technological programmes. In particular, his insistence on seeking out historical precedents for today\u0026rsquo;s arguments is a welcome change from the language of \u0026ldquo;rupture\u0026rdquo; that many solutionists prefer.\nIf there is a unified point of view behind the critique, it can be traced back to the \u0026ldquo;anti-solutionists\u0026rdquo; with whom Morozov identifies. Like Morozov and like Steven Johnson, I\u0026rsquo;m a big admirer of Jane Jacobs\u0026rsquo;s Death and Life of Great American Cities, and James Scott\u0026rsquo;s Seeing Like a State: which makes me wonder how can they end up in such different camps. The fault, you will not be surprised to hear, belongs with the solutionists.\nOne of the remarkable insights of computer scientists (and social scientists and natural scientists in the computer age) is an understanding of how great complexity and diversity can be generated by populations of simple agents following simple rules. Just as schools of fish and flocks of starlings create sweeping artistic displays by pursuing simple individual rules, so the rich tapestry of city life emerges from simple everyday interactions. The ideas of network theorists lend themselves to talk of self-organization, non-hierarchical structures, and informational cascades. Computer scientists take ideas such as the \u0026ldquo;Game of Life\u0026rdquo;, the stunning images of fractal shapes, and the rich behaviour of networks to illustrate how complexity arises from simplicity. From spin-glasses in magnets to the sorting and emergence of patterns revealed by Schelling and his intellectual descendants, simple \u0026ldquo;micromotives\u0026rdquo; give rise to surprising and intricate patterns of \u0026ldquo;macrobehaviour\u0026rdquo;. Such agent-based thinking seems at first to mesh perfectly with Jacobs\u0026rsquo;s closely observed studies of city life. She famously focused her piercing, analytical eye on the details of every day life in large cities, and used her observations to challenge and then triumph over the grand visions and arrogance of top-down city planners. It\u0026rsquo;s the bottom-up nature of her approach that inspires: the planners are trying to impose patterns on populations from above but they miss the relationship between the large and the small. It is tempting, then, to take the descriptions of Jacobs\u0026rsquo;s cities and encode them in algorithms: agent-based simulations of the effects of block size on pedestrian traffic patterns seem almost mandated, so obvious a next step do they seem from Jacobs\u0026rsquo;s chapter on the topic.\nYet this step, I increasingly believe, is a mistake. Solutionism is ultimately central planning by another name. The arrogance of the urban planner reappears as the arrogance of the agent-based modeller and the Internet entrepreneur: the plan is still monolithic, but now takes the shape of a network. As Steven Johnson says, when his \u0026ldquo;peer progressives\u0026rdquo; see a social problem, they design a peer network to solve it. But what has happened to the citizens in this network? They have been reduced to dumb followers of simple rules. The richness and complexity – all the interest, in fact – lies in the structure of the network. If the outcome isn\u0026rsquo;t what you want, well tweak the incentives, adjust the topology of the network, provide an additional option for the nodes (sorry, people) to choose from. For all its talk of bottom-up, decentralized thinking, the Internet-centric solutionists end up with an impoverished perspective of individual behaviour.\nJust because complex and rich behaviours can arise from simple rules doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that people are simple beings. Any theory that applies both to murmurations of starlings or spin-glasses of magnetic ions as well as to cities of humans is, almost by definition, missing the distinctive features of human societies. Complexity can arise from simplicity at the small scale, but macro-level complexity also arises from micro-level complexity. The subtle and ill-understood nature of our own needs and interactions will defeat the best efforts of solutionist planning, just has it has defeated those of central planning and of free markets.\nIn his final chapters, Morozov appeals to this particularist view of the world, in which each node of a network is different from others, and in which general solutions don\u0026rsquo;t exist. To discard the importance of the details of our daily interactions, as the solutionists inevitably do, is to inevitably provoke unexpected responses, unintentional side effects, and unanticipated breakdowns of the solutionist schemes. When Brian Chesky of AirBnB complains that there are 30,000 different cities in which he wants to operate, and that it\u0026rsquo;s just not practical to negotiate with each one, he is not designing a bottom-up solution, he is imposing a top-down network. He is demanding that cities become \u0026ldquo;legible\u0026rdquo; in James Scott\u0026rsquo;s terminology, to his overarching (and simplistic) algorithms.\nTo reach for an alternative vision, Morozov looks to artists who have engaged in \u0026ldquo;adversarial design\u0026rdquo; to illustrate the importance of acknowledging micro-level complexity.

On the one hand, we have the rational choice, agent-based approach and on the other we have more traditional sociological approaches based on larger-scale social structures.\nIf you look at some of the key characteristics of the uprisings, it looks like a win for the micro side. Theories, and North African uprisings.\nEvent Micro Macro \nSudden uprising (cascade) \nY \nN   Lack of strong opposition movement \nY \nN   Network technologies \nY \nN    Score \n3 \n0     The single most dramatic thing about the \u0026ldquo;Arab Spring\u0026rdquo; uprisings was their unexpected suddenness. They fit the \u0026ldquo;information cascade\u0026rdquo; models developed by Timur Kuran, Suzanne Lohmann and others to describe the equally dramatic and sudden 1989 uprisings in Eastern Europe. Nothing on the \u0026ldquo;macro\u0026rdquo; side matches the elegant explanation of sudden, discontinuous change given by the micro-theorists.\nRelated to this suddenness is the lack of a strong opposition movement before the uprising. It\u0026rsquo;s not that there was no opposition, but there was nothing of the strength to indicate a coming crisis. The cascade theories have no need, or even place, for organizations or movements: these are population dynamics models, with no structure bigger than the networked individual. Meanwhile, the leading sociological theories deal with movements, organizations, and resource mobilization. Score two to the micro-theorists.\nFinally, we have the role of digital technologies, which segues naturally to network models of society. Talk of information technologies leads equally naturally to a focus on information diffusion across networks, in which increased connectivity lowering barriers to collaboration, discussion, and information sharing. And the macro-theorists again seem to have little on their side to cope with these kinds of ideas.\nIt looks like a shut-out win for the micro-theorists; the language of networks and information replaces the language of social movements and repertoires of performance, and with that comes the inevitable idea that with a new kind of theory we are we seeing a new kind of uprising, in which self-organizing networks based on digital technologies take centre stage…\nBut you will have realized by now that this is a setup for me to argue that there\u0026rsquo;s another way of looking at these events, so let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\nThe key success of micro-level theory is the explanation of cascades, which is a natural consequence of any model that has multiple equilibria. Just because of that success, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to go whole hog and take on board the ideas of information-driven and network-sustained change. I want to argue that we can take the concepts that sociological research has shown to be important, and move them into the realm of rational choice models. And when we do, we not only get population dynamics and cascades, but we also get explanations for several other aspects of dissent and uprisings that networks and information-based theories can\u0026rsquo;t deliver.\nIs there a downside? Of course there is. Behind the scenes, it\u0026rsquo;s often the case that rational choice theorists like long equations while sociologists love long words. Rational choice theorists see the sociologists\u0026rsquo; concepts as fuzzy, while the sociologists see the incentives of rational choice models as simplistic. What I have to offer demands both long equations and long words, and is open to being criticism for being simultaneously simplistic and fuzzy. Ah well.\nFacebook as a \u0026ldquo;free space\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a question. Zeynep Tufekci is a sociologist who was in Egypt right after the January 2011 uprisings, interviewing participants. Here\u0026rsquo;s what she says:\nWhen I was in post-Mubarak Cairo, my hosts kept pointing in amazement to various street corners where fierce political discussions were being held and often whispered, before remembering they could now speak up and adjusting their voice, \"You never saw this. Nobody ever discussed politics openly, ever.\" Then they would pause and add, \"Well, except online, of course. We all discussed politics online.\" So the question is that final sentence. Why is it that, prior to the revolution, people could discuss politics online but not elsewhere? What made \u0026rdquo;online\u0026rdquo; a venue where those discussions could take place? It\u0026rsquo;s not just ease of communication, because if you want to communicate you can stand on a busy street corner – as people were doing when Tufekci visited.\nThe key thing is that communication online was, for some reason, safe, while communication on the street was not. It\u0026rsquo;s not just that communication among like-minded people was possible, but that the \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo; spaces were a venue where such communication did not have the same consequences. Somehow, the speech was hidden from those in power. It was a trusted environment.\nNow while the logic of networks is a good way to explain easy communication, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t lend itself to discussions of trust. Fortunately sociologists have long been aware of the importance of these \u0026ldquo;free spaces\u0026rdquo; in which dissenting voices can communicate. Here are Francesca Polletta and James Jasper in a 2001 paper:\nConcepts of \"submerged networks\", \"halfway houses\", \"free spaces\", \"havens\", \"sequestered social sites\", and \"abeyance structures\" describe institutions removed from the physical and ideological control of those in power, for example the black church before the civil rights movement and literary circles in communist Eastern Europe. Such institutions… represent a \"free space\" in which people can develop counterhegemonic ideas and oppositional identities. So these notions of \u0026ldquo;free spaces\u0026rdquo; have been around for some time and surely fit something about the way that online political discussion worked in Egypt. Free spaces are institutions (in a broad sense of the term) that are not outlawed, but which appeal to outsiders of society rather than to those who identify with the powers-that-be. They manage to be transparent to their members while being opaque to officialdom.\nMore generally, following Charles Tilly and Sidney Tarrow, we can think of institutions in authoritarian states as being of three kinds. Types of institution in authoritarian states\nInstitution High Status Low Status \nPrescribed \nY \nY/N   Tolerated \nN \nY   Forbidden \nN \nN    \n Prescribed institutions are the mainstream and establishment institutions of society. They may include the education system, organizations like the army, and also things like national celebrations. Some of these institutions include people of all levels of status, while some are restricted to high-status individuals and families.\n Tolerated institutions are legal, but their membership is limited to lower-status individuals. In some countries these would include religious institutions associated with minority groups, perhaps some artistic and cultural institutions, and workplace organizations in countries where they can exist outside official control. These are the venues that, according to Polletta and Jasper, can provide spaces for dissent. Obviously there is a wide range of what institutions are tolerated and what are forbidden. North Korea has a lot fewer \u0026ldquo;tolerated\u0026rdquo; institutions than 1980 Poland.\n Forbidden institutions are those that are not permitted in authoritarian societies. Opposition political parties, independent unions, that sort of thing.\n  But how do these institutions become \u0026ldquo;removed from the physical and ideological control of those in power\u0026rdquo;? The answer lies in what Polletta \u0026amp; Jasper call \u0026ldquo;collective identity\u0026rdquo;. Tolerated institutions –whether subcultures, groups, or whatever – build up their own practices to establish autonomy.\nCollective identity is \u0026ldquo;an individual\u0026rsquo;s cognitive, moral, and emotional connection with a broader community, category, practice, or institution.\u0026rdquo; It gets expressed in \u0026ldquo;cultural materials—names, narratives, symbols, verbal styles, rituals, clothing, and so on.\u0026rdquo; And these expressions provide boundary-setting rituals and institutions that separate challengers from those in power, and so can strengthen internal solidarity.\nExamples of \u0026ldquo;free spaces\u0026rdquo; in authoritarian societies abound. In his book Exit-Voice Dynamics and the Collapse of East Germany, Steven Pfaff highlights the importance of some very narrow institutions that he calls \u0026rdquo;Niche society\u0026rdquo;. These are \u0026ldquo;pockets of private life, around home, car and allotment\u0026rdquo; where people could voice their disenchantment and cynicism. A broader form of dissent took place in institutions of youth culture: despite party efforts to establish bands and music venues for German youth, many sought out more alternative forms of music, and clashes took place between fans and police at concerts. Music events are not, at least publicly, political events and so while the events might not be forbidden, you would not find party supporters taking part. Finally, Pfaff notes that \u0026ldquo;Dissent could only take place in gaps in the system of social control that dissidents could exploit. In the GDR this principally meant the churches.\u0026rdquo; Again, churches are an example of an institution that was legal, but which naturally separated society\u0026rsquo;s outsiders from those in power.\nConnecting Identity to Rational Choice? So now we seem to have two separate sets of ideas. On the one hand we have a theory of uprisings that makes no use of sociological concepts. On the other hand, to explain pre-uprising dissent we need to look at sociological ideas such as institutions and identity. Obviously there is a bridge that must be built if we are to connect these seemingly separate theoretical islands. Can the gap be bridged? Well yes it can, thanks to the \u0026ldquo;identity economics\u0026rdquo; work of George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, who argue that identity provides a key motivation for many social situations. They take the concept of identity seriously, and simplify it to fit it into a tractable micro-level model. Identity, they say, has three parts to it.\n First is a set of social categories: for us, those categories are \u0026ldquo;government supporter\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;opponent\u0026rdquo;.\n Next, each of these identities has a set of attributes associated with it. These vary from society to society. Economic status is one, religious or ethnic or gender identities are others.\n And finally, each identity has a set of norms of behavior: in this case we simplify the options to \u0026ldquo;conform\u0026rdquo; to society\u0026rsquo;s expectations or \u0026ldquo;dissent\u0026rdquo;.\n  Individuals then have two choices to make. First, they need to adopt an identity: _G_overnment or _O_pposition? Next, if they are oppositional they need to decide whether to engage in active dissent or to conform to official expectations. If we arrange the population according to status, then those at the lower status choose O (_O_ has a higher utility), and people with higher status choose G. Here is a graph that shows a case where the switchover appears at the mid-point.\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_504\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;450\u0026rdquo;] Utility and identity in an authoritarian society[/caption]\nIn some times and places, no one gives a hoot which identity you adopt, while at other times and places it can be a matter of life or death. I\u0026rsquo;ll call this scaling of the difference between O and G the identity polarization of society, and we\u0026rsquo;ll be needing this concept a lot.\nIdentity is one of the two things we need to explain \u0026ldquo;free spaces\u0026rdquo; but before we go to the other, let\u0026rsquo;s take a short detour. One of the key successes of information-driven rational choice models was the fact that they yield cascades. Can our identity-driven model also give cascades? Funny you should ask…\nIdentity Cascades Here is a cascade.\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_505\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;450\u0026rdquo;] A cascade. The yellow line and the yellow dot are equilibria of the model.[/caption]\nIf you want to know the gory details, including what the \u0026ldquo;hegemony\u0026rdquo; label on the x axis means, you have to go and read the paper. But see that there are two equilibria here. One is a stable authoritarian state, with zero activity (the yellow line at the right) and a high government hegemony. The other is a state in crisis, with a high level of dissent (the yellow dot where the lines cross). And a small change in society can lead to a sudden discontinuous switch from one to the other: a cascade.\nTo generate multiple equilibria you need some form of externality: some way in which one person\u0026rsquo;s actions influence those around them. This model generates cascades by asserting that active dissent increases the identity polarization of society: the more active dissent there is, the more it matters which side you are on. It\u0026rsquo;s not so much an information cascade as an identity cascade.\nAlthough this is a rational choice model, it does not invoke networks, and information is not central to the argument. In most cascade models the cascade is generated by two things:\n active dissent reveals information, about the state of the society or about the beliefs of other people. This is the \u0026ldquo;preference falsification\u0026rdquo; argument.\n there is safety in numbers: the more people protesting, the safer it is to protest.\n  I\u0026rsquo;ve criticized these ideas here, but is there any evidence to suggest that identity does get polarized as a result of dissent? Anecdotally, there is. Here is a Marxist radical speaking about Paris, 1968:\nI was completely surprised by 1968… I had an idea of the revolutionary process and it was nothing like this. I saw students building barricades, but these were people who knew nothing of revolution. They were not even political. There was no organisation, no planning. In the lead-up to 1968, French students were not revolutionaries who had falsified their true preferences in order to conform to society\u0026rsquo;s expectations. What happened was that during the riots, identity (status quo or radical?) became a central issue, and individuals had to decide \u0026ldquo;which side are you on?\u0026rdquo;, and many students switched their identities from mildly status-quo to enthusiastic barricade-builder.\nA switch in identity happens when people are pulled along by those around them. As Dennis Chong (1991) writes of the US Civil Rights movement: \u0026rdquo;friendship and familial, religious, and professional relationships create an array of ongoing exchanges, obligations and expectations that individual.\u0026rdquo;\nIn his book on the fall of the GDR, Steven Pfaff repeatedly invokes the \u0026rdquo;preference falsification\u0026rdquo; model, but he often steps outside it too. In fact, my biased reading of it is that he sometimes resorts to the preference falsification model because of a lack of alternatives, not because the evidence pulls him that way. But when he writes that \u0026ldquo;By 1989 official socialist ideology, along with its clear articulation of the nature of injustice, had become a threat to the system it was meant to legitimate\u0026rdquo; he is talking about a crisis of identity. The crisis served to \u0026ldquo;focus diffuse grievances\u0026rdquo;, uniting \u0026ldquo;a host of disparate concerns into \u0026lsquo;moral anger\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;. This is the crystallization of identities into the two polar choices: \u0026ldquo;Which side are you on?\u0026rdquo;\nThe \u0026ldquo;identity cascade\u0026rdquo; model also makes a closer connection between dynamics and the efforts of protesters. I\u0026rsquo;ll return to this later, but one of the things that protesters do in uprisings is lay claim to the symbols of national identity. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s Salt March or GDR protesters choosing the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country, struggles over the meaning of identity become central at times of crisis. If information revelation was all that were needed, there would be no role for the displays of \u0026ldquo;worthiness, unity, numbers and commitment\u0026rdquo; that characterize political protest. An identity-driven approach makes this link clear, within a rational choice framework.\n(Another nice thing is that within the identity cascade model there is a natural categorization of the kind of events that can precipitate a cascade. A shock to the norms associated with opposition, a change in socio-economic conditions that places more people into the \u0026ldquo;outsider\u0026rdquo; category, or a change in state policy (perestroika) all emerge as triggers for cascades. See the paper for more.)\nFree Spaces and Screening With that diversion over, let\u0026rsquo;s return to the topic of free spaces. How do we get from the language of Polletta and Jasper to the world of rational choice? There is a natural correspondence in the concept of screening: a mechanism that imposes differential costs for two different groups, so that (in a \u0026rdquo;separating\u0026rdquo; equilibrium) one group finds it worthwhile to pay the cost, while the other does not. Here, the identity-driven costs of being a member of \u0026rdquo;tolerated\u0026rdquo; institution screens out those with the status quo (G) identity.\nJust as Akerlof and Kranton simplified identity so that it could be squeezed into a rational choice picture, so we have to simplify the idea of an institution. Henceforth, then, an institution I is characterized by three things:\n Status (x): This is the natural membership of the institution. We can say that the identity of the institution is the optimal identity of an individual with status x\n Breadth (δ): Individuals with status in [x - δ, x + δ] are members of I. The \u0026ldquo;niche society\u0026rdquo; institutions of the GDR have a very narrow breadth, while events such as national celebrations include all of society.\n Membership discrimination (m): Some institutions do not discriminate between the two identities, but some do. A discriminating institution demands a cost of membership for individuals whose identity differs from the identity of the institution.\n  With this idea, you can build a model in which there is a range of institutions that even a strong state will not monitor, because the cost of monitoring is greater than the benefit in terms of dissent that is quieted. These institutions provide the free space for dissent to persist even under conditions of strong government.\nHere are some screening institutions\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_506\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;450\u0026rdquo;] Screening institutions.[/caption]\nThe screening institutions are those inside the lozenge shapes. Along the x axis is the status, so all these institutions are \u0026ldquo;tolerated\u0026rdquo; in that they are entirely within the \u0026ldquo;outsider\u0026rdquo; low-status zone. The broader the reach of the institution (that\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;δ\u0026rdquo; in the graph) the less scope there is for these institutions. Finally, and it\u0026rsquo;s beyond what I can explain in this part, there is a limit to the size of the \u0026ldquo;public sphere\u0026rdquo; that also limits the available institutions.\nSo what this shows is that the economic concept of screening brings to the identity-driven rational choice model the idea of free spaces, well established within the sociological literature. To go back to the beginning of this essay, the existence of such spaces is something that the network models, with their focus on costs of communication, don\u0026rsquo;t seem well equipped to describe. So now we have a single theory that covers both uprisings and pre-revolutionary dissent, instead of two (one micro, one macro). We can now see that the \u0026ldquo;free spaces\u0026rdquo; of online dissent are similar to, and exist for the same reasons as, other free spaces that have existed in the past. Even in Egypt, the role of the Ultras football fans can fit within this model, the football stadium terraces providing a \u0026ldquo;tolerated\u0026rdquo; institution within which dissent could be expressed. The model also argues that the key facet of online spaces is not their technological nature, but the fact that they were adopted by, and associated with, the broadly anti-establishment demographic of urban youth. Navigating the discussion spaces of the online world is easy if you have friends who are taking part: not so easy if you are a government official trying to pose as a disenfranchised youth. The technology of social media is epiphenomenal. In broad strokes, this is an argument I made some time ago here: it\u0026rsquo;s only taken two years for me to work it out properly.\nInstitutions and Challenges\nThe final case to look at is when a social movement challenges a weak government. The goal is to put the government in a \u0026ldquo;dictator\u0026rsquo;s dilemma\u0026rdquo;. The idea that clamping down on dissent has the possibility of drawing attention to it, and perhaps fanning the flames, is an old one. Here is a recent statement:\n[S]ometimes repression inspires more mobilization; and sometimes it effectively quashes movements or pushes them underground. Sometimes repressive forces are successful in characterizing protesters as legitimate targets of repression, and other times they deligitimize the State and increase the legitimacy of the social movements. – Cristina Flesher Fominaya and Lesley Wood Or, going back a little further:\nCensorship makes every banned text, bad or good, into an extraordinary text. – Karl Marx The contrasting fortunes of the GDR protests and the Tienanmen Square protests in 1989 are the best known example of this dual possibility.\nWhen they believe the time is right, social movements may actively seek to provoke a crisis (contrary to the \u0026ldquo;safety in numbers\u0026rdquo; cost minimization that the information cascade theorists tend to favour). Famously, here is Gandhi:\nThe function of a civil resistance is to provoke response and we will continue to provoke until they respond or change the law. – M. K. Gandhi We can bring this idea of provocation into a micro model if we bring in a unitary social movement and invoke an interdependency between identity polarization and government coercion. Again, the mathematics is in the paper.\nThe question we ask is \u0026ldquo;if you were an organized opposition, what institution would you target, so that a clampdown would cause polarization?\u0026rdquo; The idea is that clampdown on a mainstream institution would be more likely to polarize society, by disturbing even the government\u0026rsquo;s own supporters, than clamping down on an \u0026ldquo;outsider\u0026rdquo; institution. Again, the opposition has to make a payment to appropriate a mainstream institution, because of membership selectivity. They have to pass with the identity of a status quo supporter. They need to appeal to mainstream sensibilities and to establish legitimacy. Under the right circumstances, an opposition will pay the cost of provocation, because they anticipate that a government response will weaken, not strengthen, the government\u0026rsquo;s level of control. Here is a figure showing a set of institutions that can be used by an opposition to provoke a crisis.\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_507\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;450\u0026rdquo;] Institutions that may provoke a crisis[/caption]\nThe institutions that may provoke a crisis are those within the central closed shape, bounded clockwise by light blue (on top), green, red, and purple. Some of these institutions are \u0026ldquo;tolerated\u0026rdquo; institutions to the left of the x* line, with oppositional identities; for these institutions there is no membership cost to be paid by the opposition. Others are \u0026ldquo;prescribed\u0026rdquo; institutions that have a mainstream identity. The opposition must pay the price of appropriating these institutions: participating in them in such a way as to provoke the government.\nAn example of this behaviour comes again from the GDR uprisings of 1989, as described by Steven Pfaff. The opposition chose the celebrations of the GDR\u0026rsquo;s fortieth anniversary – a mainstream institution – in which to provoke a response. The government did respond, but \u0026ldquo;its brutal attacks on peaceful protesters during the fortieth anniversary … probably activated what might have otherwise remained despairing, but inert, citizens.\u0026rdquo;\nThe opposition made explicit attempts to portray themselves as mainstream Germans, adopting the simple slogan of \u0026ldquo;Wir sind das volk\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;We are the people\u0026rdquo;).\n\"Wir sind das volk\" [was] a thin claim, but an uncomplicated \"us versus them\" message, a claim to political identity that could bridge lines of class, education, neighborhood, and so on. – Steven Pfaff In previous times, other uprisings have explicitly chosen mainstream or sometimes tolerated institutions as a means of provocation. Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s use of the Salt March, the Chinese students\u0026rsquo; use of the death of Hu Yaobang and Tienanmen Square, the Egyptian protesters appropriation of National Police Day and Tahrir Square all follow this pattern.\nThere are claims that digital technologies at times of crisis can act in this manner. Ethan Zuckerman has popularized the idea as a \u0026ldquo;Cute Cat\u0026rdquo; theory: that mainstream institutions provide a venue for dissent that cannot be shut down without polarizing society. The theory here provides at best limited and conditional support for the idea. Digital technologies were not used as a mechanism of provocation, but played a supporting role. The \u0026ldquo;cute cat\u0026rdquo; idea has credence only if the government is not able to silence dissent in a more selective manner than shutting down the entire internet or phone service within the country.\nMy favourite example is the French \u0026ldquo;Banquet Campaign\u0026rdquo; of 1848. Republicans were campaigning for universal male suffrage against an intransigent government that had banned political meetings. Faced with the problem of organizing an opposition in such an environment, they organized banquets. On the 18th of July in Mâcon, Burgundy, five hundred tables were set up for three thousand guests with stands for three thousand more, ostensibly as a celebration of local literary star Alphonse de Lamartine. Lamartine was not just a literary star though, he was also a well-known republican, and the authorities knew that the banquet was a cover for political agitation. But the authorities judged that interfering with the banquets would inflame the situation rather than succeed in suppressing the protest, and so let the banquet proceed. With the success of the Mâcon banquet, the \u0026ldquo;Campagne des banquets\u0026rdquo; was launched, and banquets were held around the country. This is the high wire act that governments and opposition walk at times of crisis – when to push ahead, when to hold back, and what tactics may be effective – and is the kind of dance that social movement studies have helped to elucidate. The campaign continued until February of the next year, when the government decided it had no choice but to escalate. The banquets were outlawed, a hastily organized protest brought people into the streets of Paris on February 22, a confrontation between the Municipal Guard and the marchers spilled over into riots, everything got out of hand, and the King fled Paris. Within a few weeks governments were toppled in Milan, Venice, Naples, Palermo, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Berlin. I like to think that the graph above captures a little of that drama.\nConclusions What I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to do here is follow the Akerlof \u0026amp; Kranton example of taking the rich sociological concepts of identity seriously, and used it to construct a rational choice model of uprisings that complements, rather than competes with, sociological models. I\u0026rsquo;ve added some dynamics to the approach, and brought in a modelling of institutions to build on the notion of collective identity as a motivating force for protest.\nThe results are that the theory recovers the key facet of other rational choice models of uprisings, which is cascades, but with a different interpretation. Here it is \u0026ldquo;identity cascades\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;information cascades\u0026rdquo; that drive the sudden change. Beyond cascades, the theory shows how screening provides a mechanism for the existence of \u0026ldquo;free space\u0026rdquo; institutions in which dissent can be sustained, even in authoritarian regimes. Finally, it shows how an organized opposition may appropriate mainstream institutions with the explicit intent of provoking a crisis, putting the government in a \u0026ldquo;dictator\u0026rsquo;s dilemma\u0026rdquo; in which neither responding nor failing to respond is a good option.\n(Written in Org version 7.9.3f with Emacs version 23)\n","date":1361851124,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"3ecfc95e3d83f6a1b406ff1cbae1c9a2","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/503/","publishdate":"2013-02-26T03:58:44Z","relpermalink":"/post/503/","section":"post","summary":"Table of Contents  Introduction\n Facebook as a \u0026ldquo;free space\u0026rdquo;\n Connecting Identity to Rational Choice?\n Identity Cascades\n Free Spaces and Screening\n Institutions and Challenges\n Conclusions\n  Introduction _Finishing up what I said I\u0026rsquo;d finish a couple of months ago, this is a shorter version of a paper on \u0026ldquo;Identity, Institutions, and Uprisings\u0026rdquo; with less mathematics, no references (see the link above) and more opinionating.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tNotes on Identity, Institutions, and Uprisings\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I've moved my site here from whimsley.typepad.com.

But no! It is merely an aide-resolution, to get myself moving forward in 2013.\nBackground New Year. Time to take a realistic look at the state of my writing.\nThe goal of my writing was to have an impact, however small, on issues that matter to me. I had been an activist in a number of political, union, and social justice organizations, and writing seemed to be a way to continue to contribute that fit into a new stage of my life. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to write in my spare time for roughly 15 years now. When I started, my children were entering school; now they are adults.\nThe first half of that 15 years was spent writing and studying/researching No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart. Whimsley started off as an attempt to promote the book, but soon moved into technology \u0026amp; politics, where it has stayed ever since.\nThe total cost of this writing project to me and my family is now well into six figures in foregone income: several years ago I \u0026ldquo;negotiated\u0026rdquo; a four-day working week, largely to pursue this project. On the other hand, it has to coexist with a nearly-full-time job, which means that although much of what I write has a pseudo-academic bent, I doubt that I\u0026rsquo;m in a position to obtain qualifications relevant to what I write about.\nI hesitate to post this, as it\u0026rsquo;s self-involved and not very cheery, but it may provide some useful information for other bloggers.\nAssessment Here are some metrics for the seven years since No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart was published, most of which relate to my blogging:\n Sales of \u0026ldquo;No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart\u0026rdquo;. Around 1,000 2,000. Most in the first year. (Thanks to Brad DeLong and Alex Tabarrok for many of those)\n Blog readership: Sitemeter says about 100 hits a day, and I guess that about half of that is people/bots who don\u0026rsquo;t read. The traffic is about the same as it was in 2008.\n Number of invitations to contribute to other publications: 3. (Thanks to Bronwyn Drainie and Alastair Cheng)\n Number of invitations to contribute to other sites: 3. (Thanks to Henry Farrell)\n Number of invitations to conferences and workshops: 2. (Thanks again, Henry)\n Number of publications to have quoted my work, to my knowledge: 1. (Thanks Evgeny Morozov)\n Awards, prizes, or nominations for same: 0.\n  What can I say? That is not a picture of success, and given the generous support I have received, the responsibility for remaining mistakes clearly lies, as they say, with the author.\nMy major reward from blogging has been to discover a small but select group of very smart people who have continued to read this blog, promote it from time to time, and engage in conversation. Thanks to each of you.\nThe highlight of this year came out of a rant on the \u0026ldquo;Open Data movement\u0026rdquo;, written in a fit of pique one morning and publicised by Evgeny Morozov on Twitter, which led to an opportunity to post at Crooked Timber on the topic. Second was contributing to the Literary Review of Canada again. But let\u0026rsquo;s be honest: writing to have an impact at the age of 53 feels very different from writing at the age of 38, and the numbers make it clear that it\u0026rsquo;s not working. To reinforce that feeling, the traffic for an individual post at the blog depends hugely on whether some of a small number of individuals link to it: I am still dependent, that is to say, on patronage and on chance, and I have not managed to build an audience of my own to sustain significant interest.\nDiagnosis I suspect my own failings are the major cause for this poor performance. I write slowly and infrequently, and usually long pieces. Clearly the style and content of my writing has failed to build a significant audience.\nA second reason is that, naive as this sounds (especially in the light of what I write), I actually thought that writing stuff and putting it on the web would be enough to build a reputation and an audience. Clearly it isn\u0026rsquo;t, and that should not be surprising. I have no credentials behind what I write, I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at self-promotion, my networks related to my writing are minimal, and although some pieces have been provocative I am uncomfortable in the culture of quickfire debate that drives much political writing. None of those things is likely to change.\nIf anything, the effort has emphasized to me the importance of credentials. I know that I use them myself: coming across a new blog or a new book I look for what others have said about the writer. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect others to do anything different when deciding about me.\nPrognosis Uncertain. I suspect that I will continue here for a while yet, but something has to change. Fortunately I will have quite a lot of time in 2013, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad time to try to change something. I am looking at these possibilities.\n See what I can do with this paper to gain credentials. I am circulating it, but see comment on self-promotion above.\n Pull together a book based on what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing here (likely working title \u0026ldquo;Wikibollocks: The Broken Promises of Openness\u0026rdquo;) but I suspect that it would be too dry for a popular book (plus I cannot point to a big reader base when approaching publishers), and that I\u0026rsquo;m undercredentialled to write an academic book. If I were a publisher I would not take me on.\n What\u0026rsquo;s that? Why yes, I am open to offers.\n  So, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to see.\nFavourites On the bright side, here are some pieces I still feel good about (31 of them).

Can your short article in the New York Times, Apps to Regulate Apps, be the product of the same grey matter that produced the excellent \u0026ldquo;Who Controls the Internet?\u0026rdquo; and the admirable \u0026ldquo;The Master Switch\u0026rdquo;? What\u0026rsquo;s going on? I hope it was a momentary lapse and I hope you will change your mind about this sloppy and potentially damaging piece.\nYou were writing, as you know, about AirBnB and Uber: two new \u0026ldquo;peer-to-peer\u0026rdquo; companies building big businesses around apps that let you \u0026ldquo;book a car ride or rent someone\u0026rsquo;s apartment using your smartphone or computer\u0026rdquo;, and apparently breaking a few laws along the way. You write that \u0026ldquo;no one can deny that these apps are responding to real demands and helping cities become easier to live in and visit\u0026rdquo;, and you place them on the side of Progress, and the Future; in contrast, the reactions of cities who have banned these apps \u0026ldquo;recall Ned Ludd\u0026rsquo;s response to the automated loom\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile you do acknowledge that there are complaints about the companies, you decide that \u0026ldquo;many of the complaints are anecdotal\u0026rdquo;. But complaints are always anecdotal unless someone tallies them, and tallying them is, of course, one of the points of regulation: AirBnB and Uber are not tallying them, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. They may even try to sweep them under the rug in case it damages their valuation: exactly the kind of conflict of interest that make regulations necessary in the first place.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s step back a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m no Valley Visionary, so if I were setting up a business based on offering unlicensed hospitality or cab rides, I might ask myself a few questions first. And I may ask myself: why is it that every town and city I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to has licensing requirements for people offering taxi services or overnight accommodations? Is there a global taxi cartel or a multinational bed-and-breakfast conglomerate enforcing its will on municipalities from Aberystwyth to Yellowknife? And if there isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ndash; and of course there isn\u0026rsquo;t, because taxi and B\u0026amp;B operations are usually local and small-scale operations \u0026ndash; I may ask myself: what\u0026rsquo;s behind all these rules?\nAnd if I stopped for more than two minutes before seeking seed funding for my enterprise, I may tell myself about property zoning, about landlord-tenant agreements, about the risks run by customers who step into a taxi or a hotel in a strange city, about liability in the event of accidents, about the importance of equitable access, about complaints investigation, about safety checks, and more. Not, of course, that licensing is unproblematic in all cities – far from it – but these would at least be things I would wonder before proclaiming that those who stand in the way of my right to make a buck are simply Luddites. And if I were to advocate changing zoning regulations in cities throughout the world, and changing taxicab licensing rules too, with all the expense that comes with those changes, I\u0026rsquo;d have put a little thought into it. Especially because, as you say in your final sentence, \u0026ldquo;It is, in short, a time to think carefully\u0026rdquo;. Unfortunately, all the evidence is that AirBnB and Uber have not stopped to think, so the idea that they should set the agenda for civic licensing discussions, placing new stresses on the already-stretched finances of municipalities around the world, despite displaying such solipsistic lack of attention, is presumptuous at least and offensive at worst.\nUnfortunately your two suggestions – that cities should require the companies to provide applications which could be used by landlords and co-op boards with a check on their tenants\u0026rsquo; use of AirBnB, or that cities could \u0026ldquo;simply\u0026rdquo; require Uber to disclose information about its prices and traffic – do not even scratch the surface of the issues that need to be sorted out before AirBnB or Uber can be taken seriously as forward-thinking, sustainable partners in civic development. And I hope that, if you reflect, you\u0026rsquo;ll agree that the new peer-to-peer companies are a blight on the landscape of egalitarian thinking. Yes, according to CNN, CEO Brian Chesky \u0026ldquo;thinks of Airbnb as more than a company – to him it is a movement. His site invites users to return to a time when hitchhiking wasn\u0026rsquo;t dangerous – when it was just fine to share anything with strangers because no one was all that strange.\u0026rdquo; But Brian Chesky has not tried to start a movement, he\u0026rsquo;s started a company: and he hasn\u0026rsquo;t actually done anything much to make hitchhiking less dangerous. He wants his customers to think of it as a movement while he owns the business. While they invoke the communitarian traditions of the informal economy, these new peer-to-peer companies are more likely to erode that economy than enhance it.\nWe all know the informal economy. I used to hitchhike to university, my neighbours have yard sales, friends help each other move house. None of this activity is regulated because it\u0026rsquo;s at most minimally commercial. But there is a line, of course: if I started having a yard sale every weekend then my neighbours might think I\u0026rsquo;m stretching a point and complain to the by-law people. If I rented my house to strangers week in and week out – for money \u0026ndash; they might ask if I\u0026rsquo;m running a rooming house. And that\u0026rsquo;s assuming that the people renting my house aren\u0026rsquo;t running a brothel. So there is a trade-off here: informal activity for little or no money is OK. Commercial activity plays by different rules; a level of accountability is needed.\nSo now here comes AirBnB (to take one example), who want to keep the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s about the noncommercial and \u0026ldquo;sharing\u0026rdquo; informal economy, and scale it up. They talk about their hosts in a non-commercial sense: earning \u0026ldquo;additional income\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;extra money\u0026rdquo; (link) \u0026ndash; rolling out, I could not help but notice, the very phrases used years ago to justify not giving women\u0026rsquo;s jobs the same protections and benefits as men\u0026rsquo;s jobs. It\u0026rsquo;s not the real economy, it\u0026rsquo;s just a bit of pocket money: we don\u0026rsquo;t need all those expensive rules and regulations. But they want to build a billion dollar business on the back of it. And while eBay famously did this for knick-knacks, the nature of the activities makes the two companies completely different. There are information asymmetries with serious consequences here. The model is that AirBnB take 10% of the booking fees and take 0% of the responsibility for what happens when you book, or hire, a room. Now many exchanges do go well, partly because the early stages of an activity like this do draw from a community of people who are committed to the non-commercial side of the action, but the success attracts others, and for personal safety in such cases (rare incidence but severe consequences) recommender systems are simply not the right tool. It\u0026rsquo;s not like Wikipedia (or eBay or Yelp) because you can\u0026rsquo;t just Undo an apartment-trashing, and the fact that AirBnB had not thought about what happens when an apartment is trashed shows, as Farhad Manjoo writes, that is simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t thinking. It didn\u0026rsquo;t care. And if Brian Chesky really thought about AirBnB as a movement, he\u0026rsquo;d care.\nThe questions are heightened by the contrast between the community-friendly rhetoric of the company and the apparent character of its founders. One has a reported history as a spam-merchant (that and more from Ryan Tate), and the financing has raised ethical questions about the way in which early investors can take large amounts of money out of the business without diluting their control. The long and short of it is that the company runs as a scheme to make large amounts of money for a small number of people by appealing to large numbers of egalitarian-minded young people. Investment (and presumably board-level presence) from Andreessen-Horowitz, Yuri Milner, and now maybe Peter Thiel, all with well-known neo-liberal attitudes, makes this clear.\nYour other company, Uber Taxi, has a similar litany of complaints: taking a 50% cut of tip money (illegal in many places), and more. The \u0026ldquo;surge pricing\u0026rdquo; following Hurricane Sandy is a clear example of the eat-your-cake-and-have-it approach that characterizes these peer-to-peer businesses: the company adopts hard-nosed Economics 101 pricing models (which we can argue about) while employing a rhetoric of community and sharing. You can have at most one or the other, but not both. Unsurprisingly it is run, as Seth Finkelstein pointed out on my previous post, by an admirer of Ayn Rand.\nThe contrast with real efforts to break down barriers to access and to make more accessible, non-commercial travel a reality is dramatic. None of the peer-to-peer companies \u0026ldquo;start from an entrenched social problem and work backwards from there\u0026rdquo; as Catherine Bracy writes. For real inspirarion, look back to efforts like the Ramblers Association\u0026rsquo;s 1932 mass trespass of Kinder Scout, the services provided over the years by the Youth Hostel Association and Hostelling International, all characterized by a broad base, by people who thought about what they were doing, and who had an actual commitment to their goals. And guess what? Remarkably enough, none of these has billionaire venture capitalists - or even the profit motive - behind them.\nSo, Tim. Back to the beginning. The Randian, simplistic free-market thoughtlessness behind the wave of \u0026ldquo;peer-to-peer\u0026rdquo; companies, and especially those who are trying to uproot regulations that protect consumers, is far from the wave of the future: it\u0026rsquo;s hucksterism masquerading as progress, hubris as vision, callous selfishness as community-mindedness, and it\u0026rsquo;s a disaster waiting to happen. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s something you want to associate yourself with.

From here on, the author is \u0026quot;SBJ\u0026quot; and the book is \u0026quot;FP\u0026quot;. Page numbers are in parentheses.   First, and the reason I am writing this: Claiming that the \u0026ldquo;peer progressive worldview\u0026rdquo; stands for decentralization and egalitarianism. It will lead instead to an increasingly polarized world, with centralization of information on an unprecedented scale.\n Starting with a promise that it does not keep. In its opening pages, FP tells the story of air traffic to highlight the unappreciated, steady, incremental progress of living conditions over the course of the 20th century, brought about by a combination of private enterprise and government regulation, rightly highlighting the overlooked role of public sector in improving quality of life. The author criticizes \u0026ldquo;progressives\u0026rdquo; for being too \u0026ldquo;ambivalent about actual progress\u0026rdquo; (xxxiii), yet soon the boot will be on the other foot, and SBJ will cast aside this optimistic tale of progress. The progressives that so dismay him, of whom I am one, turn out to have a more positive attitude to history than the \u0026ldquo;peer progressives\u0026rdquo; that the book celebrates.\n Having a short attention span. Only a few pages further on, the switch takes place, unremarked. SBJ writes of his peer progressives that \u0026ldquo;In an age of great disillusionment with current institutions, here was a group that could inspire us, in part because they had attached themselves to a new kind of institution, more network than hierarchy – more like the Internet itself than the older models of Big Capital or Big Government\u0026rdquo; (xxxvii). The institutions that he was praising just a few short pages ago are now caricatured with Big Capital Letters, labelled as relics of old-style thinking (see also p 51). SBJ now adopts the very disillusionment that so upset him, turns away from incremental progress, and never looks back, taking on the more romantic mantle of the revolutionary. The truth in his introductory pages, that the value of incremental progress will inevitably be overlooked, is ironically confirmed.\n Dismissing the work of aid workers. As if to rub our noses in his rejection of incrementalism, SBJ tells a story about foreign aid workers Jerry and Monique Sternin, and their work in Vietnam. He praises these protagonists because they \u0026ldquo;did not descend on those communities with the usual imperious style of many foreign aid groups\u0026rdquo; (p 21). And in that imperious style, the work of charities around the world is dismissed. There is not a sentence, here or elsewhere, about the dedicated individuals who do not fit his message that everything must be changed. There are no grey areas here, and no need to think twice about this blanket, qualifier-free condemnation. Curmudgeon I may be, unready to adopt the self-proclaimed optimism of the author, but my cynicism seems to me shallow compared to the cavalier attitude of FP. A list of \u0026ldquo;things wrong\u0026rdquo; may seem negative, but it at least reflects an engagement with the subject, a consideration of the author\u0026rsquo;s point of view. \u0026ldquo;Usual imperious style\u0026rdquo; indeed.\n Identifying peer networks inconsistently, wherever it suits him, leading to a morass of confusion. Many structures contain different elements, hierarchical, competitive, and collaborative, and SBJ simply highlights the aspect that fits his message. He likes the Sternins\u0026rsquo; work, so he says they build on the \u0026ldquo;peer networks of rural Vietnam\u0026rdquo;. Peer progressives, the author tells us, \u0026ldquo;genuinely like free markets\u0026rdquo;, except when they yield \u0026ldquo;power concentrated in a handful of economic oligarchs\u0026rdquo; (p 29), but then again when the economic oligarchs live in Silicon Valley, we will see that things are different again.\n Making a brief reference to trading towns of the early Renaissance as \u0026ldquo;adher[ing] to peer-network principles in much of their social organization\u0026rdquo; (p 27) is far from enough to claim that these towns are \u0026ldquo;the birthplace of modern capitalism\u0026rdquo; (28), and to place the whole of modern industry on the network side of the leger. A flimsy statement, unsupported by evidence or argument, and not to be taken seriously.\n And what a misuse of history throughout! The book treats the rich and diverse history of organizational structures as a source of a few nuggets, chosen to illustrate a pre-defined agenda.\n Speaking of which: no bibliography, a mere seven pages of notes, and seven pages of index.\n Only TED, that admirer of bite-size chunks of information, could refer to this short book as a tome. It is slim: 250 pages of generously-sized and widely-spaced text.\n Caricaturing the cultural industry in order to bury it. There are eight pages on the novelty and potential of Kickstarter, the fundraising site for creative activities. The main story is of Jacob Krupnick, a film maker who raised $24,817 on Kickstarter to make a 71-minute dance music video, with almost half of the 600 donations being less than $30. We are told that \u0026ldquo;Historically, Jacob Krupnick would have been forced to choose among three paths… go mainstream, find a wealthy benefactor, or turn his creative vision into a part-time hobby\u0026rdquo; (35). I have taken to pausing after every bold, broad-brush assertion like this to think of a story that would tell the opposite message. In this case I think of Glasgow\u0026rsquo;s Bill Forsyth, who in 1980 raised £2,000 for his first film, \u0026ldquo;That Sinking Feeling\u0026rdquo; by posing as a concerned youth worker. He sent his begging letter to local bookies, brewers, distillers, and others. A local trade union sent £2, both William Hill and Marks \u0026amp; Spencers sent £25, and a biscuit company sent a few pounds too. Forsyth, of course, went on to make Gregory\u0026rsquo;s Girl and Local Hero.\n Ignoring the role of money. When I hear someone tell me that it\u0026rsquo;s not about the money I reach for my wallet. \u0026ldquo;What is ultimately important about Kickstarter is not whether it is a for-profit company or a creature of the gift economy or some interesting hybrid – what is important is the social architecture of the service\u0026rdquo; (47). Kickstarter\u0026rsquo;s requirement of delivering money to its owners and/or shareholders will shape the direction it takes.\n Identifying fundraising over the airwaves (by American National Public Radio for example) as a centralized \u0026ldquo;Legrand Star\u0026rdquo;, while claiming fundraising on Kickstarter is a peer network (39). After all, each project raising funds on Kickstarter is its own \u0026ldquo;Legrand Star\u0026rdquo;. Meanwhile, the centralized 311 system is portrayed as a network. See 4, above.\n Giving the Internet too much credit for the Arab Spring uprisings. \u0026ldquo;To date, the most prominent examples of network architectures influencing real-world change have been the decentralized protest movements that have emerged over the past few years: MoveOn, Arab Spring, the Spanish Revolution, Occupy Wall Street… .\u0026rdquo; (48 – 49)\n \u0026ldquo;Arab Spring\u0026rdquo; is not and never was a movement (48).\n The Spanish Revolution? There wasn\u0026rsquo;t one. (48)\n Claiming that [the] Arab Spring is \u0026ldquo;something of a distraction\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;concrete and practical\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;The grand spectacles of Occupy or Arab Spring have turned out to be something of a distraction, averting our eyes from the more concrete and practical successes of peer networks.\u0026rdquo; (49)\n \u0026ldquo;But every material advance in human history – from the Great Wall to the Hoover Dam to the polio vaccine to the iPad – was ultimately the by-product of information transfer and decision making. This is how progress happens: some problem or unmet need is identified, imaginative new solutions are proposed, and eventually society decides to implement one (or more) of those solutions.\u0026rdquo; Here is the play without Hamlet. What dark tragedies are glossed over in \u0026ldquo;society decides\u0026rdquo;. This is a bloodless, technocratic view of material progress, reflecting the similarly bloodless path he charts to the future, in which problems are solved, but struggles never fought. (49)\n Believing in a magic bullet. \u0026ldquo;When a need arises in society that goes unmet, our first impulse should be to build a peer network to solve that problem\u0026rdquo;. (50)\n Believing that he is beyond all that old Left/Right stuff. (51)\n Claiming the peer network \u0026ldquo;is not some rarefied theory, dreamed up on a commune somewhere, or in a grad school seminar on radical thought\u0026rdquo; (52). Not only anti-intellectual, he is also dismissive of other alternative cultures.\n Presenting New York\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;311 service\u0026rdquo;, a municipal non-emergency incident-reporting system, as a peer network; it is the centralization of a previously disparate set of services, a Legrand Star of information collection using standard big-enterprise Customer-Relationship Management software from Oracle (55 – 58).\n Spending several pages telling us how the 311 phone service for problem reporting allowed the government of New York to track the periodic maple syrup smell to a flavour compound manufacturer processing fenugreek seeds. What is the point? The identification of one smell is so non-earth-shattering as to be sleep-inducing.\n How many times will we be told about the revolutionary potential of reporting the location of potholes using a smartphone app? (57) Has there ever been any evidence that pothole-location-ignorance is a problem to be solved, never mind the limiting factor on local government\u0026rsquo;s ability to keep our streets in good condition? If so, why have none of these accounts produced it?\n Being blind to the privacy concerns of New York Taxi drivers. He speaks of installing \u0026ldquo;GPS devices that communicate vast amounts of information back to the Taxi and Limousine Commission\u0026rdquo; in taxis (65) as if it puts the taxi drivers as peers in a peer network. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s a centralizing, hierarchical, overseeing move. The fact that SBJ does not see this is an indication of his willingness to see what he wants to see. This is the \u0026ldquo;peer progressive\u0026rdquo; world? (63) Count me out.\n Underestimating the role of actual peer networks. When friends of the authors wanted to renovate their basement, they found out about major roadworks in the area just in time, from neighbours (67). \u0026ldquo;Yet despite its urgency, the news had arrived on their doorstep via the word-of-mouth network of two neighbours gossiping together\u0026rdquo;. (68) SBJ sees this as a failing of traditional news distribution, calling for a new peer-network structure, but he should see as evidence of the strength of existing networks.\n Not trusting undesigned systems. Neighbourhood networks do not have a purpose, while the \u0026ldquo;peer networks\u0026rdquo; that SBJ promotes are single-purpose problem-solving initiatives (see 16, above). Power in designed networks resides with the network owner; power in informal networks is dispersed. By neglecting neighbourhoods (despite his claim to be writing in the spirit of Jane Jacobs) he is missing the complexity and richness of real-world networks.\n Misunderstanding the role of news in his \u0026ldquo;pothole paradox\u0026rdquo;. What he sees as neighbourhood news (76 – 77) does not need a purpose-built institution to deliver it, it needs strong communities. Blaming \u0026ldquo;traditional journalistic institutions\u0026rdquo; for having a poor track record of meeting this need is like blaming restaurants for not meeting the need for family breakfasts, mistaking a commercial need for a community need.\n Focusing on the supply side, ignoring the demand side. Surveying the shape of the media, FP gives a familiar description of the variety and proliferation of online content. \u0026ldquo;There is going to be more content, not less; more information, more analysis, more precision, a wider range of niches covered.\u0026rdquo; (90) But what voices will be heard, and what opinions amplified? Here, he is silent. He claims that the news system is transitioning \u0026ldquo;from a small set of hierarchical organizations to a distributed network of smaller and more diverse entities\u0026rdquo; (79): I hoped to see him take on some of the serious critiques of this claim, notably Matthew Hindman\u0026rsquo;s extensively researched \u0026ldquo;Myth of Digital Democracy\u0026rdquo;, but there is no mention: all we get are stories of Macworld and online technology blogging.\n So many stories. Stories should be supplements to argument, not the substance of it.\n Quoting \u0026ldquo;The future is here, it\u0026rsquo;s just not evenly distributed yet.\u0026rdquo; It was a clever phrase when William Gibson coined it, but now it is well past its expiry date: it has become a lazy way to brush aside questioning voices. (85)\n Ignoring inconvenient exceptions in the history of the media. Every weekday throughout my childhood, my parents had The Guardian delivered to the door. Owned and run for many years by a non-profit organization (The Scott Trust), it was set up in 1821 by a group of non-conformist Mancunians. For many years after moving to Canada I got the country\u0026rsquo;s largest circulation daily, The Toronto Star, owned by a charitable organization (the Atkinson Foundation). And these are only two I know of - I am far from a media expert. But in FP we read that \u0026ldquo;For more than a century, serious journalism has been financially supported by the massive profits newspapers accumulated, thanks in large part to the near monopoly they had on local advertising.\u0026rdquo; (91) [Most major newspapers, my understanding is, have always run at a bit of a loss, this being the price that their owners pay to have their say in national debates. But I may be wrong.]\n Treating intrusive, data-mined advertising as a positive, productive system, while foreign aid is a problem to be fixed (see 3, above), and education is too (see below). Now, a checkin at a lecture on Foursquare goes out to friends, \u0026ldquo;alerts local businesses who can offer your promotions through Foursquare; the link to the talk helps Google build its index of the Web, which then attracts advertisers interested in your location or the topic of journalism itself…. you are helping your friends figure out what to do tonight, you\u0026rsquo;re helping [the host] promote its event; you\u0026rsquo;re helping a nearby bar attract more customers; you\u0026rsquo;re helping Google organize the web… new forms of value are created, and the overall productivity of the system increases.\u0026rdquo; (94) The assumption of a confluence of interests among advertisers and individuals; the idea that we need to increase the \u0026ldquo;productivity of the system\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means in this context: these are dystopian visions.\n Claiming that ProPublica licenses its content \u0026ldquo;so that whoever wants to publish its articles may do so\u0026rdquo; (94) does not fit with ProPublica\u0026rsquo;s own statement that \u0026ldquo;Many of our \u0026lsquo;deep dive\u0026rsquo; stories are offered exclusively to a traditional news organization, free of charge, for publication or broadcast. We published more than 110 such stories in 2011 with more than 25 different partners.\u0026rdquo;\n Having ignored the history of non-profit news publishing (see above, and BBC anyone?) SBJ emphasizes the non-profit nature of ProPublica, drawing attention to the novelty of the model (95). But FP fails to tell us how ProPublica works. [It is funded by the Sandler Foundation, and it is chaired by Herbert Sandler, a savings and loan CEO who sold his bank to Wachovia Bank for $24 billion in 2004. The Sandlers got $2.4 billion and put $1.3 billion into the Sandler Foundation. Not so different from the Atkinson Foundation and the Scott Trust.]\n Confusing the ability to put a page on the web with reaching a mass market. \u0026ldquo;Every niche perspective – from the extremes of neo-Nazi hate groups to their polar opposites on the far Left – now has a publishing platform, and a global audience, that far exceeds anything they could have achieved in the age of mass media.\u0026rdquo; (99 – 100). I can think of one or two unsavoury groups in 1930s Europe who seemed to reach a fairly big – one might even say global – audience.\n In fact, throughout the whole book there is a silly and distorted comparison of \u0026ldquo;the Internet\u0026rdquo; (now) with \u0026ldquo;mass culture\u0026rdquo; (past), sweeping to one side all the alternative culture that has somehow persisted over the years. It\u0026rsquo;s a stacked deck.\n Treating academia as it treates history, as a source for cherry-picking stories that support an existing viewpoint. In this case, the work of two academics who questioned the \u0026ldquo;filter bubble\u0026rdquo; effect (102). It\u0026rsquo;s the only academic study quoted in the book, so far as I can remember.\n Quoting David Brooks on anything. (103)\n Ignoring the history of \u0026ldquo;leaderless\u0026rdquo; protest. SBJ writes of the Seattle protests of 1999 that \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to think of another political movement that generated as much public attention without producing a genuine leader\u0026rdquo; (106), and I think back to my own political coming-of-age: who were the leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, of Rock Against Racism, of the campaign for abortion rights? Who led the North American resistance to the US wars in Central America, or the poll tax protests in the UK? I see no evidence that the protest movements of today are more leaderless than those of 30 years ago. And I am confident that it\u0026rsquo;s only my ignorance which precludes me from giving earlier examples.\n In 2001, the American state had not \u0026ldquo;optimized its military to do battle with other states\u0026rdquo; (110). As early as the 1980s, the focus on \u0026ldquo;Low Intensity Warfare\u0026rdquo; was well documented, in support of military adventures in Central America, and counterinsurgency in the Pacific. [Also, of course, to fund the \u0026ldquo;Afghan resistance\u0026rdquo; to the Russians. That turned out well.]\n Twitter was not responsible for \u0026ldquo;spawning pro-democratic flashmobs in the streets of Cairo\u0026rdquo;. (111)\n It is true that the whole section on the Internet\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;capacity for shape-shifting\u0026rdquo; (118) and its affordances, or lack of them, is inoffensive. But it has no strong message either.\n The Internet makes communication cheaper, but it wrong to say it \u0026ldquo;democratizes the control of information\u0026rdquo;. (121)\n \u0026ldquo;There is no contesting the tremendous, orders-of-magnitude increase in the numbers of people creating and sharing, thanks to the mass adoption of the Internet\u0026rdquo;. (121) There is some contesting it. The verbs \u0026ldquo;creating and sharing\u0026rdquo; cover many counting oddities: tweeting during a TV show counts, but talking to your family during a TV show does not count. There is and has always been a wealth of \u0026ldquo;creating and sharing\u0026rdquo; to which books such as FP are completely blind.\n Prizes and tournaments are generally not peer networks. Prizes are a useful mechanism to tackle some problems, but again he ropes them into his peer network picture by seeing networks where he wants to see them.\n Caricaturing \u0026ldquo;old-style\u0026rdquo; leftists. The political right and left are characterized as \u0026ldquo;the mirrored alternatives of Big Capitalism and Big Government\u0026rdquo; (139): so much for the co-operative movement and many other autonomous movements on the political left.\n When John Harrison won the longitude prize he was not \u0026ldquo;at the edge of the network\u0026rdquo;. (142) The participants in a prize competition are not a \u0026ldquo;peer network\u0026rdquo;. Uless by \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo; you mean \u0026ldquo;a lot of people\u0026rdquo;.\n The sponsors of prizes have sometimes been networks, as in his tale of the Royal Society for the Arts, but often are not.\n The X Prize Foundation (147) is indeed a peer network. Of billionaires. The resurgence of prizes is not a mark of a new egalitarianism, it is the mark of a new patronage culture born of huge inequality.\n Being unwilling to reach out beyond his immediate circle of comfortable thinkers creates a filter bubble of his own. For example, on the topic of government corruption, his sole source is Lawrence Lessig (157).\n Offering fixes to the problems of democracy through vote delegation (proxy votes), but completely missing the fundamental role of the secret ballot. \u0026ldquo;proxy votes could be bought, of course. A phony public school expert could walk through a neighbourhood handing out twenty-dollar bills to anyone willing to pledge his school superintendent vote to her. But this is true of any democracy.\u0026rdquo; (171) It is simply not true in a democracy with a secret ballot, because no one can verify how an individual\u0026rsquo;s vote was cast, but proxy votes involve an actual visible and trackable transfer of a vote (vote selling), which is completely different. The problem of vote selling, so far as I can tell, is a fatal one for the technocratic schemes in this chapter.\n Presenting Whole Foods Markets as a model of the new decentralized, flattened organization, while ignoring its anti-union, libertarian roots. Autonomy is OK, just so long as it is our autonomy.\n Flattened hierarchies (179) do not necessarily translate into more empowered employees or decentralized organizations. Instead, they can do the opposite, and \u0026ldquo;broaden the span of control for the CEO\u0026rdquo;.\n Taking pains to distinguish \u0026ldquo;peer progressives\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;libertarians\u0026rdquo; on the economic right, but not mentioning that the chapter on \u0026ldquo;Conscious Capitalism\u0026rdquo; takes its name from an organization co-founded by John Mackey, CEO of Whole Food Markets and a committed Randian libertarian.\n Attributing the success of Silicon Valley to \u0026ldquo;the unique social chemistry of the Bay Area, with its strange cocktail of engineering geeks, world-class universities, and countercultural experimentation. But the organizational structure of most Silicon Valley firms also deserves a great deal of credit\u0026rdquo; (185). The idea that Silicon Valley firms are more \u0026ldquo;egalitarian operations\u0026rdquo; (185) than others is daydreaming.\n A fundamental rule of any serious thinking is not to take people at their own valuation, but SBJ breaks this rule repeatedly. He takes his description of the culture and goals of Whole Foods, Intel, and Facebook straight from the leaders of the companies.\n Intel founder Noyce says he \u0026ldquo;rejected the idea of a social hierarchy\u0026rdquo; (186), and there may be some truth to that, but to take seriously the idea that other Silicon Valley CEOs have adopted a peer network approach one would have to avoid looking at any list of the world\u0026rsquo;s wealthiest people.\n Disparaging the education system. My parents were both teachers, and my father did teacher training for many years, so I have absorbed some feeling for the difficulties of making schools effective. But never fear, the peer progressives are here. After a whole page of thinking about the problems of schools SBJ concludes that they would be better if they were run like Whole Foods Markets, because \u0026ldquo;peer progressives want do do away with the bureaucracies as well as the union mentality. They want schools to be run like EOBs (employee-owned businesses), where teachers are shareholders in an enterprise that grows more valiable as it reaches its goal\u0026rdquo; (192). And that\u0026rsquo;s it. No notes, no references to other thinkers. It becomes clear what it means to be an optimist, to be a pragmatic peer progressive. Thousands, perhaps millions of people have thought long and hard about education systems and their problems, but it is fine to ignore them all and still be an optimist. Instead, one can wave a few sentences of lazy thought in their direction, confidently asserting that this is the way forward: yet to question this is presumably to be cynical and negative. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but this is not optimism, and it is not pragmatism, it is the juvenile hubris of the know-it-all.\n Facebook does not \u0026ldquo;want to strengthen the social ties that allow humans round the planet to connect, organize, converse, and share\u0026rdquo; (193). It does not \u0026ldquo;consider the cultivation and proliferation of Baran Webs to be its defining mission\u0026rdquo;. It just says it does. The onus is on the author to show the truth of the statement, and he does not.\n \u0026ldquo;The Facebook platform\u0026rdquo; is not \u0026ldquo;a continuation of the Web and Internet platforms that lie beneath it\u0026rdquo; (193). Facebook is the biggest centralized system ever built: a billion people connected to a single of servers, mediated by a single set of policies, making money for a single set of shareholders. One Server Farm to Rule Them All.\n Faced with the immense wealth of the early Facebook investors, and the personal control that Mark Zuckerberg has, SBJ admits that there is massive cognitive dissonance in the \u0026ldquo;peer network\u0026rdquo; idea. But his solution is simply to hope: \u0026ldquo;top-down control is a habit that will be hard to shake… But the empirical track record of conscious capitalists and employee-owned businesses suggests that we might have been focusing on the wrong elements all along.\u0026rdquo; (195)\n Believing that struggle is unnecessary.

Part of a series about identity, institutions, and uprisings.\nIn the torrent of debate over the causes and dynamics of the \u0026ldquo;Arab Spring\u0026rdquo; uprisings, one of the strongest currents has its source in cascade models of uprisings. The starting points for these models are Mark Granovetter\u0026rsquo;s simple and abstract Threshold Models of Collective Behaviour and Thomas Schelling\u0026rsquo;s similar ideas in \u0026ldquo;Macromotives and Microbehaviour\u0026rdquo;. If a population of individuals is presented with a choice between A and B, and if each will choose A only if some number of other people (their \u0026ldquo;threshold\u0026rdquo;) also choose A, then very small differences in the distribution of thresholds can lead to very different results. In some cases, everyone chooses A, in others everyone chooses B, in others, the population is split. One spark sputters; an identical spark starts a prairie fire.\nTimur Kuran and Susanne Lohmann used these ideas to explain the sudden and surprising uprisings of 1989 in Eastern Europe. Both drew attention to the paucity of information in an authoritarian state, about what others believe and about the nature of the state itself. Highly motivated protesters with a low threshold engage in dissent or protest and thereby reveal information to other disgruntled people about the breadth of disenchantment, or about the nature of the state, or about the experience of other individuals in relation to the state. Others join in and by doing so reveal more. And so it goes. With the right distribution of thresholds, a single person\u0026rsquo;s action can light a fire that sweeps across a continent. Sudden, dramatic uprisings in authoritarian states are a switch from one equilibrium to another as dissent draws back the veil of silence and people see each other, see the nature of the regime under which they live, and realize that everyone else sees it too.\nDigital cascades A new twist has been added to the cascade mix by the 2009 revolt in Iran and the \u0026ldquo;Arab Spring\u0026rdquo; uprisings that erupted in Tunisia two years ago. The highly-publicised role of social media posed new challenges for theories of contentious politics, and three related facets of the events of Spring 2011 made cascade theories appealing:\n The sudden, unexpected nature of the uprisings and their swift spread from country to country bring to mind the Eastern European regimes in 1989-1990.\n The lack of a strong, organized opposition during the early stages of the uprisings is a challenge for theories of social movements, and plays to the strengths of cascade models.\n The prominent role of digital technology, and particularly social media, lends itself to network-based models of society.\n  Cascade models suggest that contentious politics is an assurance game that can be solved so long as the transaction costs associated with information exchange are low enough. According to a popular narrative, social media networks lower those costs, rendering newly vulnerable those states that rely for their stability on information scarcity and on preference falsification. In an information-rich world, the low-information equilibrium is no longer tenable.\nCascade models have, well, cascaded out from academia and into the mainstream world as the primary way to understand the Arab Spring uprisings. For one influential statement, see Clay Shirky in Foreign Affairs, but a quick look through a bibliography of Arab Spring literature (here, here) will reveal many more.\nAs the current gained strength, it absorbed a number of tributaries. One was the Habermasian idea that a rich public sphere or a strong civil society is the fertile ground in which discontent can take root. Another stream focuses on the role of information and the media, bringing communication studies and media studies scholars into the cascade current. The end result is a current that has brought to the fore the role of social media in the Arab Spring, flowing into the sea of mainstream opinion. If you follow the River Nile of commentary about \u0026ldquo;Twitter Revolution\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Facebook Revolution\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Revolution 2.0\u0026rdquo; upstream far enough you reaach the theoretical source: Granovetter and Schelling, Kuran and Lohmann.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s a long way from Granovetter to the Arab Spring, and along the way important things have been lost, and Mistakes Have Been Made.\nCaught in the Net One of the lovely things about cascade theories is that they lend themselves to simulations. Take that idea of a threshold, for example. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it make sense that your threshold for action depends more on the actions of people in your social networks than people in some distant city that you\u0026rsquo;ve never met? So you can start doing computer simulations of cascades, and how they depend on network structure, and how they depend on the density of connections, and… well, the possibilities are almost endless. So network models have become a common way to extend the original simple ideas in more sophisticated ways. New hypotheses get expressed as network models, and the conclusions feed back into the theory.\nBut all the simulations in the world don\u0026rsquo;t change the fact that adopting a network model is an input to the theory, not an output, and that the network society perspective brings with it a whole set of assumptions and priorities that need examination. For example, adopting a network model means relegating organizations and institutions to the periphery, and moving ideas of \u0026ldquo;self-organization\u0026rdquo;, connectivity, and peer-to-peer communication to the centre \u0026ndash; not because of any factual conclusion but because some concepts can be expressed naturally within a network model and others can\u0026rsquo;t. Concepts of symbolism, identity, institutions, and the difficulty of establishing trust are hard to express and so get pushed aside or ignored completely. The popularity of agent-based models doesn\u0026rsquo;t disprove the importance of such concepts, it just makes us blind to them.\nInformation and symbolism Just as the cascade point of view has taken on the \u0026ldquo;network society\u0026rdquo;, so it has highlighted the role of information in authoritarian states, and hence the role of media and technology in fostering change. It\u0026rsquo;s true that information in authoritarian states is limited, almost by definition, but it\u0026rsquo;s a long way from that to the idea that the paucity of common knowledge is what is holding back uprisings. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to express ideas of information flow across networks within agent-based models, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually tell us that information flow in authoritarian societies is the barrier to social change. Yes, there is something of interest in the lens that information provides, but treating it as the only lens of interest is too narrow.\nOnce you start swimming in the cascade current, you find yourself surrounded by like-minded individuals. It\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that agent-based theories have found fertile ground among those interested in technology. After all, technophiles are typically happy with a focus on the role of information, tend to have a mathematical cast of mind, but are less happy with sociological concepts or social-historical investigations of social movements. Economic concepts and techniques find a welcome home (transaction costs and utility functions) while talk of collective identity is more difficult to translate into agent models. To be blunt, adopting the agent-based outlook saves you a lot of work, because you don\u0026rsquo;t have to read all those historical studies of movements and organizations and make up your mind about the issues they raise.\nThat there is something of a cultural divide between the agent-based modelers and other currents of the debate, such as those who study social movements, is not new to me of course: here is Andrew Walder:\n   The field of social movements and contentious politics has been a prolonged effort to establish a sociological alternative to the more parsimonious theories of economics. The increasing insistence on the subjective dimensions of mobilization—collective action frames, the formation of collective identities, the role of emotions—is essentially motivated by a feeling that the initial emphasis on organizations, networks, and political opportunity structures were not sufficiently different from rational social choice models to offer a fully sociological alternative.    Protests and other acts of dissent share many common features. For one, they are often deeply symbolic acts. Protesters choose symbolic days on which to make their point (the 40th anniversary of the GDR), they focus their actions on national symbols (the storming of the National Palace by the Sandinistas). Presenting protest as information-revelation ignores the symbolic nature of protests, the importance of demonstrating \u0026ldquo;worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment\u0026rdquo;, the practice of drawing from a shared repertoire of actions, which other currents of thought have shown to be important. At least, my reading of the literature suggests that there is a lot of verbiage around the basic theory, and sometimes in this verbiage there is reference to the symbolic nature of the protests, but there\u0026rsquo;s little to actually tie the words to the theory.\nIf scholars of social movements have demonstrated that identity and its formation are important motivators for political action, and if these factors appear nowhere in the cascade models that seek to explain sudden political change, then there\u0026rsquo;s a gap in the theory.\nPreference falsification, or obedience? In Timur Kuran\u0026rsquo;s work, the central concept of \u0026ldquo;preference falsification\u0026rdquo; is grounded in the distinction between an internal, private viewpoint and an externally expressed opinion. There is, however, a difficulty with ascribing political function to an internal, psychological state of mind. A diagnosis of \u0026ldquo;preference falsification\u0026rdquo; is only possible after the fact of an uprising. Before the fact, from a political point of view there is no observable difference between a nation of preference falsifiers and a nation of contented citizens, and to the extent that there is any observable difference between the two, preference falsification loses its explanatory power. Similarly, what is the observable difference before the uprising between Lohmann\u0026rsquo;s East German citizens, who each have bad experiences with their government but are unaware of its overall bad performance, and an East Germany of citizens who have had good experiences with their government?\nThe concept of preference falsification makes it dangerously easy to read one\u0026rsquo;s own assumptions and views into the lives of others. The danger becomes apparent in Kuran\u0026rsquo;s book-length exploration of preference falsification. He treats affirmative action in American society as a case of preference falsification, in which the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; feelings of the silent majority were (are?) opposed to affirmative action, but were not voiced because \u0026ldquo;to voice misgivings is to invite censure. Conscious of the risks, Americans have tended to hide their reservations behind a veneer of public consent\u0026rdquo; (p 222), a claim that many would consider exaggerated, at least. He is quick to interpret an incorrect poll on the eve of Nicaragua\u0026rsquo;s 1990 election as evidence of oppression by the Sandinistas over the previous decade. And while Kuran spends much time on preference falsification under Soviet Bloc communism, he has nothing to say about 1930s Fascist Europe. What does the concept of preference falsification have to say about lack of successful internal uprisings against the governments of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy? Were these cases of falsified preferences that did not have a chance to be unfalsified, or did the populace \u0026ldquo;really believe\u0026rdquo; in the official ideology? And is the distinction between the two politically meaningful or did Hanna Arendt have it right when she wrote that \u0026ldquo;politics is not like the nursery; in politics obedience and support are the same\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Arendt quotation comes from a persuasive essay by Xavier Marquez, \u0026ldquo;On the Meaning of Political Support\u0026rdquo;. Marquez goes on to quote Robert F. Worth of the New York Times writing about the fall of Gaddafi: \u0026ldquo;Everyone in Tripoli, it seemed, had been with Qaddafi, at least for show; and now everyone was against him.\u0026rdquo; Here is Marquez at length:\n   Were these people deceiving themselves or others? Did the soldiers really support Gaddafi in the past but now do not? Do some of these people support Gaddafi still? The question makes less sense to me than it once did. It is clear that they once obeyed Gaddafi and now do not… but to attempt to determine if, in their heart of hearts, these people supported Gaddafi then (net of all of these forces) and now do not seems slightly absurd. Their obedience and disobedience, support and lack of support are nothing but the vector product of all the forces (threats of coercion, positive incentives, beliefs about Gaddafi, idiosyncratic likes and dislikes, moral convictions, obscure and half-formed ideas about the future, etc.) operating through them. It may make sense to attempt to disentangle these forces if we are interested in legal or moral responsibility, or in the private tragedies of everyday life in Libya, but it does not make sense to me to attempt to figure out if Gaddafi enjoyed some \"genuine\" level of support (independent of coercion, money, etc.) as a separate explanatory factor.    It\u0026rsquo;s not that there is nothing to preference falsification, but it has come to occupy a status of orthodoxy, and it has pushed other mechanisms into undeserved obscurity. In Steven Pfaff\u0026rsquo;s excellent \u0026ldquo;Exit-Voice Dynamics and the Collapse of East Germany\u0026rdquo;, which presents a rich and multifaceted account of the events of 1989, I could not help but see a tension: it seemed to me that he falls back on preference falsification as explanation more often than he would like to (although he does point to other mechanisms) because of the absence of alternative frameworks in which to think.\nSafety in numbers? Finally, somewhere in the middle of most cascade models there is a \u0026ldquo;safety in numbers\u0026rdquo; assumption. Lohmann (on p92 of her major article) writes that the cost of protest \u0026ldquo;is assumed to be decreasing in the turnout… This assumption can be motivated with the \u0026lsquo;safety in numbers\u0026rsquo; characteristic of the technology of suppression: given the amout of resources a regime devotes to suppressing mass protest, it is plausible that a higher number of activists is associated with a lower likelihood that any one activist will experience injury, death, or imprisonment.\u0026rdquo; Kuran writes \u0026ldquo;The external payoff to siding with the opposition… is apt to become increasingly favorable… with S (the size of public opposition). The larger S, the smaller the individual dissenter\u0026rsquo;s chances of being persecuted for his identification with the opposition.\u0026rdquo;\nThis assumption is weak. An action that the government could afford to ignore during a period of political calm cannot be ignored if it gets big enough. Tienanmen Square did not become a safer place the more people gathered, and neither does Tahrir Square: perhaps quite the opposite. Many protests are deliberately risk-seeking, actively looking to provoke a response from the government. As Gandhi said, \u0026ldquo;The function of a civil resistance is to provoke response and we will continue to provoke until they respond or change the law.\u0026rdquo;\nDo people join large protests because it is safer than joining small protests? Or do they join them because, for example, large protests simply matter more? When a country polarizes, the central issues become deeper dividing lines between supporters of the status quo and those in opposition. The question \u0026ldquo;which side are you on?\u0026rdquo; becomes one that has to be answered.\nWrapping Up What I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to say is that there are underexplored weaknesses in the cascade theory description of uprisings which have continuing impacts on current debates, not only in the academic world, but in the wider world - even including the decisions and actions of dissidents in perilous circumstances. The weaknesses lie in the notions of preference falsification, in assumptions about safety in numbers, in assumptions built into the network models constructed on top of cascade models, and in blind spots regarding the forms of political action, the importance of symbols, the roles of institutions, the formation of identity, and other factors that shape the events around sudden uprisings. The effects of these weaknesses are amplified by the enthusiastic adoption of cascade models, supplemented by loose analogies and anecdotes as if they form part of the theory itself, and have a distorting effect on our understanding of these events, making it easy to see some patterns and difficult to see others. Of course, it would be easier to counter the influence of information-driven cascade theories if there were alternative approaches that also reproduced the dramatic \u0026ldquo;cascade\u0026rdquo; results.

The public profile of these debates about how digital technologies intertwine with dissent in authoritarian states, sprawling from the pages of the New Yorker to Foreign Policy, from specialized academic journals to urgent pamphlets, means that the arguments may influence the choices of dissidents operating in perilous environments; may sway them one way or another as they make life-changing decisions. So the least we can do, even those of us on the fringes of the debates, is to try for the truth.\nParticularly strange, perhaps, is that these disputes are unavoidably theoretical. Of course, it matters greatly to tell a coherent and accurate story of how events played out in each particular case, but the implications of the debates are most urgent for uprisings that have not yet happened and for protests that have not yet been organized. No matter how exhaustively one recounts the unfolding of events in Tunisia in 2011 and 2012, such a telling alone cannot provide guidance to dissidents in Azerbaijan, in Russia, or in Canada for that matter. We cannot avoid theory: we point to a set of mechanisms and say \u0026ldquo;this happened here because of these conditions and for these reasons. In other conditions in different places, here are the possible outcomes\u0026rdquo;. Talk turns inevitably to what is primary and what is mere epiphenomenon. We tell stories that highlight what seems essential and draw attention away from the factors that we deem unimportant. We theorize, and we tell stories based on those theories. We retell anecdotes that encapsulate those theories to prove our points.\nWhen it comes to questions of digital technologies and their roles in political change, and particularly dissent in authoritarian states, there is a whole vocabulary that has come into being that carries along a set of narratives. There are assumptions behind terms such as \u0026ldquo;digital activist\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;internet freedom\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;network society\u0026rdquo; that carry over into the stories and the habitual grooves of thought that we take with us as we try to understand new developments.\nOne current that has been particularly influential in the debates around the \u0026ldquo;Arab Spring\u0026rdquo; uprisings is based on the idea of informational cascades, and this current provides the theory behind much of the optimistic talk about Facebook revolutions and the potential for digital technologies to undermine authoritarian regimes. It\u0026rsquo;s not the only theory of uprisings, but it is a compelling one. So if you\u0026rsquo;re going to tell a different story about digital technologies, you need a different theory. I went looking for what that theory should be, and didn\u0026rsquo;t find one, so I put one together myself, and that\u0026rsquo;s what these posts are about.\nNext: a look at information cascades and what they leave out.\n","date":1354482756,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"a17575f6469a2d2e860c5edfe4c91b2e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/when-theories-matter-uprisings-in-authoritarian-states/","publishdate":"2012-12-02T21:12:36Z","relpermalink":"/post/when-theories-matter-uprisings-in-authoritarian-states/","section":"post","summary":"(Second in a series of hopefully accessible posts about this hard-to-read paper).\nFrom time to time, sitting in a comfortable chair with a cup of coffee reading disputes about Twitter Revolts and Facebook Revolutions, it is easy to think that The Argument is the Thing.

You gave me (and others, I hope) a lot to think about, and a lot to read over the last several days.\n Unfortunately, you\u0026rsquo;re still wrong.\n  The original post was written in the heat of the moment, so here is a more detailed and considered, and therefore almost certainly less-likely-to-be-read, argument about the contradictions and problems of the \u0026ldquo;Open Data Movement\u0026rdquo;.\n2 The Open Government Data Landscape First, here is a map of Open-Government-Dataland (click for a larger popup).\n\nThe longitude, marked across the x axis, indicates the impact of the data itself. The line x=0 is the Yu-Robinson Meridian1 and separates Open-Government-Dataland into an eastern and a western hemisphere, each populated by a spectrum of data. Harlan Yu and David G. Robinson explain the hemispheres this way:\n\"A machine-readable bus schedule aims to promote convenience, commerce and a higher quality of life—it enhances _service delivery_. Disclosures of public contracting opportunities play a dual role, potentially enhancing both economic opportunity and public integrity. And core civic data, such as legislative or campaign finance information, serves a more purely civic role, enhancing _transparency_.\" Tom Lee describes these two hemispheres as \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;open-as-in-data.gov\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;open-as-in-FOIA\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;.\nThe latitude, marked along the y axis, marks the incentive of the data users. Travelling from south to north along a meridian takes us from the purely commercial activities in the south to the purely non-commercial in the relatively poor northern lands. At y=0 we cross the Bates Parallel, named after Jo Bates who has this to say about the conflict between the commercial and non-commercial hemispheres:2\n\"Interviews and observations suggest that some at the periphery of the OGD [Open Government Data] initiative have tended to conceptualise OGD as being about small start-ups, voluntary 'civic hackers', and other micro/small enterprises. This is unsurprising given the heavy weighting towards micro/small businesses in the UK's IT sector and the large number of 'civic hackers' active in the OGD community; however, the potential re-user industry for OGD is broader than this. The PSI [Public Sector Information] re-use industry comprises a range of industries and includes multinational corporations (MNCs) such as Google and LexisNexis, conglomerates such as Daily Mail and General Trust whose DMG information division is the parent company of the UK based Landmark Information Group, as well as an array of SMEs, micro enterprises, independent developers, and voluntary 'civic hackers'.\" While this landscape is rich, the inhabitants of different quadrants of the map can be distinguished easily:\n In the harsh mountains of the North-West3 live the hardy non-commercial \u0026ldquo;civic hackers\u0026rdquo; whose diet consists of transit timetables, weather forecasts, and other pragmatic, useful data obtained, often piece-by-piece, from municipal governments. The culture of the civic hackers displays a combination of civic goals and enjoyment in the intrinsic interest of programming, with a twist of start-up mentality. It is a tribe described vividly by David Eaves4: \u0026ldquo;geek, technically inclined, leaning left, and socially minded. There are many who don\u0026rsquo;t fit that profile, but that is probably the average.\u0026rdquo; This tribe includes organizations such as Code for America (\u0026ldquo;A new kind of public service\u0026rdquo;) as well as small and loosely-coordinated groups of individuals working at a local level and who identify with their role as citizens over their role as consumers.\n The North-Eastern tundra is the home of civil liberties activists, a resourceful tribe bent on promoting government transparency. It is driven by a desire to make information such as lobbying activities, campaign funding, government operations, and legal statutes open and accessible. In the USA you will find organizations such as Sunlight Foundation (\u0026ldquo;Making Government Transparent and Accountable\u0026rdquo;) and Public.Resource.Org (\u0026ldquo;Making Government Information More Accessible\u0026rdquo;) living here. Tom Lee\u0026rsquo;s response5 and Carl Malamud\u0026rsquo;s comments hail from these lands.\n In the warmer lowlands of the South-East, food is a little more plentiful. Here you can find a long-nosed tribe of commercial organizations and individuals who get paid to hold government accountable: the tribe of \u0026ldquo;data-driven journalists\u0026rdquo; which focuses on working with data to carry out its function.\n Finally, by far the most comfortable quadrant in the land is the lush pastures of the South-West, where a tribe of comfortable and well-nourished commercial organizations lives. Some members of this tribe are small and fast moving, but others have grown to giant size and sport odd names such as Google, Microsoft, or ESRI. One member of this tribe, Socrata, wrote another retort to my post of last week.\n  Not everyone lives in a single spot; some organizations are nomadic, wandering from quadrant to quadrant. As just one example, mySociety in the UK has both a commercial and a charitable wing; it runs both transparency-oriented projects such as They Work For You, and service-oriented projects such as Mapumental, which is a commuter-mapping service offered as a commercial product. O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Media lives in the South-West, but Alex Howard (a member of that tribe) spends considerable time in the South East.6\n3 Open Data: Is it a Movement? I hope the geography tour is pretty uncontroversial, and that it helps to orient ourselves with respect to the three claims I made last week about the \u0026ldquo;Open Data Movement\u0026rdquo;:\n It\u0026rsquo;s not a movement in a political or cultural sense of the word.\n It\u0026rsquo;s doing nothing for transparency and accountability in government.\n It\u0026rsquo;s co-opting the language of progressive change in pursuit of a small-government-focused subsidy for industry.\n  Of these three, I stand by about two and a half, although I do agree that the wording is sloppy and could be misleading. In my defense, I wrote quickly, expecting attention from my usual handful of readers (you know who you are; thanks for hanging around.) and not the much bigger audience that the post ended up attracting.7\nIt would take too long to engage in a defence of each of these claims8 so instead I\u0026rsquo;ll set out what I see as the contradictions and confusions that come out of labelling all four tribes that inhabit Open-Government-Dataland as a single movement, and distinguishing them from tribes who do not appear on this map: those share a similar interest (eg, Civil Liberties groups and journalists) but who do not focus on data. I see little coherence in the interests or priorities of the Open-Government-Dataland tribes; in particular the giants of the south-west cast a dark shadow over the other quadrants, and the other tribes may have to drive them out of Open-Government-Dataland or succumb to their hegemony.\n4 Do Civil Liberties and Privatization Belong Together? Encyclopedia Britannica says that a social movement is a \u0026ldquo;loosely organized but sustained campaign in support of a social goal\u0026rdquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s the definition I\u0026rsquo;ll stick with. So what\u0026rsquo;s the social goal of the Open Data Movement? There is a technological goal, spelled out a few years ago by some of its leading lights in terms of the formats, timeliness, completeness and licensing of the data,9 but what is its social goal? Pretty much any description I\u0026rsquo;ve seen gives two separate goals: improved government efficiency and transparency, corresponding to the west and east hemispheres of Open-Government-Dataland.\nBeing in favour of efficiency and transparency is a bit like being in favour of chocolate and cheese: both are good, but it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that they have very much to do with each other. But the problem is deeper than this: Open Data advocates argue not just for efficiency, but for a particular vision of \u0026ldquo;efficiency\u0026rdquo; captured by Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly\u0026rsquo;s phrases \u0026ldquo;Government as a Platform\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gov 2.0\u0026rdquo;.10 This vision places the interests of \u0026ldquo;the public\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the people\u0026rdquo; on the same side as corporations and in conflict with those of the state. The thinking of Open Data advocates is open to the same kind of critique that Jodi Dean makes today about Adbusters\u0026rsquo; Kalle Lasn: that an apparent populist leftism disguises (intentionally or otherwise) an economically neoliberal agenda.\n\"Lasn misrepresents the economic problem of neoliberal capitalism as a division between neoclassical economics and the \"new ecological or bionomic or psychonomic discipline that is bubbling underneath the surface.\" Now maybe I just don't know what he's talking about, but it looks to me like the sort of stuff that is usually wrapped up as complexity theory, with all its talk about emergence and swarms and self-organization and criticality (I talk about this in the first chapter of Blog Theory). It's the same set of ideas part of New Economy thinking, which isn't opposed to neoliberalism at all but was a primary carr[ier] of it, especially insofar as regulation is bad and free flow is good. Thomas Friedman, after all, is like the poster boy of horizontality–The World is Flat\" It does seem to me that the ideologically neoliberal aspects of \u0026ldquo;Gov 2.0\u0026rdquo; have not been absorbed by some of those in the civil liberties tribe. Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly, for example, is both ambitious in his small-government vision (\u0026ldquo;Government 2.0… is government stripped down to its core, rediscovered and reimagined as if for the first time\u0026rdquo;) and explicit in his commitment to market-based delivery of services. He approvingly quotes David G. Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Government Data and the Invisible Hand:11 \u0026ldquo;Private actors, either nonprofit or commercial, are better suited to deliver government information to citizens\u0026rdquo;. When it comes to healthcare he writes \u0026ldquo;[government] should not [take part] by competing with the private sector to deliver health services, but by investing in infrastructure (and \u0026lsquo;rules of the road\u0026rsquo;) that will lead to a more robust private sector ecosystem\u0026rdquo;.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Government as Platform\u0026rdquo; vision is even more market-driven than that of the \u0026ldquo;Cambridge Study\u0026rdquo; reported by Jo Bates (link), and to which Rufus Pollock of the Open Knowledge Foundation contributed. As Bates says, the Cambridge Study argued for \u0026ldquo;unrefined digital data to be available for re-use at marginal cost (general zero for digital resources), whilst the charging regime on refined PSI products should remain intact. These refined products, it is argued, would then be in fair competition with other suppliers, since there would be equal access to unrefined data inputs… In a further paper, Pollock goes on to argue that the optimal charging model would be direct state subsidy or, in some cases, charges to update the database. These economic arguments thus draw on a liberal economic paradigm with strong emphasis on supply-side policies based on removing constraints on commercial production through liberalisation and marketisation, combined with taxpayer subsidisation of infrastructural resources such as data.\u0026rdquo;\nJo Bates\u0026rsquo;s paper This is what modern deregulation looks like (link) explores the contradictions between the efficiency and transparency hemispheres in a thorough and lucid way and really you should just read that if you want a better-informed version of my own views. Here is one of the more abstract and general sections, that sums up her claims:\n\"the current 'transparency agenda' [of the UK government, supported by prominent Open Data advocates] should be recognised as an initiative that also aims to enable the marketisation of public services, and this is something that is not readily apparent to the general observer. Further, whilst democratic ends are claimed in the desire to enable \"the public\" to hold \"the state\" to account via these measures, there is an issue in utilising a dichotomy between the state and a notion of 'the public' which does not differentiate between citizens and commercial interests… The construction… encourages those attracted to civic engagement into an embrace of solidarity with profit seeking interests, distanced from the ever suspect notion of the state.\" The \u0026ldquo;Government as Platform\u0026rdquo; vision widely accepted among Open Data advocates12 thus overlaps significantly with the views of the UK government quoted by Jo Bates, culminating in Francis Maude\u0026rsquo;s statement that Open Government Data is \u0026ldquo;what modern deregulation looks like\u0026rdquo;. Is this neoliberal deregulation a vision that Tom Lee and David Eaves support?\nThe transparency agenda has been used by the PSI Reuse industry and by right-wing governments as a camouflage for other, economically neoliberal goals. Tom Lee describes the Open Data Movement as a \u0026ldquo;self-described nonpartisan activist movement\u0026rdquo; but while I accept his argument that the Civil Liberties tribe, including the Sunlight Foundation, are non-partisan (and, yes, are a movement), I do not think his characterisation can carry over to other tribes. The support, tacit or otherwise, of the Civil Liberties groups for the \u0026ldquo;Government as Platform\u0026rdquo; agenda, means that the Sunlight Foundation is promoting a neoliberal economic position with which its members may not agree.13 I don\u0026rsquo;t dismiss the views of Kevin Merrit, CEO of Socrata, as \u0026ldquo;self-serving and profit-motivated\u0026rdquo; when he argues that the Open Data Movement has promoted transparency, but I do believe there is a conflict of interest (which is a structural fact, not a personal quality) between arguing for an Open Data policy and then making money by providing software to implement that policy. It\u0026rsquo;s a conflict that makes episodes such as New York City\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate release of individual teacher assessments more likely.\n5 Civic and Commercial Interests: Complement or Conflict? Most Open Data advocates don\u0026rsquo;t phrase the issue in terms of private-sector provision of services, but instead phrase it in terms of civic engagement, non-profit groups, and \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo;. Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly often phrases his arguments purely in terms of a civic public (and may see it that way himself), as in \u0026ldquo;This is the right way to frame the question of Government 2.0. How does government become an open platform that allows people inside and outside government to innovate?\u0026rdquo;\nCarl Malamud goes further, arguing that the Open Data Movement is a replacement for a regime in which \u0026ldquo;the commercial sector is raping and pillaging the public treasury, getting exclusive deals on data that not only keeps out other companies, but researchers, public interest groups, and everybody else who make up \u0026lsquo;the public.\u0026rsquo; In many cases, the government data is so tightly behind a cash register that even government workers enforcing the law can\u0026rsquo;t afford to buy copies of the data they produce or the rules they promulgated.\u0026rdquo; Others see no conflict between commerce and civic activity in this area: Tom Lee writes \u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s flatly wrong to consider private actors\u0026rsquo; interest in public data to be uniformly problematic.\u0026rdquo;\nDavid Eaves makes a strong argument for the vitality of the civic hacker tribe, and points out that Open Data has been largely ignored by Canadian corporations (although US companies such as Socrata have gained contracts for providing municipal \u0026ldquo;open data platforms\u0026rdquo;). The Canadian environment may be like that of the UK, where there is a \u0026ldquo;heavy weighting towards micro/small businesses in the … IT sector\u0026rdquo; to quote Jo Bates. Similarly, there are just are not that many Canadian companies deeply involved in government operations or in the use of public data.\n(There have been positive statements from Open Text, and Desire2Learn has sponsored an \u0026ldquo;Edge Challenge\u0026rdquo; that has attracted app developers using open transit data [disclaimer: in my day job I have had some tangential involvement in that competition], but I can see what he means.)\nSo why would I focus on the private-sector, market-based actors of the south west quadrant when the civic hackers are perhaps more prevalent? Because of an argument made a year or two ago by Michael Gurstein, who asks \u0026ldquo;who is in a position to make \u0026lsquo;effective use\u0026rsquo; of this newly available data?\u0026rdquo; and answers himself:\n\"'open data' empowers those with access to the basic infrastructure and the background knowledge and skills to make use of the data for specific ends. Given in fact, that these above mentioned resources are more likely to be found among those who already overall have access to and the resources for making effective use of digitally available information one could suggest that a primary impact of \"open data\" may be to further empower and enrich the already empowered and the well provided for rather than those most in need of the benefits of such new developments.\" Data\u0026rsquo;s value is combinatorial. It is most powerfully used by those who can combine it with other sources of data and who have the scale and resources to use it effectively. I think it\u0026rsquo;s fine that \u0026ldquo;civic hackers\u0026rdquo; are developing transit apps, but in the end that market is likely to be won by a single company under the current licensing and standards approaches.14\nWhile Open Data advocates appear \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; to many new ideas, everything I\u0026rsquo;ve read suggests that they are near-united on the principle of \u0026ldquo;non-discriminatory\u0026rdquo; licensing, meaning making data available to commercial enterprises (of any size) on the same terms as to the Civic Hackers. The economy of data-driven products is similar to the economics of cultural industries: it tends to end in winner-take-all outcomes and favours large-scale enterprises. In cultural markets, this tendency has led many countries to adopt a toolbox of techniques to maintain domestic cultural industries in the face of the scale of the American cultural industry, from quotas to subsidies to non-market providers.15 Such measures have much in their favour, yet the Open Data Movement is apparently united in opposing them.\nEconomically, Silicon Valley is likely to be the major winner in the Open Government Data game. It is difficult to see how to justify a subsidy to Silicon Valley companies as a priority for cash-strapped governments of smaller countries.\nAn example: Jo Bates (again) describes the interest in weather data. \u0026ldquo;In the context of the UK there has been significant lobbying by the financial industry to get better access to UK weather data so that it is able to compete in this [weather risk management] market. Groups such as the Lighthill Risk Network, of which Lloyds of London are a member, have lobbied government for better weather data so that they can develop risk based weather products. Similarly, the insurance industry has requested real time information on the pretext that they might respond more quickly to extreme weather events such as flooding. My own research and the recent announcement suggest that these demands have been met enthusiastically by well placed policy makers in national government who are keen to develop a UK weather derivatives market.\u0026rdquo; Weather risk management might seem like an odd duck, but Bates reports that \u0026ldquo;This weather risk management market far outweighs the USA\u0026rsquo;s commercial weather products market which in 2000 was estimated at approximately $500 million a year\u0026rdquo;, touching over $45 billion in 2005-06.\nThe rhetoric of civic engagement is appealing, but blurring the boundary between small-scale civic \u0026ldquo;hackathons\u0026rdquo; and the major financial institutions is a position that simply ignores major economic and political issues.\nThe benefits of standards-driven formats are, for municipal activities, not obvious unless you want to attract global interest. I continue to believe that licensing and formats are an area where there is still room for innovation, and where a premature focus on standardization may shorten the lifespan of civic-hacker use of municipal data before the big players get to pull it into their own systems. I\u0026rsquo;d argue, as I have before, for some form of charging to be enabled, at least on large-scale commercial use of data. I\u0026rsquo;d also argue that standardization should not be high on the agenda for municipal governments looking to build and collaborate with a local community of hackers.\n6 Summary Let me return to my three claims:\n It\u0026rsquo;s not a movement in a political or cultural sense of the word.\n It\u0026rsquo;s doing nothing for transparency and accountability in government.\n It\u0026rsquo;s co-opting the language of progressive change in pursuit of a small-government-focused subsidy for industry.\n  I\u0026rsquo;d argue that (1) holds: there is simply too much incoherence, too much in the way of conflicting interests and non-overlapping goals, for the \u0026ldquo;Open Data Movement\u0026rdquo; to be a movement. And see also the footnote.14\nItem (2) is harsh. There are many within the \u0026ldquo;Open Data\u0026rdquo; sphere who live in the Civil Liberties area who have made significant contributions to transparency and accountability. But as a net effect, I\u0026rsquo;d stand by the claim – the overall impact of open data initiatives could well be to promote a kind of government that is prone to secrecy, as \u0026ldquo;small government\u0026rdquo; parties have often been.\nItem (3): the co-option is being done by a vocal and influential section of Open Data advocates, but I\u0026rsquo;d definitely hold to the claim that the language of progressive change is being used, and the actions of civil liberties activists used, by some whose agenda is closer to neoliberal than egalitarian.\nIf you are still with me after all that; thanks for reading.\nFootnotes: 1 Harlan Yu and David G.

I appreciate Catherine\u0026rsquo;s robust arguments in the debate, but she does come at this from a very different political point of view to my own, as her comment on Tom Lee\u0026rsquo;s post makes clear.\n14 Aside: David Eaves\u0026rsquo; description of municipal-level civic-hackers (North-West quadrant) in Canada is compelling, but this group of people is also Not a Movement. Now some people claim not to care about the word \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo;, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t then skip back to the main text, but I think it matters.\nThere are many admirable socially and civically beneficial activities that are not movements. Many people coach children\u0026rsquo;s sports teams (I\u0026rsquo;ve done it myself); millions of people take part in such activities, they are committed, involved, and do a lot of civic good, but they do not form a movement: I was a soccer coach, not a public sports activist. Similarly, birdwatching has a long and distinguished history of contributing to social goals (protection of birds and their habitats) and of sharing their observations in socially and scientifically useful ways (my brother Dorset Dipper contributes to the Hertfordshire Bird Atlas) but birdwatching is a hobby, not a movement. This thing about technologists claiming to be a movement is something that, perhaps irrationally, irritates me. Calling \u0026ldquo;Open Data\u0026rdquo; a movement is not quite as daft as calling \u0026ldquo;NoSQL\u0026rdquo; a movement, despite the arguments of O\u0026rsquo;Reilly\u0026rsquo;s Mike Loukides, but to my mind invoking a \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo; is a way to give added weight and significance to activities that may be admirable and useful, but that are ultimately uncontentious: it smacks of self-importance and that rubs me the wrong way.\n15 For a fine description of the economics of cultural products, and the toolboxes that smaller economies have used to maintain cultural diversity, see Blockbusters and Trade Wars by Peter S.

I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it up, but it is too defensive, explains too much, and is too conciliatory given what was thrown at me yesterday.]\nThis morning\u0026rsquo;s post, Why the \u0026ldquo;Open Data Movement\u0026rdquo; is a Joke, attracted more attention than most of what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here. Largely this was a result of a Twitter debate between Evgeny Morozov (@evgenymorozov) and O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Media\u0026rsquo;s Alex Howard (@digiphile). Thanks also to Lorenz Matzat (@lorz) and Ryan Shaw (@rybesh) for arguing broadly in favour of the post.\nAlex Howard hated the piece, calling it \u0026ldquo;ill-informed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;lazy, ignorant writing\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother to cite the relevant scholarship\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;demonstrably incorrect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;laughable\u0026rdquo; and more. He also writes that \u0026ldquo;The author has a habit of writing polemics that include errors or omissions of fact.\u0026rdquo; I am terrible at expressing anything in 140 chars so I\u0026rsquo;ll respond here.\nFirst, it should be obvious that the post was prompted by events here in Canada - and yet no one has actually mentioned any of the Canadian content in any of the comments about the post. This is frustrating. The last five years have been terrible ones for accountability and transparency in this country and yet Canada has just joined and endorsed the Open Government Partnership (link). Does this conjunction say anything about \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo; as a goal? To me it says that a technological \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo; agenda does not indicate a political \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo; agenda, and that \u0026ndash; as I wrote about the Wikileaks cables a year ago (link) \u0026ndash;the fault lines of political beliefs run perpendicular to attitudes about technology, not parallel. So it made me wonder if the idea of open data as a goal for a coherent movement holds water, and whether \u0026ldquo;opening government via technology\u0026rdquo; make sense. To Alex Howard - well I don\u0026rsquo;t really know, because for all his outrage he doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually say anything about the first half of the post or about the events that obviously moved me to write it and led to the frustrated tone I wrote it in.\nBeyond that, he seems to confuse my contention that the idea of open data as a \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo; is a joke with a broader claim that \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo; is a waste of time or that people working on making data open are all dupes. No such thing! Open data can be a fine thing, but I\u0026rsquo;d much rather have a fully-staffed StatsCan charging for data than a half-staffed StatsCan providing it for free. Which would he choose? Obviously a fully-staffed StatsCan providing data for free would be ideal, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like we\u0026rsquo;re getting that any time soon. The UK\u0026rsquo;s Francis Maude, the incoming co-chair of the Open Government Partnership, says that \u0026ldquo;we want to create an army of armchair auditors who can hold government to account\u0026rdquo;. This would be nice, but not at the cost of a real independent auditor.\nI suspect that Alex Howard and I just see the world from different points of view. Que sera, sera. But from what I know the Sunlight Foundation is on the side of the angels so I was disappointed to see that Tom Lee of the Sunlight Foundation considered my post \u0026ldquo;a jumbled mess\u0026rdquo;. I do realize that coalition politics makes strange bedfellows, and that broad coalitions can still be worthwhile, but some tents can be so big that they collapse in a shapeless pile of canvas. I worry that the open data tent is one such, and that the apparent common goals of some people under the canvas hide bigger differences. I share the concerns of Alex Howard\u0026rsquo;s colleague Nat Torkington when he writes this:\n   Obama and his staff, coming from the investment mindset, are building a Gov 2.0 infrastructure that creates a space for economic opportunity, informed citizens, and wider involvement in decision making so the government better reflects the community's will. Cameron and his staff, coming from a cost mindset, are building a Gov 2.0 infrastructure that suggests it will be more about turning government-provided services over to the private sector.    For me, the gap between the two visions is fundamental and makes the idea that these two goals are part of the same movement, well, a joke. The tension/contradiction between commercial and civic interests that these sentences highlight is one division that seems unresolved and yet fundamental.

Largely this was a result of a Twitter debate between Evgeny Morozov (@evgenymorozov) and O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Media\u0026rsquo;s Alex Howard (@digiphile).","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tReactions to 'Why the \"Open Data Movement\" is a Joke'\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Two recent announcements from Canada prompt my mood this morning:\n Canada Joins International Open Government Partnership\n Conservative Cuts put half of Statscan jobs at risk\n  A government can simultaneously be the most secretive, controlling Canadian government in recent memory and be welcomed into the club of \u0026ldquo;open government\u0026rdquo;. The announcements highlight a few problems with the \u0026ldquo;open data movement\u0026rdquo; (Wikipedia page):\n It\u0026rsquo;s not a movement, at least in any reasonable political or cultural sense of the word,\n It\u0026rsquo;s doing nothing for transparency and accountability in government,\n It\u0026rsquo;s co-opting the language of progressive change in pursuit of what turns out to be a small-government-focused subsidy for industry.\n  In short, the open data movement is a joke. Those who are on the political left who lend their support to it have some hard decisions to make.\nThe Canadian Case: Open is an empty word The Harper government\u0026rsquo;s actions around \u0026ldquo;open government\u0026rdquo;, and the lack of any significant consequences for those actions, show just how empty the word \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; has become. For readers outside the country, here is a selection:\n Cancelling the compulsory long-form census (link), thereby demolishing a source of reliable statistical data that guides government decisions and debates over national priorities. \u0026ldquo;The information previously collected by the long-form census questionnaire will be collected as part of the new voluntary National Household Survey (NHS).\u0026rdquo; The decision prompted Statscan head Munir Sheikh to resign (link).\n Firing Health Canada scientists who speak publicly on drug safety issues (link). [Update: as \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo; comments below, this was the Liberal government in 2004]\n Muzzling Canada\u0026rsquo;s public scientists in other departments, with one example being Fisheries and Oceans scientist Kristi Miller (link). More broadly, \u0026ldquo;Natural Resources Canada scientists have had to get pre-approval from Minister Christian Paradis\u0026rsquo;s office to speak with journalists. They must also get ministerial approval for everything they say to the news media.\u0026rdquo; (link).\n  It\u0026rsquo;s got to the stage where the Canadian Association of Journalists recently awarded its \u0026ldquo;Code of Silence\u0026rdquo; award for Canada\u0026rsquo;s most secretive government or publicly-funded agency to the entire federal government (link).\nWhile there has been opposition to these moves, I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that the \u0026ldquo;open data movement\u0026rdquo; has not been central to it. But never mind, Statistics Canada data is now available for free on the government\u0026rsquo;s web site (link). There seems to be no link between the government\u0026rsquo;s actions and the actions of this \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo;, and basically that\u0026rsquo;s because the Open Data Movement is more focused on formats, digitally-acessible data sets, free access to postal codes, and so on than it is focused on actual government transparency around issues that matter. It\u0026rsquo;s a movement that has had no impact on government accountability.\nWho is the Open Data Movement? Am I being unfair? Who, after all, is the Open Data Movement? Well it turns out there isn\u0026rsquo;t one really, at least when it comes to \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo; in the sense of \u0026ldquo;open government data\u0026rdquo;, which along with \u0026ldquo;open scientific data\u0026rdquo; is one of the two most common uses of the term.\n\u0026ldquo;Open Data Movement\u0026rdquo; is a phrase dragged out by media-oriented personalities to cloak a private-sector initiative in the mantle of progressive politics. Along with other cyberculture terms (\u0026ldquo;hacktivism\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;unconferences\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;hackathons\u0026rdquo;) the word \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo; suggests a countercultural grass-roots initiative for social change, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t anything of the sort that I can see.\nTake Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly, who has thrown the phrase around for some time (see here for an example from a couple of years ago). Like others who use the phrase, he sees no conflict between civic culture and corporate interests, so the Strata conferences and Open Government conferences he has run have been sponsored by major software, hardware, and computer services companies (including, I think, my employer, for whom I do not speak). Strata 2012, for example, is co-hosted by Cloudera, sponsored by EMC and MapR, and many others.\nOr take the \u0026ldquo;Code for America\u0026rdquo; initiative, which uses language that is explicitly about promoting an alternative vision of how government works (\u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s about citizenship and how the internet is fundamentally reshaping the way government can work\u0026rdquo;, It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;a Peace Corp for geeks\u0026rdquo;) and which has many well-intentioned people involved. Yet when it comes to it, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more here about making uncontroversial data available (including for commercial use) than there is about anything like challenging government on actual accountability or transparency. So it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that the list of donors includes major corporations like EMC (again), ESRI, Google, O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Media, and Microsoft.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that there\u0026rsquo;s necessarily anything wrong with Code for America, more that it\u0026rsquo;s not a movement in any political or even cultural sense. Another member of the CfA donor list is the Omidyar Network, set up by the eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar, and it reflects his view that private sector corporate profit-making activity and civic activity are not in tension, but complement each other.\nAs a result, the actual activities of this \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo; end up being to push for government subsidies of private-sector activity. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;big society\u0026rdquo; all over again. This is the TED worldview, so it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that the recent Open Government Partnership wraps itself in noble goals such as fighting \u0026ldquo;corruption, closed doors, the consolidation of power\u0026rdquo; (see Hillary Rodham Clinton\u0026rsquo;s remarks) and basks in the reflected virtue of TED fellow Walid Al-Saqaf (Open data vital for a new Yemen) when the most likely outcomes are privatisation initiatives of the kind promoted by Francis Maude.\nAbandoning \u0026ldquo;Free for Commercial Use\u0026rdquo; Progressives involved in open data work, of which there are many, could do something useful here. In order to prevent actions around government transparency being hijacked as a front for corporations to get at subsidised raw material, they could promote a \u0026ldquo;non-commercial use\u0026rdquo; license of the kind that is an option under some variants of Creative Commons content license.\nUntil now, groups and individuals with some credibility on the left have maintained constructive if arms-length relations with the corporate/civic almagam that is the Open Data Movement. It\u0026rsquo;s time for them to draw a line, and not let their own often-admirable initiatives get used as a smokescreen for privatisation and small-government initiatives.\nAre any doing so, or are there explicitly-progressive initiatives that are making a difference? I\u0026rsquo;d be interested to hear.\nMore reading Basically, this post follows on from this and this, which I wrote a couple of years ago.\n","date":1335876375,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"9b4f94cd14907e3ef1674e9b4e5b25f0","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/why-the-open-data-movement-is-a-joke/","publishdate":"2012-05-01T12:46:15Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-the-open-data-movement-is-a-joke/","section":"post","summary":"Two recent announcements from Canada prompt my mood this morning:\n Canada Joins International Open Government Partnership\n Conservative Cuts put half of Statscan jobs at risk\n  A government can simultaneously be the most secretive, controlling Canadian government in recent memory and be welcomed into the club of \u0026ldquo;open government\u0026rdquo;.

It\u0026rsquo;s a review of an essay collection called \u0026ldquo;The Reputation Society\u0026rdquo;, edited by Hassan Massum and Mark Tovey. Unfortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the book much. The concluding paragraph of my review is this:\n   There is a need for inventive and serious thought about the issues of reputation and trust in an increasingly digital world. Our social and commercial interactions will be increasingly mediated by large-scale software systems, and we need ideas about how best to design, navigate and regulate these systems. Unfortunately, by avoiding real-world cases and thorny problems, The Reputation Society provides no answers.    My starting point for the review, although it\u0026rsquo;s not explicit in the essay, is that information asymmetry is at the heart of anything to do with trust, reputation, and the market; and despite what some optimists claim, sheer volume of opinions does not solve the problem. Recently, I even deleted this paragraph from the Wikipedia article on Information Asymmetry:\n   Although information asymmetry has recently been noted to be on the decline with the rise of the internet, which allows ignorant users to acquire hitherto unavailable information such as the costs of competing insurance policies, or the price of used cars, it is still heavily applied to human resource and personnel economics regarding incentive schemes when the employer cannot continually observe worker effort.    \u0026ldquo;The costs of competing insurance policies, or the price of used cars\u0026rdquo; has nothing to do with information asymmetry. The question is, how do you know if I\u0026rsquo;m telling the truth, when I have an incentive to distort it? How can we establish trust?\nWikipedia itself provides a useful case study. For many topics there is little incentive for a contributor to provide false information beyond the thrill of vandalism, and the fact that such vandalism can be undone with a single click means that trust is not a significant issue throughout many parts of the encyclopedia. Why would anyone lie about the birth date of Henry III of Castile being 4 October 1379? As a result, \u0026ldquo;anyone can edit\u0026rdquo; applies and the encyclopedia has become the phenomenon it is.\nThere is a small number of pages (several thousand of the 3.3 million in English Wikipedia, or 0.1%) that are the subject of repeated edit wars, and which \u0026ldquo;are semi-protected to reduce the risk of inappropriate editing\u0026rdquo;. The policies and practices around these pages have undergone continual revision (Seth Finkelstein will know more) and the costs of maintaining neutrality are high; one way or another, when there is a conflict of interest, it needs special treatment.\nWhen it comes to reputation, there\u0026rsquo;s always a conflict of interest. A hotel has an interest in promoting its own image, and in worsening the image of its competitors. Simply throwing open the floodgates doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve this basic problem, and the paragraphs on TripAdvisor at LRC explain why. (That said, I have no doubt my cousin\u0026rsquo;s place Riad Africa, in Marrakesh, is indeed a wonderful place to stay).\nOn the web, as elsewhere, there will be many ways explored to solve the proble of trust. Angie\u0026rsquo;s List takes an approach that is almost the opposite of TripAdvisor in its reviews of contractors and services: it requires membership, and all reviews are checked by a human. A result is that, success or not, Angie\u0026rsquo;s List is run much more like non-web reputation services: restaurant review guides, holiday home guides, and so on. If the main benefits of the web are free-for-all Wikipedia-style contributions, then it remains to be seen how reliable it can be for issues like reputation, where conflict of interest and asymmetric information are the sticking points.\n","date":1333726703,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"7e8ba8582d555e86545bb4e9ed0d0995","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/click-to-judge/","publishdate":"2012-04-06T15:38:23Z","relpermalink":"/post/click-to-judge/","section":"post","summary":"I recently contributed an essay to the always-excellent Literary Review of Canada, which is out in the April issue and is one of the contributions that they have put online so you can read it in its entirety for free here, you lucky people.

The Mathew Ingram article is indented.\n   Thanks to the rise self-publishing tools, from Amazon’s Kindle platform to Apple’s iAuthor software, anyone who wants to write a book can do so and theoretically reach an audience of millions — as self-publishing superstars [such as Amanda Hocking and John Locke have shown](http://gigaom.com/2011/06/20/future-of-media-the-rise-of-the-million-selling-kindle-author/).    This is meaningless. In one sense it\u0026rsquo;s been the case for a hundred years that \u0026ldquo;anyone\u0026hellip;can..reach an audience of millions\u0026rdquo;. You didn\u0026rsquo;t even have to go through a publisher (Virginia Woolf). But for most people, going through a publisher is easier than self-promotion, which for most people is very very difficult. So to claim \u0026ldquo;anyone\u0026rdquo; can self-publish to millions is just ridiculous. We can write off Salinger, Pynchon, Harper Lee, Samuel Becket, or Cormac McCarthy for a start. Promotion (not to mention editing and more) takes a certain kind of person. Not everyone can do it. I can\u0026rsquo;t.\n   But this explosion of amateur authors and publishers also means a lot more competition for an audience.    I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, \u0026ldquo;amateur authors\u0026rdquo;?? Most authors have always been amateur in the sense of not having a regular job as an author. If Amanda Hocking is an amateur (income from her books, millions) and I\u0026rsquo;m a professional (income from my book, hundreds) then someone is looking at the world upside down. Plus, in the first paragraph MI is implicitly claiming that it\u0026rsquo;s easier than ever to reach an audience, and in this paragraph he\u0026rsquo;s saying it\u0026rsquo;s harder than ever (more competition). Make your mind up Mathew!\n   So how do writers make money? First of all, according to author and marketer Seth Godin, [they have to give up the idea that they somehow deserve to be paid](http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2012/interview-seth-godin-on-libraries-literary-agents-and-the-future-of-book-publishing-as-we-know-it/) for their writing.    It\u0026rsquo;s straw man time. Who are these authors? I know several authors, and none who feels the sense of entitlement of which Godin accuses them.\n   In a recent interview with Digital Book World, the writer and creator of the Domino Project — a joint publishing venture with Amazon that he recently wound up — was [asked about his advice that authors should give their books away for free](http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2012/interview-seth-godin-on-libraries-literary-agents-and-the-future-of-book-publishing-as-we-know-it/) and that they should worry more about spreading their message and building a fan base instead of focusing on how to monetize it right away.    This is a model that will work for a very few people, but for most will fail. It\u0026rsquo;s bad advice.\n   And how would he respond to writers concerned about their ability to make a living from their writing? Godin’s response:     Who said you have a right to cash money from writing? Poets don’t get paid (often), but there’s no poetry shortage. The future is going to be filled with amateurs, and the truly talented and persistent will make a great living. But the days of journeyman writers who make a good living by the word — over.    Anyone who thinks \u0026ldquo;the truly talented and persistent will make a great living\u0026rdquo; should have talked to Vincent Van Gogh. Are there still Van Gogh\u0026rsquo;s in today\u0026rsquo;s world? Of course - we just don\u0026rsquo;t know who they are.\nPerhaps musicians should look to digital royalties? Sadly no. Making money online is a winner-take-all competition, a few will get very rich (and luck has a big say in that, as the well-known Watts-Salganik experiments proved), but most will get somewhere between little and nothing.\n   This probably isn’t the kind of message that most authors (or creative professionals of any kind) want to hear, but that doesn’t make it any less true. The rise of the amateur, powered by the democratization of distribution provided by the Web and social media, is something that is disrupting virtually every form of content that can be converted into bits.    This is a mix of two poses. First there\u0026rsquo;s hard-headed realism: the old world is gone, with a sympathetic wave of the hand. Then there\u0026rsquo;s blind faith that everything is for the best in the best of digital worlds and please don\u0026rsquo;t mention that \u0026ldquo;the rise of the amateur\u0026rdquo; is also \u0026ldquo;the rise of the plutocrat\u0026rdquo; (Bezos, Zuckerberg, Jobs) and \u0026ldquo;the democratization of distribution\u0026rdquo; is also \u0026ldquo;the monopolization of profits\u0026rdquo; in the hands of the aggregators. If you promote your work through Twitter, it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;direct\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s mediated by Twitter, and it\u0026rsquo;s as well to remember that. If you self-publish on Amazon then Amazon is your publisher.\n   To take just two examples, the news industry is struggling to adapt to [an era where anyone can commit “random acts of journalism”](http://gigaom.com/2011/11/18/what-happens-when-journalism-is-everywhere/) with a blog or smartphone -    \u0026ldquo;Random acts of journalism\u0026rdquo; sounds cool and fun, but cute phrases don\u0026rsquo;t make reality. Matthew Hindman actually did some hard looking into the democratization of the media and concluded that the spectrum of voices getting heard now is narrower, if anything, than pre-Internet. The rise of the amateur citizen journalist is only half the story. (My comments on Hindman here: self-promotion!) Here is Hindman:\n   _From the beginning, the Internet has been portrayed as a media Robin Hood - robbing audience from the big print and broadcast outlets and giving it to the little guys. But the data in this chapter suggest that audiences are moving in both directions. On the one hand, the news market in cyberspace seems even more concentrated on the top ten or twenty outlets than print media is. On the other, the tiniest outlets have indeed earned a substantial portion of the total eyeballs... It is the middle-class outlets that have seen relative decline in the online world. Moreover, it is overwhelmingly smaller, local media organizations that have lost out to national sources. (p.100)_    And back to Mathew Ingram:\n   — and where sources of news have the ability to publish their own content instead of [having to go through a middleman](http://gigaom.com/2012/01/30/is-it-good-for-journalism-when-sources-go-direct/) — and photography [has been battling](http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/22/opinion/phones-instagram-apps-stern/index.html) the rise of the amateur for years now.    The \u0026ldquo;having to go through a middleman\u0026rdquo; link is to a piece about Rupert Murdoch opening a Twitter account. No longer does Rupert have to go through a middleman! Three cheers for the democratization of distribution! There are many sources of inequality, and attention is one. No one publicizes Jane Minor Author\u0026rsquo;s twitter account, but Rupe - well he\u0026rsquo;s different.\n   [![](http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/4826939037_3c18d7cc92_z.png?w=210\u0026h=140)](http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/4826939037_3c18d7cc92_z.png)    Nice picture.\n   The crucial principle at work in all of these areas is the idea that your real competition isn’t the book or news outlet that is better than you; it’s the one that is good enough for a majority of your audience.     So maybe the [Huffington Post version of that news story isn’t as good as the one in the _New York Times_](http://gigaom.com/2012/02/22/are-aggregation-and-curation-journalism-wrong-question/), but it is good enough for many readers. And maybe those vampire books by Amanda Hocking or the detective novels from million-selling author John Locke aren’t as good as yours, but for hundreds of thousands of weekend readers they are probably good enough.    So on the one hand we hear that \u0026ldquo;the truly talented and persistent\u0026rdquo; can still make money, but now we hear that quality isn\u0026rsquo;t the issue. Well, one way or another I\u0026rsquo;m sure the new world will be just dandy. And what is that way?\n   Godin’s point isn’t that you _can’t_ make money; it’s [that you have to think differently](http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2012/interview-seth-godin-on-libraries-literary-agents-and-the-future-of-book-publishing-as-we-know-it/) about how to accomplish that task.     If you’re a mystery writer, can you find 1000 true fans to pay a hundred dollars a year each to get an ongoing serial from you?    The \u0026ldquo;1000 true fans\u0026rdquo; reference is to a Kevin Kelly daydream from 2008 (*). Plausible, but if it sounds like a plan to you, first read John Scalzi and then tell me that\u0026rsquo;s the path you\u0026rsquo;re going to take.\n   It’s not the market’s job to tell authors how to monetize their work. The market doesn’t care. If there’s no scarcity of what they want, it’s hard to get them to pay for it.    The idea, implicit here, is that the market gives people what they want. Let\u0026rsquo;s just agree to differ on that one.\n   Who says that artists have a right to make money?    No one I know. I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the next few paragraphs.\n   As media theorist Clay Shirky has pointed out before, [abundance breaks a lot of content-related business models that were built on scarcity](http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/06/clay-shirkys-cognitive-surplus-is-creating-and-sharing-always-a-more-moral-choice-than-consuming/), and that includes the ones that have supported the book-publishing industry for so long.    My response to the Clay Shirky piece on content-related business models is here.\n   That’s why publishers have been scrambling to try to lock down their content — including [jacking up the prices that libraries pay for e-books](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-random-house-sharply-increases-library-e-book-prices/) — and it’s why authors who have a built-in audience are using the Web to connect directly with that audience.    You really want to talk about locking down content while pointing to publishing on Amazon and iBooks as a way forward? Come on Mr. Ingram, you know better than that.\n   Godin’s message may not be a popular one, but it is the way that content works now.    Again with the hard-headed technological inevitability. But politics, law, and culture has a lot to do with the way that content works. I have hopes that there will be room for many publishing models, with a collection of models - digital and physical. But the biggest threat to a diversity of revenue streams is a reliance on a single deterministic future governed by Amazon, Apple and Google. Fortunately, resistance to Silicon Valley\u0026rsquo;s increasingly disconnected rhetoric is growing, and I think there are still more constructive possibilities for would-be authors than Seth Godin\u0026rsquo;s self-help, positive-thinking brand of marketing.\n","date":1331159582,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d8e85ba59f1e896ba0ca8e7d6aa5872f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/wikibollocks-mathew-ingram-and-seth-godin-on-publishing/","publishdate":"2012-03-07T22:33:02Z","relpermalink":"/post/wikibollocks-mathew-ingram-and-seth-godin-on-publishing/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s most of Matthew Ingram\u0026rsquo;s article about a Seth Godin interview with added intemperate and unedited and probably ill-judged commentary from yours truly.

Other things you may want to read about this book include Tom Stafford\u0026rsquo;s Why Sherry Turkle is So Wrong and Mr. Teacup\u0026rsquo;s review.]\nSlippery words: caring and conversation\nWhen I started reading Alone Together, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to end up wondering what a conversation is, but that\u0026rsquo;s what happened, so that\u0026rsquo;s what you get here. Spoiler: my wondering wandered in a circle, first agreeing with Turkle, then disagreeing a little, then a lot, until I ended up largely agreeing with her again.\nWhat do you think about a seventy-two-year-old woman, Miriam, finding comfort in telling stories toParo, a furry machine designed to care for the elderly and infirm?\n\u0026ldquo;Care for?\u0026rdquo; Turkle writes, \u0026ldquo;Paro took care of Miriam\u0026rsquo;s desire to tell her story – it made a space for that story to be told – but it did not care about her or her story\u0026rdquo; {106}. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the word cares that Turkle objects to, but also the word conversation. \u0026ldquo;To say that Miriam was having a conversation with Paro, as these people [Paro\u0026rsquo;s designers] do, is to forget what it is to have a conversation\u0026rdquo; {107}.\nTurkle worries about these inauthentic conversations partly because we are so easily seduced by the appearance of caring. We read caring into the actions of robots at the first opportunity, even when we know better. When a robot called Domo simply touches its designer, Aaron Edsinger, he says that \u0026ldquo;there is a part of me that is trying to say, well, Domo cares.\u0026rdquo; Turkle concludes: \u0026ldquo;We can interact with robots in full knowledge of their limitations, comforted nonetheless by what must be an unrequited love.\u0026rdquo; {133}\nRob Horning writes that Turkle has always been concerned with the way that \u0026ldquo;Users begin to transfer programming metaphors to their interactions with people and psychological metaphors to the behavior of machines.\u0026rdquo; She believes that authenticity is important (real caring, real conversations with real people) and that technology is replacing the authentic with the fake. As she tells the stories—the robot ones anyway, the network ones less so—I can\u0026rsquo;t help but agree with Turkle. Caring robots may be seductive, but in the end their companionship is a deception and should be avoided.\nAuthenticity: if you can fake that etc There\u0026rsquo;s a catch in Turkle\u0026rsquo;s argument, which many others have noticed: many \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; conversations are not authentic either. Horning takes this point to the extreme: \u0026ldquo;Nobody can ever show you their \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; self.\u0026rdquo; Turkle\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;concern with authenticity is an expression of nostalgia\u0026rdquo;, and authenticity is \u0026ldquo;a pressing personal issue now for many not because it has been suddenly lost\u0026rdquo; but because it is being lost in new and different ways thanks to digital networks. Authenticity itself is not what it used to be.\nI kind of agree with Horning. Even without taking it to that extreme, we clearly spend much of our day in inauthentic interactions, robots or no robots. When the cashier says \u0026ldquo;Have a nice day\u0026rdquo;, is it the voice of the cashier or the company whose policy they are following? Small-talk and passing greetings are more the enacting of social scripts than authentic exchanges of emotions or views. The scripted responses of call-centre employees just waiting to be replaced by a cheaper technology are obviously inauthentic. The coffee machine at work even tells me to \u0026ldquo;enjoy your beverage\u0026rdquo; and I don\u0026rsquo;t really mind that. Where does inauthenticity become a problem?\nEven Turkle\u0026rsquo;s own profession by training (psychoanalyst) has always seemed to me to have a big dose of inauthenticity to it. As a man of a certain age from the north of England the whole \u0026ldquo;talking about feelings\u0026rdquo; thing is foreign to me, and as a leftist the idea that markets alienate people from their work is easy to identify with. So I remember being shocked when I first came across people going to therapists in the 1980\u0026rsquo;s. If you do need to talk to someone about your problems, I thought, you should at least do it with friends or family. Going to a counsellor is a bit like going to a prostitute, I thought: paying for something you should get out of affection. You may talk with them, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a real conversation. It\u0026rsquo;s not authentic.\nTo be fair, Turkle has heard all this before and acknowledges that \u0026ldquo;We assign caring roles to people who may not care at all.\u0026rdquo; When a nurse at a hospital takes our hand during an operation, does it matter if the gesture is rote? {133} The market has moved us closer to what she calls \u0026ldquo;the robotic moment\u0026rdquo;, when certain kinds of interaction are ready to be automated. We know it\u0026rsquo;s not a real person at the other end, so why not just replace them with a machine anyway.\nSo if a nurse\u0026rsquo;s hand is OK, but a robot\u0026rsquo;s is problematic, what about when people receive comfort over networks? Is this inauthenticity any worse than that of the market? The market brings new forms of inauthentic interaction into our lives all the time: people who use the language of caring but who are just doing a job. Personal trainers, massage therapists, and all the way to automated voice systems. Or how about conversations while drunk (are we really ourselves?) or how about talking to someone using antidepressants to get through the day (is that really them speaking?) Inauthenticity is everywhere.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a conversation? So I started to disagree with Turkle about authenticity and its importance. Next up, the idea of a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; conversation. A later chapter of Alone Together, about the online confessional site PostSecret (link), made me reconsider my initial agreement with Turkle on this. Maybe Miriam, telling her story to Paro, is not looking for what we think of as a conversation anyway, so much as an opportunity for \u0026ldquo;unburdening\u0026rdquo;, and unburdening has its own dynamics.\nAn example. Sixteen months after physicist Richard Feynman\u0026rsquo;s first wife Arline died of cancer, Feynman – a convinced atheist and one of the most consistent denouncers of fuzzy thinking on record \u0026ndash; nevertheless wrote a moving love letter addressed to her (link). \u0026ldquo;I thought there was no sense to writing. But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and what I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you.\u0026rdquo; .\nThe letter served an important purpose for Feynman. His daughter Michelle notes that it was well worn: Feynman had re-read it often. There were things he needed to say, and even though Arline was not there to hear them he needed to address these things to her. Feynman\u0026rsquo;s letter is a way to speak out loud (yet in private) to an audience that is important (yet not present). It\u0026rsquo;s sort of a conversation, but also not, and that\u0026rsquo;s the way that unburdening often works.\nSome forms of unburdening have become formalized and surrounded by ritual. Take the Catholic confession: it takes place in a private space, behind a curtain; there is a barrier between the penitent and the priest that serves to emphasize the distance between the two; the solemn ritual surrounding confession serves to emphasize a commitment to privacy, so that the penitent can speak out loud to an audience that is barely there, knowing that what he or she says will go no further.\nPsychoanalysis has taken on many of the same characteristics as confession. The quiet office formalizes the encounter. The guarantees of privacy are emphasized. The patient lies on a couch and the therapist sits out of sight so that the patient is as close to alone as possible. Again, in order to speak things that really matter, we seek an audience of almost zero.\nEven in less formal settings, unburdening is most commonly carried out by expressing intimate thoughts out loud (on paper, on a screen, or by voice) but to an audience that does not know us intimately. How many people have told secrets to strangers they will never meet again? People talk to their pets. Sometimes unburdening has no audience at all; for centuries, private diaries have been receptacles for sorrows and a place to work out problems and dreams. These are the most private of public gestures: secrets we whisper aloud and then lock up, needing to speak them but not wanting them to be heard.\nThe posting of confessions to PostSecret is another form of unburdening, of speaking without full conversation. In this case anonymity hides the identity of the penitent, and the role of the priest is taken by the readers and commenters on the site. The site has its own rituals; you don\u0026rsquo;t e-mail your secrets, you must mail a physical postcard with your secret (as it passes through the mail system, it is visible - another anonymous disclosure).\nTurkle sees many acts of unburdening as somehow less than satisfactory. \u0026ldquo;On the face of it, there are crucial differences between talking to human readers on a confessional site and to a machine that can have no idea of what a confession is. That the two contexts provoke similar reactions points to their similarities. Confessing to a website and talking to a robot deemed \u0026lsquo;therapeutic\u0026rsquo; both emphasize getting something \u0026lsquo;out\u0026rsquo;. Each act makes the same claim: bad feelings become less toxic when released. Each takes as its promise the notion that you can deal with feelings without dealing directly with a person. In each, something that is less than conversation begins to seem like conversation. Venting feelings comes to feel like sharing them\u0026rdquo; {231}\nIt seems to me that she is understating the benefits that unburdening can provide, and missing the long history of practices that surround the act, for good reason. There is more to unburdening than \u0026ldquo;bad feelings become less toxic when released\u0026rdquo;, and more to it than a simple venting; it\u0026rsquo;s just that what we seek is not always conversation. We should pay attention to gestures like Feynman\u0026rsquo;s.\n Aside: Unburdening and anonymity\n  There is much talk about speech, anonymity and privacy on the Internet, but sometimes our ideas of speech and what it is for are too narrow and this steers the debate off the rails. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s the information-centric view of dialogue as information exchange that blinds some people to the other purposes of speech, but acts such as unburdening need to be thought of differently. There is an idea (see Eric Schmidt\u0026rsquo;s famous \u0026ldquo;If you have something that you don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing it in the first place\u0026rdquo;, or Douglas Rushkoff in his recent \u0026ldquo;Program or be Programmed\u0026rdquo;) that so long as we are honest with what we say, then privacy is not that big a worry. But it\u0026rsquo;s not only stupid mistakes or criminal/offensive acts that we don\u0026rsquo;t want out there in public, associated with our names. Unburdening is just one kind of speech that needs to be private for completely legitimate reasons, and that we need to be able to enter into knowing that its consequences are limited.\nWhat is conversation for? Perhaps, I wondered, unburdening is one form of conversation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a full participant on the other end. The point is sometimes to hear ourselves speak. A friend of mine at work had a teaching assistant in a science lab class who said \u0026ldquo;you can ask me any question you want, but first you have to ask the bear\u0026rdquo;. The bear was a teddy bear sitting on a filing cabinet. It was surprising, my friend says, how many students asked the bear their question, and then realised they didn\u0026rsquo;t need to ask the teaching assistant.\nSo then, why does it matter if it\u0026rsquo;s a robot, a dog, a diary or a teddy bear on a filing cabinet if what we want is to just use speech to work out some problem or explore some emotion? Turkle writes \u0026ldquo;How can I talk about sibling rivalry to something that never had a mother?\u0026rdquo; {19} But a diary doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a mother, and a dog doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand what you are talking about, and people have used diaries and dogs to sort out sibling rivalry problems for centuries.\nBack to where I started So there I was, disagreeing with Turkle about authenticity and about conversation. Yet the more I think about it, the more I am coming round to agreeing with her (on the robots anyway), for a mixture of reasons.\nOne is what I think of as the \u0026ldquo;postmodern mistake\u0026rdquo;. Postmodernism takes things we think of as certain and shakes them up, showing us that foundations we thought were solid are in fact wobbly. But sometimes it leaps from \u0026ldquo;everything is uncertain\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;everything is equally uncertain\u0026rdquo; and that just ain\u0026rsquo;t so. Is there a well-defined border between India and Pakistan? No, but we can still talk unambiguously about \u0026ldquo;India\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Pakistan\u0026rdquo; despite that. A little fuzziness doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we have to abandon everything.\nSo conversations with checkout workers are inauthentic, and conversations with robots are inauthentic, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them equally inauthentic. The limits of a robot are orders of magnitude more constrained than even the most robotic of phone-call workers. In \u0026ldquo;Everything is Obvious\u0026rdquo;, Duncan Watts explains how Artificial Intelligence has been more challenging than its proponents believed because, in attempting to design intelligent machines, they failed to realize what was relevant. The fact that we are so ready to add meaning to robot actions will lead interactions rapidly into unexpected and problematic areas.\nWhy am I so pessimistic that the interactions will be \u0026ldquo;problematic\u0026rdquo;? Because the robots we may see soon will be commercial products, and that means they will have an agenda. Rob Horning has the same worry about networks; in his final paragraph he writes \u0026ldquo;The problem is that we believe that we construct this social-media identity autonomously and that it is therefore our responsibility, our fault if it’s limited. The social-media companies have largely succeeded in persuading users of their platforms’ neutrality. What we fail to see is that these new identities are no less contingent and dictated to us then the ones circumscribed by tradition; only now the constraints are imposed by for-profit companies in explicit service of gain.\u0026rdquo; In the same way that the algorithms of social networking sites have a straightforward agenda (keep us on the site, to maximize advertising exposure), so robots will have a straightforward agenda (cost effectiveness, keeping old people occupied, and so on) that will not be obvious to us as we interact with them.\nThe other problem I see, which applies to networks and to robots, is their uniformity. People have their faults, but different people have different faults, and so humanity as a whole is not dragged down any single rabbit hole. The introduction of global communications media that have very specific (and limited) formats (the text message, the tweet) cannot but have a homogenizing effect on our interactions.\nBut these conclusions are not so important, and I could be talked out of them. What\u0026rsquo;s more important about the book is the unexpected avenues it leads you down. I\u0026rsquo;d rather have a book that prompts a week or two of thought than one that gives me the answers I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. I\u0026rsquo;d rather a book with the foibles of a human conversation than the reassuring, stress-free interactions of a robot, and Alone Together was such a book for me.\n","date":1328908065,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1f3bb448f677c725f36b0498f8f81123","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/alone-together-ii-unburdening/","publishdate":"2012-02-10T21:07:45Z","relpermalink":"/post/alone-together-ii-unburdening/","section":"post","summary":"[After my first Alone Together post (link), about how much I like Sherry Turkle\u0026rsquo;s use of closely-observed stories, the prolific Rob Horning, now of The New Inquiry among other things, wrote a companion piece (link) on Authenticity, which this post follows.

They tend to become slogans. They tend to be on the right side of things: ecology or vegetarianism or antiwar. All these are wonderful ideas but I like to work on a song until those slogans, as wonderful as they are and as wholesome as the ideas they promote are, dissolve into deeper convictions of the heart. I never set out to write a didactic song. It's just my experience. All I've got to put in a song is my own experience.    The same is true of fiction. Songs and stories are powerful ways of communicating, but literature with an agenda is almost always bad literature, stories with a message are almost always shallow morality tales, and the fables that now pepper popular non-fiction books are often particularly egregious examples. Thomas Friedman\u0026rsquo;s taxi drivers and Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s hush puppies are the 21st-century template for books on management, business, economics, politics, and technology only because even badly-told stories seduce us.\nWhenever I encounter a story in a non-fiction book my guard goes up, whether it\u0026rsquo;s fictional or a retelling of an actual event. I know that I am being presented with a Trojan horse; there\u0026rsquo;s a message hidden inside and the only reason for telling me the story is to sneak that message past my defenses of scepticism and logic. It\u0026rsquo;s a trick, and critical readers must reject it. At some point the tables will turn and the telling of non-fiction tales will be recognized as the dishonest, slippery tactic that it is, but for now we must simply resist them and the invading armies that they are smuggling. Which makes it all the more surprising that I loved Sherry Turkle\u0026rsquo;s Alone Together, because it is full of stories.\nMore precisely, I loved the first half of the book, devoted to observing how humans react to robots that react to humans. In Part Two she observes humans reacting to other humans through the medium of digital networks and is less successful. Her use of stories is one reason why Part One works and Part Two fails, so lets stay with the robots and Part One for now.\nFirst, if you are going to use stories you might as well tell them well and Turkle does so. She has an eye for a telling phrase that sets her apart from most non-fiction writers. From a robot that \u0026ldquo;develops its own origami of lovemaking positions\u0026rdquo; to the titles and subtitles of the book, she coins phrases that evoke the contradictions and tensions that are her subjects. \u0026ldquo;Alone together\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The robotic moment: in solitude, new intimacies\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Networked: in intimacy, new solitudes\u0026rdquo;.\nSecond, the stories are not archetypes conjured up simply to illustrate a point, but emerge from the extensive observational work Turkle has done: more than 700 interviews over 30 years, decades of bringing robots to schools and nursing homes, sending them home with children for weeks at a time, watching participants interact with robots and watching herself also. \u0026ldquo;I think of the product as an intimate ethnography\u0026rdquo; she writes {xiii} and the credibility of the book comes from this longstanding and far-reaching work.\nMore importantly, in Part One she uses stories to provoke questions, rather than to provide answers. Consider two examples.\nEarly on, Turkle writes of visiting the American Museum of Natural History with her then-teenaged daughter Rebecca. They approach an exhibit of two giant tortoises from the Galapagos Islands. Rebecca looks at the one visible, motionless, creature and declares \u0026ldquo;They could have used a robot\u0026rdquo;.\nTurkle was taken aback, and started a discussion with other parents and children in the line-up. Several of the children shared Rebecca\u0026rsquo;s concern for the animal and her unimpressed reaction to its authenticity: it would be better for the tortoise itself not to have been brought all this way; a robot would not make the water dirty; \u0026ldquo;for what they do, you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to have the live ones.\u0026rdquo; The parents disagree: \u0026ldquo;The point is that they are real. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I like is that the story does not deliver a message, but instead prompts questions in the mind of the reader. In this way, despite its factual origin, the story is more fictional/literary than many. Does authenticity matter? If so, under what circumstances, and why? It\u0026rsquo;s the open-ended nature of the event that makes reading Alone Together an active, questioning experience, and one I found very rich.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not to say Turkle doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a message to deliver. She does, and she is clear enough about what it is: \u0026ldquo;I am a psychoanalytically trained psychologist. By both temperament and profession, I place high value on relationships of intimacy and authenticity.\u0026rdquo; {6} The book is about Turkle\u0026rsquo;s increasing concern, after years of enthusiasm, that social technologies are serving to erode these qualities.\nThe second story is one that has stayed with me because it gets right to the heart of the issues the book raises around authenticity {74}. Visiting Japan in the early 1990s, Turkle heard tales of adult children who, too distant and too busy to visit their aging and infirm parents, hired actors to visit in their stead, playing the part of the adult child. What\u0026rsquo;s more, the parents appreciated and enjoyed the gesture. It\u0026rsquo;s slightly shocking to western sensibilities, but once we hear a little more context it becomes more understandable.\nFirst, the actors are not (in all cases, at least) a deception: the parents recognize them for what they are. Yet the parents \u0026ldquo;enjoyed the company and played the game\u0026rdquo;. In Japan, being elderly is a role, being a child is a role, and parental visits have a strong dose of ritual to them: the recital of scripts by each party. While the child may not be able to act out their role, at least this way the parent gets to enact theirs, and so to reinforce their identity as an elderly, respected person.\nThe story, again, provokes questions in the mind of the reader rather than leading us to a staged conclusion: questions about authenticity, when it matters, and why. Turkle\u0026rsquo;s reaction was \u0026ldquo;if you are willing to send an actor, why not send a robot?\u0026rdquo; If it does not matter that the visitor is really a child does it matter if the visitor is really a visitor? Does it matter if the visitor is not really visiting (a phone call)? Or why, as my wife asked, should we see this as less than a visit when we could see it instead as more than a bunch of flowers?\nTo me, the story and the questions it prompts undermine my confidence in my own judgements: to make me realise that they are more tied up with cultural conventions, more arbitrary and more shallow, than I thought. And if prompting reflection is the point, then that\u0026rsquo;s OK because the story is, again, open ended: it is not hiding a pre-planned answer.\nPart Two of Alone Together fails because Turkle\u0026rsquo;s interviews and observations focus on bringing out our discontents (new solitudes) with networking technologies. She has a message, and it\u0026rsquo;s one we can either agree with or argue with, but by approaching this part in terms of discontents she fails to escape being didactic. The slogans have not dissolved, in Cohen\u0026rsquo;s words.\nPart One succeeds because it explores the \u0026ldquo;new intimacies\u0026rdquo;: what is surprisingly seductive about interacting with even the most crude and obviously artificial robots. It\u0026rsquo;s this seduction that is so unsettling: the notion that things are \u0026ldquo;alive enough\u0026rdquo; for a given kind of relationship; that the most powerful thing a robot can do is to have needs which we can meet.\nThere is something of a taboo against robots in Western societies. In the last few years we have grown to accept human-sounding artificial voices (the iPhone\u0026rsquo;s Siri being the latest) but we shy away from artifical human appearance. We permit robots as toys and vacuum cleaners, but their use as companions for the aged or as visible service employees is still outside the realm of the every day (at least for now). Interacting with a visible robot is still a novel experience for those of us outside childhood, and so Part One of Alone Together has a sense of a report from a slightly alien future. What she shows us is how vulnerable we are to the seductions of even the most crude simulations, and for unexpected reasons, and the disquiet this provokes is something worth reflecting on. Taboos are vulnerable to suddenly being washed away, and the technological imperative may yet carry us forward into a world where robots are more commonly present. I share Turkle\u0026rsquo;s concern about what impact that will have. More on that next time.\n","date":1327072001,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0fd57c1ca9b92713f601b4b0317c4a44","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/alone-together-1-stories/","publishdate":"2012-01-20T15:06:41Z","relpermalink":"/post/alone-together-1-stories/","section":"post","summary":"[The first of a few reflections prompted by Sherry Turkle\u0026rsquo;s Alone Together.]\nThe sublime Leonard Cohen in today\u0026rsquo;s Guardian:\n   I don't really like songs with ideas.

You can also watch the lecture on YouTube (*). Ethan Zuckerman (EZ) has a long and admirable history of involvement in digital activism and a wide knowledge of both technology and social change; the lecture is worth an hour of your time. But (you knew there was a but) in the end I have to disagree with his main thesis.\n1 Dry Tunisian Tinder EZ tells us how, after years of sporadic and failed protests in Tunisia, one particular spark in the city of Sidi Bouzid blossomed into the forest fire of revolution. When Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest at official interference with his vegetable stall it was a dramatic and desperate act, but not unique: he wasn\u0026rsquo;t the first person to do so even that year. What was different this time?\nEZ\u0026rsquo;s argument is that digital social media was different. The early protest was captured on video using a cheap phone and posted to a social networking site where… it did NOT \u0026ldquo;go viral\u0026rdquo;. Instead the video was picked up by Tunisians outside the country (including EZ\u0026rsquo;s friend Sami ben Gharbia1), who were scanning Tunisian web content for political news and curating it on a site called nawaat.org (*).\nAl Jazeera got the video from nawaat.org and broadcast it back into Tunisia; Tunisians found out in turn what was going on from Al Jazeera. What\u0026rsquo;s important here, says EZ, is that the new low-cost participatory media is an essential part of a larger media ecosystem that helped to stir up feelings within Tunisia.\n2 Cute Cats and Malaysian Opposition In the 1990s EZ ran a web site called Tripod for college/university students. Surprisingly, many people used it not for the Worthy Purposes he and his colleagues had planned, but to share simple and casual things, like pictures of cute cats. Also surprisingly, some of the heaviest use came from Malaysia. Wondering what was going on, Zuckerman got the Malay content translated, only to find that his site was hosting the Malaysian opposition Reformasi movement (*). Tripod was a space that was difficult for the Malaysian government to censor while being easy to hold discussions.2\nAnd so we reach the \u0026ldquo;cute cat theory\u0026rdquo;: the ideal places for those who suddenly have important, politically sensitive material they want to share are sites designed for sharing videos and pictures of \u0026ldquo;cute cats\u0026rdquo; (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr). These sites are easy to use, have a wide reach, and are difficult to censor – if the government shuts them down it annoys a lot of people and alerts them that something interesting is going on. \u0026ldquo;Cute cats\u0026rdquo; sites are natural tinder boxes for revolutionary sparks.\nThe events EZ recounts are compelling, but a lot of compelling things happen in this strange world, so my first thoughts whenever I hear a story of the Internet producing some unique chain of events is: can I think of a non-Internet example that matches? So here is the lunch-room theory of political dissent (details from here). 3 Polish lunch rooms On July 8, 1980, in the lunch room at a transport equipment plant in the eastern Polish town of Swidnik, the price of a pork cutlet jumped from 10.20 zloty to 18.10. For Miroslaw Kaczan, this jump was the final straw, and after lunch he switched off the machines he was working on. Others in Department 320 joined him, and other departments in the factory were quick to join. Soon there was a factory-wide stoppage, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about pork cutlets: the demands of the protesters revealed a wealth of pent-up frustration.\nNews about the strike in Swidnik spread so quickly that within two weeks 50,000 people in the region were on strike. This wave of strikes was resolved on July 25, but the disruption was far from over: three weeks later the strikes at the Gdansk ship yards in northern Poland started, and within a year Solidarnosc had over 9 million members.\nIn the early days of the strikes, Poles had a hunger for news of the protests, of course, and despite the heavy censorship of official media they found them, through short-wave radio broadcasts from other countries.\nSo the lunch-room theory is not that different from the cute-cat theory, except that there\u0026rsquo;s no Internet. People gather wherever they gather for their everyday conversations and interactions, and it is in these everyday places that a spark of frustration can catch fire. And once it does catch fire, a combination of broadcast media and a networked public spreads the news quickly.\nPerhaps, the Polish example shows, the Internet is not essential for the spark to turn into a fire. Perhaps a digitally networked public is not the only networked public.\n4 Tunisia\u0026rsquo;s Second Act Even in Tunisia, politically sensitive material for which there is a high demand has found its way through dangerous pathways to reach a public desperate for news.\nIn a long piece called Streetbook (*) John Pollock interviews two members of an underground Tunisian group called Takriz [update: see Ethan Zuckerman and Jillian York\u0026rsquo;s comments below for reservations about Streetbook]. One of these \u0026ldquo;Taks\u0026rdquo; describes how the video that \u0026ldquo;made the second half of the [Tunisian] revolution\u0026rdquo; was taken when the regime had shut down the Internet, so \u0026ldquo;Takriz smuggled a CD of the video over the Algerian border\u0026rdquo; before forwarding it to Al Jazeera. YouTube may make it it easier and safer to make videos available (at least so long as Google lets it be done anonymously), but when an important video was available, the Internet was not essential to the process of distribution.\n5 Media Ecology or Network Ecology? If we are really going to talk about a \u0026ldquo;media ecology\u0026rdquo; in the sense EZ means, we need to include all those gathering places–online and offline–which are difficult to shut down precisely because of their everyday, general purpose role. In addition to Facebook and YouTube we need to include factory lunchrooms, mosques and churches, football stadia (*), universities, popular music (*), balconies (*), and more.\nAll these share a number of properties with Cute Cats sites. They are difficult to shut down without annoying large numbers of previously quiescent people, they are difficult to monitor in detail because of the dispersed and varied nature of the interactions that go on, and they are already familiar places for the gathering and sharing of information. EZ says that \u0026ldquo;we don\u0026rsquo;t take these \u0026lsquo;cute cat tools\u0026rsquo; seriously enough. These tools that anyone can use, that are used 99% of the time for completely banal purposes\u0026rdquo; but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t take offline everyday institutions for banal sharing seriously enough.\nEZ\u0026rsquo;s mistake is the achilles heel of social media advocates. Talk of a \u0026ldquo;networked society\u0026rdquo; is justified by comparing today\u0026rsquo;s digitally connected populations to a population of couch potatoes watching prime time TV, but such a comparison overlooks all those other institutions of public networking. Instead of talking of a \u0026ldquo;media ecology\u0026rdquo; we should be talking of a \u0026ldquo;network ecology\u0026rdquo;: the intricate tapestry of multiple networking institutions and practices that makes up a society.\nDo digital social media supplement other networking instutions or displace them? There has been a lot of work on this at the individual level, but it\u0026rsquo;s much more difficult to evaluate on a societal level. It is possible that digital social media increase the richness of social networks in a society, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible (likely?) that digital social media are the kudzu of networks, thriving while they strangle the other components of a rich and diverse network ecology; the best network left standing in an impoverished environment.\nFootnotes 1 Among other things, Sami ben Gharbia is author of a fantastic essay on The Internet Freedom Fallacy and Arab Digital Activism (*)\n2 In fact it may not have been so much that the site was difficult to censor, as that Malaysian government had decided to exclude the Internet as a whole from its otherwise-strict censorship rules (*).\nDate: 2012-01-05 22:50:21 EST\nOrg version 7.6 with Emacs version 23\n","date":1325804172,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"caed5bad16c48feada560b7fb573b8c1","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/ethan-zuckermans-cute-cats-and-the-arab-spring/","publishdate":"2012-01-05T22:56:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/ethan-zuckermans-cute-cats-and-the-arab-spring/","section":"post","summary":"Table of Contents  1 Dry Tunisian Tinder\n 2 Cute Cats and Malaysian Opposition\n 3 Polish lunch rooms\n 4 Tunisia\u0026rsquo;s Second Act\n 5 Media Ecology or Network Ecology?\n  Cory Doctorow (*) and Jillian York (*) were both full of praise for Ethan Zuckerman\u0026rsquo;s Vancouver Human Rights Lecture on Cute Cats and the Arab Spring (*), so I listened to the podcast from CBC\u0026rsquo;s Ideas (*).","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tEthan Zuckerman's \"Cute Cats and the Arab Spring\"\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents  Avoiding Cynicism (As If)\n Facebook: Privacy Hits the Mainstream\n Amazon: Abusing Community\n Apple: Stepping in Front of Google\n  Avoiding Cynicism (As If) Peering into the New Year, my better half Lynne reflected yesterday that it is a duty of each of us, as we grow older, to be vigilant against encroaching cynicism. She\u0026rsquo;s right (of course!), and I do feel that strong and steady current tugging me sluggishly downstream towards the lazy, easy waters of geezerhood, to a place where everything new shows itself only by its flaws and in which every new glass is basically empty.\nLuckily, 2012 looks like being a banner year for those of us who take a critical view of the hype and commercialization around digital technology, so I\u0026rsquo;m actually feeling quite cheery. The number of digital hecklers is growing1, and will continue to do so as the relations between the mainstream Internet and its audience/members sours. A growing wave of disenchantment is gathering enough steam [sic] to become a creative force in its own right, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s going to be fascinating to watch, as well as potentially a period of renewal for alternative culture.\nSo Happy New Year, and here are a few predictions for 2012. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the full impact of any will be over and done during the calendar year, but I do think we\u0026rsquo;ll look back at 2012 as a turning point in attitudes to digital technologies.\nFacebook: Privacy Hits the Mainstream Prediction High-profile privacy cases in 2012 will dramatically accelerate the level of public distrust in Facebook, which will spill over to other Internet aggregators.\nPrivacy has always been the other side of the openness coin. Everyone loves openness, of course, but the last year or two has made it clear that behind Mark Zuckerberg\u0026rsquo;s Facebook profile (*) claim that \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m trying to make the world a more open place\u0026rdquo; there is a hard, cold, commercial reality. Are we sharing among each other, or are we feeding Facebook? And where is the boundary between the two?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a dilemma my son faces, which also confronts many other young people. After university one potential employer is the Canadian government. If he clicks his support on Facebook for political protests, will government background checks have access to this information and will it count against him? There\u0026rsquo;s no point asking Facebook even if you did trust it, because today\u0026rsquo;s terms and conditions may change, and the laws governing it may change too. From being an open space where it is easy to express our political views, Facebook is becoming a panopticon where we censor ourselves, not knowing who is watching.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not clear that the advertising driven model of web technology is sustainable given its dependence on data that we are increasingly reluctant to give up. As ex-Facebook engineer Jeff Hammerbacher says, \u0026ldquo;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;That sucks.\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;ve lived with this downside until now but as the choices become more stark this may change, and when things change on the Internet, they can change very quickly. danah boyd\u0026rsquo;s view that \u0026ldquo;Facebook is a utility; utilities get regulated\u0026rdquo; (*) will become mainstream. We\u0026rsquo;ll see demands2 for changes to Facebook\u0026rsquo;s practices (see the Europe vs Facebook group (*), and the Irish data protection commissioner\u0026rsquo;s report here) gaining momentum.\nAmazon: Abusing Community Prediction Change in the open source world as Google takes on Amazon.\nAmazon is rapidly making a name for itself as the company to give the Internet a bad name. From brutal working conditions (*) to treating physical bookstores as showrooms (*) to union-bashing (*) to McCarthyist policies around Wikileaks (*) to tax opposition (*) to screwing libraries (*), this company has done everything it can to demolish the image of the Internet as a source of cooperation, collaboration, and open friendship. It has perfected the act of free-riding on open source efforts, building its (remarkable, it must be said) profitable EC2 infrastructure on Xen Hypervisor, using Linux extensively, and not contributing back (*), in the same way it happily takes all those volunteer hours put into Wikipedia and uses them to sell its own devices, messing with authors\u0026rsquo; rights as it does so (*).\nThe Kindle Fire is the icing on the cake: Amazon has taken the Android operating system and its Linux kernel and used it to power the Amazon tablet. In doing so, it has taken Google\u0026rsquo;s language of openness around Android (always suspect) and thrown it right back in Google\u0026rsquo;s face, removing the Google applications and most evidence that the device is running Android, and making it an Amazon device from end to end.\nWith the Kindle Fire looking likely to become the top selling Android tablet, you have to wonder how long Google will welcome this state of affairs. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of talk about the rivalry between Google and Apple, but the tension between Google and Amazon is the conflict that may change the open source world. The licensing terms for open source software have been increasingly friendly to commercial exploitation of community projects, moving steadily away from the more restrictive GPL (*), and Amazon\u0026rsquo;s nose-thumbing may be the step that forces a re-evaluation of this enterprise-friendly stance.\nApple: Stepping in Front of Google Prediction As the open web fragments, Google will look to its bottom line.\nSpeaking of Google, Apple\u0026rsquo;s voice control system Siri may be the biggest threat the friendly ad-broker has yet faced, and you could argure that Siri is the major threat to the openness of the web.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s increasingly obvious that the web has several natural bottlenecks, and that these bottlenecks are simultaneously the places where money can be made and chokepoints where political pressure can be applied. Ever since broadband and mobile access replaced ye olde dialup and Internet access became dominated by telcos and cable companies, ISPs have been one set of bottlenecks. Mobile device makers are another. The DNS system itself is yet another, which SOPA is looking to squeeze. Finally, there is aggregation, Silicon Valley\u0026rsquo;s preferred source of influence.\nAggregation creates a single point of entry into a part of the web, whether it\u0026rsquo;s aggregating consumer items (Amazon), digital products (Apple), people (Facebook), or the web itself (Google), and aggregation is driven by increasing returns to scale. The point of aggregators is to stand between us and what we want to reach, guiding us to those parts of it that seem best.\nThe thing about Siri is that it stands in front of Google, potentially displacing the search box as iPhone users\u0026rsquo; point of entry to the web. Just as removal from Google\u0026rsquo;s search engine makes you vanish from the web, so Siri has the potential to make Google vanish. Well, not vanish in the short term, but fade at least. Apple negotiates deals with providers like Yelp and Wolfram Alpha, doing an end run around the PageRank algorithm.\nIf Siri and other voice-recognition \u0026ldquo;assistants\u0026rdquo; move towards the mainstream, we can expect to experience an increasingly curated/censored version of the web (*). The relationship between Apple and the anti-establishment has always been love-hate, and Siri may drive it into hate-hate.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s friendly image can last only so long as its growth rate and profit margins stay healthy. It\u0026rsquo;s already lost the aura of being the place to be for programmers, soon we\u0026rsquo;ll soon see enough competition to force Google into a more orthodox stance, and that will shock a lot of observers.\nFootnotes: 1 A few years ago Andrew Keen\u0026rsquo;s silly \u0026ldquo;Cult of the Amateur\u0026rdquo; was the most prominent digital criticism book.

Jeff Jarvis has become wealthy from this new ethic of sharing \u0026ndash; he is fond of \u0026ldquo;starting conversations\u0026rdquo; which he can then take ownership of \u0026ndash; but when it comes to giving credit to those who come before, for example by referencing previous writers on the topics he addresses, well it just seems like it\u0026rsquo;s too much work for him. The book is one long argument by assertion, unsupported by facts and liberally sprinkled with utterances like \u0026ldquo;small is the new big\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;We have shifted from an economy based on scarcity to one based on abundance\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Google has built its empire on trusting us\u0026rdquo;.\nIt looks like his new book, Public Parts, is more of the same. The New Republic just published a long review of the book by Evgeny Morozovhere or here. It\u0026rsquo;s forthright, opinionated, angry, entertaining and also makes some damning arguments against the book.\nJeff Jarvis responds to the review here in bizarre fashion. He first raises the prospect of personal prejudice (\u0026ldquo;Morozov reliably dislikes me, just as he dislikes people I quote\u0026rdquo;) and then dismisses the review as \u0026ldquo;he writes only a personal attack\u0026rdquo;. Morozov spends 800 words critiquing Jarvis\u0026rsquo;s misunderstanding of ideas about the public sphere and his oversimplification of Habermas, which Jarvis distorts and reduces to a complaint \u0026ldquo;about the names Habermas and Oprah appearing in the same book\u0026rdquo;. Morozov spends 600 words on Public Parts\u0026rsquo; culturally narrow ideas about Germany, Finland, and the strange attitudes of non-Americans to privacy, which Jarvis encapsulates as \u0026ldquo;[Morozov] finds Streetview to be a case of Germans \u0026lsquo;tyrannized by an American company\u0026rsquo;\u0026ldquo;. In short, Jarvis exaggerates and distorts the arguments before dismissing them.\nTo anyone who reads carefully, the argument is over and Morozov wins, but unfortunately that\u0026rsquo;s not the end of the story. Much of Morozov\u0026rsquo;s frustration comes from Jarvis\u0026rsquo;s refusal to engage with the world of facts. He stays safely in the world of pronouncement (\u0026ldquo;Publicness is a sign of our empowerment\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;the crowd owns the wisdom of the crowd\u0026rdquo; and so on). Jarvis is skilled at the marketing of ideas: if you Google [publicness], four of the first page listings are about or by Jarvis, and this canny use of branding will keep his profile high, well beyond the reach of factual criticism. Jarvis knows his audience and what they want to hear, and what they want is a self-help message for businesses: the world is changing, everything you thought you knew is irrelevant, and I have the key to the future.\nSo what, then, is the point of the hours Morozov spent writing a 7,000 word review if he won\u0026rsquo;t reach Jarvis\u0026rsquo;s core constituency? There are two other audiences that such pieces can reach. One is to shore up those who broadly agree with Morozov\u0026rsquo;s perspective (yes, like me) that there is an ulterior motive, a very familiar and old-fashioned one, behind this talk of sharing and publicness. We cannot read every new book, watch every new TED talk, attend every conference and yet we do need to stay current and stay informed. I am not going to read Public Parts because there are so many other things to read, but I cannot afford to be completely ignorant of it. Morozov\u0026rsquo;s review does the job for me.\nThe second is more important. Many people are attracted by the romantic rhetoric of openness, sharing, and the end of existing institutions, but not all have yet sorted out the political consequences of a commitment to these virtues. There are still people on the fence - and it\u0026rsquo;s important for these people to know that, no matter what progressive-sounding language is used, some of the most idealistic arguments for sharing are made by those who will mine the data you provide in order to build fortunes from advertising. To shape that debate and to keep a political space open for an Internet that does not simply follow the venture-capitalist idea of progress, we need fact based arguments, so kudos to Morozov for doing the necessary work in this case.\n","date":1318777662,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"793a2dd998a6d4710a0e692b20985b0e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/morozov-vs-jarvis/","publishdate":"2011-10-16T15:07:42Z","relpermalink":"/post/morozov-vs-jarvis/","section":"post","summary":"Jeff Jarvis\u0026rsquo;s 2009 book _What Would Google Do? _is a breathless paean to the benefits of sharing, linking, and being open, but it has not a single reference or footnote, and no bibliography.

A little later he retweeted a response that \u0026ldquo;apparently 87% of US residents can be uniquely identified by zip+DOB+gender: bit.ly/qysMqs\u0026rdquo; and later followed up with \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s a reference for the claim that zip code, gender and DOB uniquely identify 87% of individuals: http://www.citeulike.org/user/burd/article/5822736 via @crdant\u0026rdquo;.\nThese tweets are odd and disturbing. The zip/DOB/gender finding is a basic one in studies of privacy, published years ago by Latanya Sweeney of Carnegie Mellon University. I gave a talk at work on privacy a year ago, and this was one of the first references I came across. Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly has been pushing an agenda of Open Data, particularly Open Government Data, for the last couple of years, and yet it looks as if he isn\u0026rsquo;t aware of the basic privacy issues around such data. Can that really be the case?\nIf it is, then here, to help Tim along, are some notes from my talk as a kind of introduction to data privacy, or at least to data-anonymization and re-identification. A great resource on some of these issues from a legal perspective is Paul Ohm\u0026rsquo;s 2009 paper \u0026ldquo;Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failures of Anonymization\u0026rdquo; (PDF), University of Colorado Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 09-12. It\u0026rsquo;s long, but it\u0026rsquo;s so well written it\u0026rsquo;s an easy read. Much of these notes originated with this paper, in one form or another.\nHow Privacy Broke Crowdsourcing A few years ago Netflix ran its highly successful and widely publicised crowdsourced prize competition, in which it released a data set of users and their movie ratings and let competitors download them and search for patterns. The data consisted of a customer ID (faked), a movie, the customer\u0026rsquo;s rating of the movie, and the date of the rating.\nIn the FAQ for the competition, Netflix said this:\nQ. Is there any customer information in the dataset that should be kept private?\nA. No, all customer identifying information has been removed; all that remains are ratings and dates. This follows our privacy policy… Even if, for example, you knew all your own ratings and their dates you probably couldn\u0026rsquo;t identify them reliably in the data because only a small sample was included (less than one tenth of our complete dataset) and that data was subject to perturbation.\nThis certainly looked reasonable enough, but Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov of the University of Texas had other ideas.1 First, they looked at the claim that the data was perturbed by asking acquaintances for their rankings. They found that only a small number of the ratings were perturbed at all, which makes sense because perturbing the data gets in the way of its usefulness.\nIn the Netflix data set, different users have distinct sets of movies that they have watched. The data set is sparse (most people have not seen most movies), and there are many different movies available, so individual tastes and viewing histories leave a clear fingerprint. That is, if you knew what movies someone watched, you could pick them out of the data set because no one else would have seen the same combination.\nA closer look showed that with 8 ratings (of which 2 may be completely wrong) and dates that may have a 14-day error, 99% of the records in the Netflix data set uniquely identify an individual. For 68% of records, two ratings and dates are sufficient. Various combinations of information are sufficient to identify users, eg 84% by 6 of 8 movies outside the top 500.\nBut of course there is no personally identifiable information in the data set. So is this a privacy issue? It is when you have another data set to look at. The researchers took a sample of 50 IMDB users. The IMDB data is noisy - there is no ranking, for example. Still, they identified two users whose Netflix records were 28 and 15 standard deviations away from the next best. One from ratings, another from dates.\nSo despite Netflix\u0026rsquo;s best efforts, the data set included enough information to identify some individuals. Partly because of this, a planned follow-up competition was scrapped, and the whole enterprise of crowdsourcing recommender algorithms was given a possibly terminal blow.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s this all about? Just to be clear, this set of notes is not about the following things:\n Encryption\n Restricting access to data\n Lost USB keys and CDs\n  It is about these:\n Deliberately released data that turns out to infringe on privacy\n HIPAA, EU Data Directive, corporate rules for handling customer data\n Advertising and ISPs\n Gov 2.0, data.gov, and \u0026ldquo;openness\u0026rdquo;\n  It\u0026rsquo;s about claims such as: \u0026ldquo;Attorneys on Monday accused Google of intentionally divulging millions of users\u0026rsquo; search queries to third parties in violation of federal law and its own terms of service\u0026rdquo; (October 26 2010)\n\u0026ldquo;MySpace and some popular applications on the social-networking site have been transmitting data to outside advertising companies that could be used to identify users, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found\u0026rdquo; (October 23, 2010)\n\u0026ldquo;Facebook users may inadvertently reveal their sexual preference to advertisers in an apparent wrinkle in the social-networking site\u0026rsquo;s advertising system, researchers have found\u0026rdquo; (October 22, 2010)\n(These claims are a year old, found in the week before I gave the talk. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are many more.) The Facebook case was one in which advertisers (for a nursing program I believe) asked to target their ads specifically at females and at men interested in other men. But unlike, for example, an ad about a gay bar where the target demographic is blatantly obvious, a male user reading the ad text would have no idea that it had been targeted solely at a very specific demographic, and that by clicking it he would reveal to the advertiser both his sexual preference and a unique identifier (cookie, IP address, or e-mail address if he signs up on the advertiser\u0026rsquo;s site). \u0026ldquo;Furthermore (the researchers wrote) such deceptive ads are not uncommon; indeed exactly half of the 66 ads shown exclusively to gay men (more than 50 times) during our experiment did not mention \u0026lsquo;gay\u0026rsquo; anywhere in the ad text.\u0026rdquo;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t we have laws to deal with this? Indeed we do. Europe and the USA adopt different approaches to balancing privacy and utility, with the US adopting industry-specific rules (HIPAA for health, FERPA for education, Driver\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Protection Act, FDA regulations, Video Privacy Protection Act etc), while the EU has taken a global approach with the Data Protection Directive. But both approaches are based on a common set of concepts and assumptions.\nThe big thing is that there is an assumption that data can be anonymized, and once it is then you can share it, because where\u0026rsquo;s the harm? Both sets of rules are built on the idea that there is such a thing as personally identifiable information (PII) and that you can hide it, while still releasing data that is useful. The release process is \u0026ldquo;release and forget\u0026rdquo; because if data is properly anonymized why do you have to track what\u0026rsquo;s done with it? There is a faith in the anonymization process, and that faith was broken by the Netflix study and a couple of other related studies.\nLatanya Sweeney and the Massachusetts Governor Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to a time before HIPAA, when the debate was focused in terms of how much anonymization you needed to do. Here are some quotations from Latanya Sweeney\u0026rsquo;s paper (PDF), that Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly appeared unaware of.\n\u0026ldquo;Figure 1\u0026rdquo; below is a simple Venn diagram with two intersecting circles. The left circle holds medical data: Ethnicity, Visit Date, Diagnosis, Procedure, Medication, Total Charge. The right circle holds a voter list: Name, Address, Date Registered, Party Affiliation, Date Last Voted. And in the intersection is ZIP, Date of Birth, Sex.\n   The National Association of Health Data Organizations (NAHDO) reported that 37 states in the USA have legislative mandates to collect hospital level data and that 17 states have started collecting ambulatory care data from hospitals, physicians offices, clinics, and so forth. The leftmost circle in Figure 1 contains a subset of the fields of information, or attributes, that NAHDO recommends these states collect; these attributes include the patient's ZIP code, birth date, gender, and ethnicity.     In Massachusetts, the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) is responsible for purchasing health insurance for state employees. GIC collected patient-specific data with nearly one hundred attributes per encounter along the lines of the those shown in the leftmost circle of Figure 1 for approximately 135,000 state employees and their families. Because the data were believed to be anonymous, GIC gave a copy of the data to researchers and sold a copy to industry.     For twenty dollars I purchased the voter registration list for Cambridge Massachusetts and received the information on two diskettes. The rightmost circle in Figure 1 shows that these data included the name, address, ZIP code, birth date, and gender of each voter. This information can be linked using ZIP code, birth date and gender to the medical information, thereby linking diagnosis, procedures and medications to particularly named individuals.     For example, William Weld was governor of Massachusetts at that time and his medical records were in the GIC data. Governor Weld lived in Cambridge Massachusetts. According to the Cambridge Voter list, six people had his particular birth date; only three of them were men; and, he was the only one in his 5-digit ZIP code. [Editor's note: a 5-digit zip code may have several thousand people in it.]     The example above provides a demonstration of re-identification by directly linking (or \"matching\") on shared attributes. The work presented in this paper shows that altering the released information to map to many possible people, thereby making the linking ambiguous, can thwart this kind of attack. The greater the number of candidates provided, the more ambiguous the linking, and therefore, the more anonymous the data.    In a theatrical flourish, Dr. Sweeney sent the Governor\u0026rsquo;s health records (which included diagnoses and prescriptions) to his office.\nNow, of course, health information in the US is governed by HIPAA, but according to HIPAA, \u0026ldquo;de-identified\u0026rdquo; health information is unregulated. De-identified means either: a statistician says it is de-identified, or the 18 Personally Identifying Information (PII) identifiers are suppressed or generalized. These PIIs are things like Name, e-mail address, social security numbers, computer IP addresses, and so on.\nThe EU doesn\u0026rsquo;t list specifics. Instead it says that PII is \u0026ldquo;anything that can be used to identify you\u0026rdquo;. But what does that cover? IP addresses perhaps? Here is Google in their argument to the EU:\n we \u0026ldquo;are strong supporters of the idea that data protection laws should apply to any data that could identify you. The reality is though that in most cases, an IP address without additional information cannot.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;We believe anonymizing IP addresses after 9 months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months strikes the right balance.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;we delete the last octet after nine months (170.123.456.XXX)\u0026rdquo;\n  The Latanya Sweeney result was the first to show that once you can mix and match data sets, PII is just not enough to provide privacy. And nowadays, of course, data mining multiple data sets is big business.\nHow Do You Anonymize Data? k-anonymity Let\u0026rsquo;s step back a little and look at the technical side of anonymization. There are four basic methods for anonymizing data:\nReplacement - substitute identifying numbers Suppression - omit from the released data Generalization - for example, replace birth date with something less specific, like year of birth Perturbation - make random changes to the data\nThen you have to measure how private a data set. Latanya Sweeney came up with the notion of k-anonymity to define this. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works.\nThink about a table, with rows and attributes. Each attributes is either part of a quasi-identifier (like a name or address), or is sensitive information (like the fact you had an operation on a particular afternoon). A quasi-identifier is a set of attributes that, perhaps in combination, can uniquely identify individuals. Sensitive information includes the attributes that we want to keep private. Your driving license number is an identifier; our driving record is sensitive information. The table satisfies k-anonymity iff each sequence of values in any quasi-identifier appears with at least k occurrences. Bigger k is better.\nSo here is a table with 11 rows.\nNameRaceBirthGenderZipProblem  Sean  Black  1965-09-20  M  02141  Short breath   Daniel  Black  1965-02-14  M  02141  Chest pain   Kate  Black  1965-10-23  F  02138  Hypertension   Marion  Black  1965-08-24  F  02138  Hypertension   Helen  Black  1964-07-11  F  02138  Obesity   Reese  Black  1964-01-12  F  02138  Chest Pain   Forest  White  1964-10-23  M  02138  Chest Pain   Hilary  White  1964-03-15  F  02139  Obesity   Philip  White  1964-08-13  M  02139  Short breath   Jamie  White  1967-05-05  M  02139  Chest pain   Sean  White  1967-03-21  M  02138  Chest pain     If we remove all the attributes except for the problem we have a very anonymized data set (k = 11):\nNameRaceBirthGenderZipProblem       Short breath        Chest pain        Hypertension        Hypertension        Obesity        Chest Pain        Chest Pain        Obesity        Short breath        Chest pain        Chest pain     On the other hand, if we just remove the name and generalize the zip code and date of birth we have a less anonymized set. Exercise: convince yourself that k=2 for this set.\nNameRaceBirthGenderZipProblem   Black  1965  M  0214*  Short breath    Black  1965  M  0214*  Chest pain    Black  1965  F  0213*  Hypertension    Black  1965  F  0213*  Hypertension    Black  1964  F  0213*  Obesity    Black  1964  F  0213*  Chest Pain    White  1964  M  0213*  Chest Pain    White  1964  F  0213*  Obesity    White  1964  M  0213*  Short breath    White  1967  M  0213*  Chest pain    White  1967  M  0213*  Chest pain     Of course, the issue is utility. There is a tradeoff between keeping the data useful for research and maintaining privacy. Researchers and attackers are doing the same thing after all: looking for useful patterns in the data. With the k=2 data set you can ask questions about correlation of problems with gender, or with geography to some extent (although not very specific geographical factors, like toxic leaks).\nIt would be nice if you could make the data set anonymous for the purposes of attackers, but still useful for researchers. But it turns out you can\u0026rsquo;t. In a paper called The Cost of Privacy: Destruction of Data-Mining Utility in Anonymized Data Publishing, Justin Brickell and Vitaly Shmatikov investigated the problem. They took a set of different sanitization methods and compared it to a data set with trivial sanitization (removal of identifiers). Here are the results.\n\nThe left bar of each pair is the privacy (smaller = more private), The right represent the utility to the researcher (bigger = more useful). Anonymization seeks to shorten left without shortening the right, but the results show, depressingly, that small increases in privacy cause large decreases in utility.\nPlease could you tell me about the Database of Ruin? OK, if you insist.\nIf we are going to take a new look, we need to recognize that privacy is not a binary issue, and it is not a property of a single data set. We need to worry about reidentification attacks that do not reveal sensitive information. As Paul Ohm writes: \u0026ldquo;For every person on earth, there is at least one fact about them stored in a computer database that an adversary could use to blackmail, discriminate against, harass, or steal the identity of him or her… the \u0026lsquo;database of ruin\u0026rsquo; containing this fact but now splintered across dozens of databases on computers around the world.\u0026rdquo;\nPrivacy is erased incrementally as successive queries reduce uncertainty and narrow in on an individual. The way to quantify this reduction in uncertainty is to use the idea of information entropy, adopted from the thermodynamic concept, and usually identified by H. The information gained in a query is\nH(before) - H(after)\nas you increase your knowledge of a system, the entropy (loosely, disorder) decreases.\nSo what is the formula for H?\nFor a set of outcomes {i,…}, each with probability pi, the information entropy is:\nH = - SUM pi log2(pi)\n(excuse the lack of greek sigma), and is measured in bits. The logarithm appears because the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of the probabilities of each event, but the information we gain from observing two independent events is the sum of the information we gain from each event\nTake a simple example: a coin toss. Before the toss, there are two outcomes with equal probabilities, so\nH = -(1\u0026frasl;2) log2(1\u0026frasl;2) - (1\u0026frasl;2)log2(1\u0026frasl;2)\n= - log2(1\u0026frasl;2)\n= log2(2)\n= 1 bits\nwhich makes sense if you think about it, because the coin could be heads (1) or tails (0).\nAfter the toss, H = log2(1) = 0 : there is no uncertainty left and we have complete information about the system.\nIn the same way, a dice roll has (before rolling it) an entropy of\nH = log2(6) ~ 2.6 bits\nSo if the challenge is to identify one person in the population of the world, how much information entropy is there? The identity of a random, unknown person is just under 33 bits (233 ~ 8 billion). Hence the web site 33bits.org.\nLearning a fact about the individual reduces the uncertainty (reduces information entropy). So if you learn that the star sign is Capricorn then that\u0026rsquo;s -log2(1\u0026frasl;12) = log2(12) = 3.58 bits of information.\nIf you find out other independent pieces of information you add up the contributions to find out how much the the entropy has been reduced. So a ZIP code may provide 23.81 bits of information, a birthday 8.51, and gender 1 bit for a total of 33.32 bits: it probably identifies one individual.\nThe Netflix de-anonymization paper used these ideas a bit. The a priori entropy of the data set (additional information required for complete de-anonymization) is 19 bits (219 = 524288, which is about the number of individuals in the data set). Individual movies give from 1 to 18 bits of information, depending on what you know about them (dates within 14 days, rankings +/- 1). Very popular movies gave little information, but niche movies viewed by few individuals yielded many bits of information. So little auxiliary information is needed to re-identify records in the database. In a theoretical excursion, the researchers showed that de-anonymization is going to be robust against noise, and does not need much additional information, so long as the data set is large and sparse enough.\nSo what now? I can do nothing better than quote from Paul Ohm to summarize the privacy dilemma we find ourselves in.\n\u0026ldquo;Abandoning PII is a disruptive and necessary first step, but it is not enough alone to restore the balance between privacy and utility that we once enjoyed. How do we fix the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of laws and regulations that we once believed reflected a finely calibrated balance but in reality rested on a fundamental misunderstanding of science?\nTechniques that eschew release-and-forget may improve over time, but because of inherent limitations like those described above, they will never supply a silver bullet alternative. Technology cannot save the day, and regulation must play a role.\nOhm notes that the US sectoral approach to regulation sets the privacy bar too low, by focusing on explicitly listed PII. Meanwhile the EU, by saying \u0026ldquo;anything that can be used to identify you\u0026rdquo; would, if interpreted in the light of modern de-anonymization techniques, be too high.\nThe direction to take, says Ohm, is to focus on the people, not the anonymization, and to distinguish private from public release. We need to codify notions of trust and practices and apply strong sanctions against re-identification. This will put more administrative and procedural burdens in our future, but is needed to preserve privacy.\nAnd, to return to Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly\u0026rsquo;s tweet, open data advocates and big data enthusiasts need to pay more attention to these issues rather than relying, as some do, on personally identifying information as a sufficient solution.\nFootnotes: 1 Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets, IEEE Symposiom on Security and Privacy, 2008.

I tried a few things, threw them away. Tried a few more, scrunched them up into balls of electrons, and dragged them to the little waste bin up there in the corner of the screen. Life was looking grim (although not as grim as the awesomely atmospheric trailer for the Andrea Arnold version of Wuthering Heights, shot in wonderful Swaledale, and coming soon to a theatre near me, I hope).\nBut then two research papers about Twitter and the Arab Spring appeared within days of each other. Could these be raw material for a little grumbling about Internet-centrism, I thought? Well knock me sideways, it turns out they could.\nFirst up is Opening Closed Regimes, by Philip N. Howard and others, a report from the Project on Information Technology and Political Islam at the University of Washington. \u0026ldquo;What was the role of social media during the Arab Spring?\u0026rdquo; it asks, and it answers the question with ne\u0026rsquo;er a duelling anecdote in sight, which you would think would be a good thing.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not. The paper is resolutely and exclusively like the drunk looking under the lamp post to find his keys, because that\u0026rsquo;s where the light is brightest. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of data about what happens on Twitter because the Twitter API provides access to large numbers of tweets together with all their metadata, and then you can slice and dice them to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content. And that\u0026rsquo;s what these researchers have done. I know from personal experience how tempting it is to think there\u0026rsquo;s gold in them thar queries, that if you interrogate the data in just the right way you\u0026rsquo;ll find the key to unlock the box and find enlightenment, or at least an unmixed metaphor.\nNot that there\u0026rsquo;s anything wrong with data mining Twitter. But if it\u0026rsquo;s the only data source you use, you really can\u0026rsquo;t use it to make broader statements. And the paper does make broad claims, like \u0026ldquo;Social media played a central role in shaping political debates in the Arab Spring\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Twitter seems to have been a key tool in the region for raising expectations of success and coordinating strategy. Twitter also seems to have been the key media for spreading immediate news about big political changes from country to country in the region.\u0026rdquo; These are statements that reach out from Twitter to the broader social context of which it is a part, but if Twitter is literally the only medium you look at, then obviously it is likely to appear \u0026ldquo;central\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;a key tool\u0026rdquo;. A section titled \u0026ldquo;Social Media\u0026rsquo;s Centrality to Political Conversation\u0026rdquo; analyzes the volume of online content during the time leading up to the uprisings, and looks at how the web sites of political actors linked to social networking and other news services. There\u0026rsquo;s nowt but digital content. What the section is really looking at is social media\u0026rsquo;s centrality to online political content.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no mention here of other ways in which individuals actually exchanged information, whether in university campuses, on the football terraces, in mosques, through professional networks of lawyers and teachers, via posters or leaflets, or around kitchen tables. All this teeming activity is simply invisible, out there in the obscure unilluminated and unexamined darkness. Out of sight, out of mind.\nOpening Closed Regimes reminds us that comparisons are essential. Mapping social media interactions, or online linkage patterns, no matter how ingeniously, is never going to tell us anything about how online behaviour fits into the broader social world. And it\u0026rsquo;s never going to justify conclusions like \u0026ldquo;During the Arab Spring, individuals demonstrated their desire for freedom through social media, and social media became a critical part of the toolkit used to achieve that freedom.\u0026rdquo;\nBut Opening Closed Regimes is better than the other paper, The Revolutions Were Tweeted: Information Flows During the 2011 Tunisian and Egyptian Revolutions (pdf) by Gilad Lotan and others including (to my dismay) danah boyd, whose writings I usually really learn from - like Six Provocations for Big Data, for example.\nThis paper also takes Twitter feed data - nothing else at all: nada, zilch, zero - slices, dices, etc etc as before, and then says \u0026ldquo;we discuss how Twitter plays a key role in amplifying and spreading timely information across the globe\u0026rdquo;.\nThe paper is published in the International Journal of Communication, which you\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to know \u0026ldquo;adheres to the highest standards of peer review and engages established and emerging scholars from anywhere in the world\u0026rdquo;. So I was a little surprised when I looked up lead author Gilad Lotan, who lists his organizational affiliation as Social Flow.\n[**Update: **the authors now provide an appendix to the paper explaining the relationship between the company, the lead author, and the work. I accept that explanation. I leave the post here, but please read it in that light.]\nWhy? Because it turns out that Social Flow is a private company that \u0026ldquo;has developed the industry\u0026rsquo;s first and only social media optimization technology that uses real-time data – including the Twitter and bitly firehoses – to help publishers, retailers, and brands earn maximum potential engagement on Twitter.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s right, it\u0026rsquo;s basically SEO for Twitter. It develops algorithms that \u0026ldquo;dynamically publishes the best message at the best time to ensure its clients get the maximum amount of engagement from their Followers.\u0026rdquo; Yup, these people are going to pollute your Twitter feed, and make money from it. Small wonder that the paper paints such a positive picture of Twitter\u0026rsquo;s influence.\nSocial Flow is a venture capital funded company based in New York. According to CrunchBase, they recently received $7M in Series A funding from a variety of venture capitalists including \u0026ldquo;Softbank, with Softbank NY, RRE Ventures, Betaworks, High Line Venture Partners, AOL Ventures, SV Angel and some individual angels investing.\u0026rdquo; Plus, they have a lovey-dovey relationsihp with Twitter itself. TechCrunch comments that:\n   Neither side would comments on the terms of the relationship — but it's clearly beneficial to both.     \"This is exactly what we want to see out of the ecosystem,\" Twitter Platform lead Ryan Sarver adds. \"These guys are building a real business,\"    Thanks Ryan.\nAnd just in case you wondered: their investor Betaworks has also invested in Tweetdeck and Summize: other companies that have actually been bought by Twitter.\nThere is no mention of this blatant conflict of interest, which took me all of 30 minutes to look up, in the paper. The \u0026ldquo;International Journal of Communication\u0026rdquo; should be ashamed for publishing it.\nAfter that, it\u0026rsquo;s hardly worth even reading the paper. But I did. It suffers from some of the usual Internet-centric fallacies.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the VERY FIRST SENTENCE (capital letters in tribute to Tiger Beatdown\u0026rsquo;s third birthday): \u0026ldquo;The shift from an era of broadcast mass media to one of networked digital media has altered both information flows and the nature of news worked.\u0026rdquo; Apparently positioning Internet sources as a competitor to broadcast media is so obviously true that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need support. Except that it\u0026rsquo;s far from obvious that there is such a shift, even in North America, with audiences consuming just as much television as they ever have, with social media being an increasingly important _complement _to TV. And of course in North Africa the spread of television is much more recent - the growth of Al Jazeera even more so - so that there has almost certainly been no such shift at all.\nThe conceptual background of the paper is rife with such assumptions of the way the digital and \u0026ldquo;mass media\u0026rdquo; world differ. Studies investigate \u0026ldquo;how news emerges from networked actors who span different professional and organization identities and contexts\u0026rdquo; – note the organic, bottom up word \u0026ldquo;emerges\u0026rdquo; – in contrast to the world of mainstream media, in which \u0026ldquo;journalists tend to produce news designed for their publishers and editors\u0026rdquo;, and enact \u0026ldquo;rituals of objectivity\u0026rdquo; to distance themselves from audiences. It\u0026rsquo;s a caricature of the Internet compared to a cartoon of non-digital media.\nAnd so it goes. The study itself is quite narrow, analysing information flows around Twitter, and makes cautious conclusions about the meaning of those information flows. But it acquires interest only from the suggestions, throughout, that this is part of a bigger picture of bottom-up newsmaking through social media. Their findings, for example, \u0026ldquo;confirm the notion that Twitter supports distributed conversation among participants and that journalism, in this era of social media, has become a conversation\u0026rdquo;.\nNow I don\u0026rsquo;t mind a critical look at mainstream media – there\u0026rsquo;s no shortage of things to criticize after all, and I suspect this is why well-intentioned people with anti-establishment agendas fall into the Internet-centricity trap. But even if \u0026ldquo;mass media\u0026rdquo; was nothing but a Debord-ian \u0026ldquo;society as spectacle\u0026rdquo; dystopia, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the venture-capital-driven world of social networks an alternative: social media companies are as mainstream, capitalist, and establishment as you can get. And they are no friends of liberation movements.\nSo, going back to the MIT Technology Review articles that I discussed last time, there are three contributions from people who are clearly on the left politically, and who seem to follow a broadly anti-establishment agenda, and whose writings I respect. But, if I can psycho-analyze from a distance, their writings show that they would dearly love Internet technology to be a natural ally of those who seek a more egalitarian, less hierarchical world. Unfortunately, wishes don\u0026rsquo;t always come true.\nAaron Bady argues that social media promotes, by its architecture, a notion of leaderlessness that is counter to the authoritarian nature of Egypt and other Arab states. Zeynep Tufekci sees Facebook\u0026rsquo;s features as \u0026ldquo;the ideal infrastructure to create the information/action cascade\u0026rdquo; that was the Arab Spring uprisings. Jillian York is more sceptical, but still looks for \u0026ldquo;the democratizing prospects of social media tools elsewhere: the strengthening of the public sphere… the transfer of the interaction from social networks to manifestation in the real world, on the street\u0026rdquo;. Reading these accounts, one cannot help but see three people who want to change the world for the better, and who are hoping that these new technological tools tip the balance of this continuing struggle in favour of the powerless, and against the powerful.\nBut their claims place technology ahead of issues of commerce and ownership, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s a mistake:\n Networks on Facebook may not have leaders, but Facebook itself is a centralized, commercialized system that has promoted its owners into positions of wealth (six billionaires) and power (access to heads of state, influence in Washington, a welcome at Davos). Is this an architecture of leaderlessness? Why would we spend intellectual and other effort arguing that this business is (even with caveats) a force for good in the world? Sure I use Facebook, but I also watch TV and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I trust the TV companies further than I could throw them.\n The wealth and power that Facebook and Google owners have accumulated depends directly on the commercial exploitation of the traffic through their sites. YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter will act as a \u0026ldquo;public sphere\u0026rdquo; only until the commercial interests of the site collide with the politics of the discussion. Once that boundary is crossed, these spaces become more Panopticon than public square. Is this an ideal infrastructure for activism?\n By focusing their hopes to a particular set of technologies that carry massive public data sets with them, it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible not to overestimate the role these technologies play in public discussion, as we saw with the two research papers. We track the conversations on Twitter during the revolution, but not the conversations among neighbours around kitchen tables. Out of sight, out of mind.\n  So, from those who seek to make money from commercializing our every social interaction, to those who mistakenly identify today\u0026rsquo;s mainstream Internet with the alternative ethos of a decade ago, there are plenty of people out there who are prone to see the world through the rose-tinted and digitally-enhanced glasses of Internet-centricity. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them right.\n","date":1316679022,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"3cd46823a95a7e7427e54f1d1e89abe9","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/earlier-today-i-thought-i-was-doomed-to-fail-that-part-3-of-this-prematurely-announced-trilogy-was-just-not-going-to-get-wr/","publishdate":"2011-09-22T08:10:22Z","relpermalink":"/post/earlier-today-i-thought-i-was-doomed-to-fail-that-part-3-of-this-prematurely-announced-trilogy-was-just-not-going-to-get-wr/","section":"post","summary":"[Time saver announcement: The most interesting thing in here is probably the conflict of interest in a recent Twitter-Arab Spring paper, which starts here.]\nEarlier today I thought I was doomed to fail; that part 3 of this prematurely-announced trilogy was just not going to get written.

Now back to the MIT Technology Review, and in particularJohn Pollock\u0026rsquo;s Streetbook, an extended set of interviews with two secretive Tunisian digital activists who go under the pseudonyms \u0026ldquo;Foetus\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Waterman\u0026rdquo;. The article describes how \u0026ldquo;their organization, Takriz, performed a remarkable and largely unknown role\u0026rdquo; in the uprisings.\nF—b— is such an important technology of mass coordination among young people that it was shut down in Egypt and other North African countries as the uprisings erupted in January 2011. F—b— was a technology that allowed many-to-many communication of political ideas, even under the censorious eye of repressive states; it provided a space where urban youth could gather to display their collective strength and build a clear identity separate from the state; it had fostered trans-national networks across the whole of North Africa; it lent itself to leaderless mass organization; and it produced some of the key organizing groups of the Tahrir Square protests. F—b— is, of course, Football.\nThe Ultras are groups of hard-core soccer fans who carry out dramatic displays of their fanaticism (fireworks, huge choreographed artworks, inventive songs) and who compete amongst each other to out-invent and out-display the fans of opposing teams. And, yes, fight with police from time to time. John Dorsey {blog} has followed Ultra culture closely. Here he is from Egypt in January 2011: {link}\n   With Egypt entering its second day of unprecedented anti-government protests, soccer fans constitute a well-organized and feared pillar of the marshalling grassroots coalition determined to ensure that President Hosni Mubarak suffers the same fate as Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who was toppled earlier this month by mass demonstrations.    Alaa Abd El Fattah, a prominent Egyptian blogger {Wikipedia article}, was widely quoted as saying \u0026ldquo;The ultras–the football fan associations–have played a more significant role than any political group on the ground at this moment.\u0026rdquo; {link}\nHere is Debbie Randle of BBC\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Newsbeat\u0026rdquo; {link}.\n   When Newsbeat spoke to some of the ultras, they told us large numbers of them fought on the front line at the protests.     They said they passed on their knowledge to other demonstrators and protected people and their homes.     Abdullah, who's a member of the Zamalek White Knight Ultras, told Newsbeat they also helped to organise the protests.     He said: \"We had many meetings to discuss the revolution before it started. We discussed that we must play an important part for Egypt, we must support Egypt.\"     The official line from the Ultras is that they didn't take part as a group but Newsbeat has been assured this isn't the case.     An ultra from a rival group, thought to have around 15,000 members, said they also played a role.     They worked alongside the White Knights, usually sworn enemies, to protest for their country.    A member of Egypt\u0026rsquo;s NDP was reported on January 26 2011 as acknowledging the importance of the Ultras: \u0026ldquo;what we saw on the streets yesterday are not just Muslim Brotherhood members or sympathisers but Egyptians at large; those are the Egyptians that you would see supporting the football national team– and their show of frustration was genuine and it had to be accommodated.\u0026rdquo; {link}\nAnd Sports Illustrated, on January 31 {link}:\n   Over the decades that have marked the tenure of Egypt's \"President for Life\" Hosni Mubarak, there has been one consistent nexus for anger, organization, and practical experience in the ancient art of street fighting: the country's soccer clubs. Over the past week, the most organized, militant fan clubs, also known as the \"ultras,\" have put those years of experience to ample use.    Why soccer? Let\u0026rsquo;s return to James Dorsey as quoted in Sports Illustrated: \u0026ldquo;The involvement of organized soccer fans in Egypt\u0026rsquo;s anti-government protests constitutes every Arab government\u0026rsquo;s worst nightmare. Soccer, alongside Islam, offers a rare platform in the Middle East, a region populated by authoritarian regimes that control all public spaces, for the venting of pent-up anger and frustration.\u0026rdquo; Does this seem familiar?\nSo it looks like the Ultras, which some describe as a social movement, played a self-conscious role in the Egyptian uprising, using the uncensored public space of the football terraces to organize themselves in impressive ways. See (via @techsoc\u0026rsquo;s Twitter feed) this remarkable protest last week over the continued imprisonment of Ultra members following recent protests. The words above the pictures of the imprisoned apparently read \u0026ldquo;Free Fans (Ultras)\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Ultras do use digital technologies to organize themselves, but the primary means is clearly physical. See these videos for a few examples: the Stretford End has nothing on these characters.\nAs we read Streetbook, however, we get a different impression of the Ultras. The narrative that the article conveys is one in which the digital activists of Takriz played the key role while the Ultras themselves are secondary.\nStreetbook highlights Takriz\u0026rsquo;s myriad connections, but presents its \u0026ldquo;main audience\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;alienated street youth: the lifeblood, often spilled, of the rebellion in North Africa\u0026rdquo;. Though the article has many fascinating things to say about the contacts between Takriz and the street groups, it does not support the presentation of Takriz as the primary actor in these contacts, and there is a recurrent classism in the description of how the groups relate.\nSo Pollock describes how the Taks (members of Takriz), including his interviewees \u0026ldquo;Foetus\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Waterman\u0026rdquo;, had the inspiration of \u0026ldquo;turning the spirit (of soccer fans) to political ends\u0026rdquo;, and developing a web forum for Ultras from different teams. Then \u0026ldquo;when the revolution began, the Ultras would come out to play a very different game. They were transformed into a quick-reaction force of bloody-minded rioters.\u0026rdquo; The narrative is that the digital activists shaped the events, transforming soccer hooligans into a \u0026ldquo;bloody-minded\u0026rdquo; political fighting force. But is that what happened? Did initiatives such as the web forum or the Takriz efforts to direct the Ultras have any impact? There is no evidence for this in the article. And there is no voice here from the Ultras themselves. Do they not have anything to say beyond the wielding of sticks? It is remarkable that in all the coverage of the Ultras listed above, there is only one piece that mentions a name. Is digital presence required to have a voice in the debate about what happened in North Africa in 2011? It\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that the importance of digital tools is exaggerated.\nIn the same spirit Streetbook describes how, when the Tunisian regime fell, Egyptian digital activist Hassan Mostafa \u0026ldquo;reached out to some of the hardened criminals, \u0026lsquo;murderers and drug dealers\u0026rsquo;, he had met while imprisoned for his Khaled Said protest: their skills would prove useful in stealing police riot helmets and guns. Through them, Mostafa recruited an army of toughs from the poorest areas.\u0026rdquo; In Tunisia, Takriz leaders \u0026ldquo;use street culture, slang, and obscenities to fire up street youth\u0026rdquo;. Again, the narrative has the digital activists as the brains, and the \u0026ldquo;toughs from the poorest areas\u0026rdquo; with no digital connections are reduced to a tool to be \u0026ldquo;fired up\u0026rdquo;, with no agency of their own.\nThe over-emphasis on digital tools is everywhere in Streetbook. Most obvious is the claim that after visiting (overland, the old way) a group in Serbia, an activist returned with \u0026ldquo;a book about peaceful tactics and a computer game called A Force More Powerful, which lets people play with scenarios for regime change. Taking advantage of the game\u0026rsquo;s Creative Commons license, April 6 members wrote an Egyptian version.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not like in previous times activists haven\u0026rsquo;t shared resources and built on each others\u0026rsquo; work because they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the right clauses in their license agreements. The hacker group Anonymous gets a mention for targeting Tunisian government websites with DDOS \u0026ldquo;attacks\u0026rdquo;, but was Anonymous\u0026rsquo;s action a significant step in the escalation of protest? I doubt it. A Parisian-based activist \u0026ldquo;wrote a script, using semantic search techniques based on keywords… to measure how much time it took for posts to result in responses like comments\u0026rdquo;. There is nothing wrong with such work, but it is clearly secondary – at best – to the main events, but in the Internet-centric \u0026ldquo;digital revolution\u0026rdquo; narrative, it gets a speaking part.\nYet throughout the interview, there are nuggets that reveal an alternative plot between the lines. Despite the focus on YouTube as a mechanism for sharing videos, Foetus describes how the video that \u0026ldquo;made the second half of the [Tunisian] revolution\u0026rdquo; was taken when the regime had shut down the Internet, so \u0026ldquo;according to a Tak who asked to remain anonymous, Takriz smuggled a CD of the video over the Algerian border\u0026rdquo; before forwarding it to Al Jazeera. What I see here is that, while YouTube has made it easier and safer to make videos available (at least so long as Google lets it be done anonymously), when an important video was available, the Internet was not essential to the process of distribution. On December 30 in Tunisia, \u0026ldquo;Lawyers gathered around the country to protest the government and were attacked and beaten\u0026rdquo;, and a week later they all went on strike, followed by the teachers. Lawyers and teachers have their own pre-existing networks, of course, and probably used them to organize – at least there is no mention of a lawyers\u0026rsquo; Facebook page. So while Pollock diligently tracks each use of FourSquare, each request for help over Facebook, each use of emails with attachments, and each fake Twitter account, he skips quickly over the role of leaflets and flyers, meetings in mosques, university campus organizing, television, and balcony-to-balcony messaging.\nThose who are convinced of the progressive potential of digital technologies sometimes accuse sceptics of exaggeration. No one, of course, thinks that Facebook caused the Arab Spring uprisings. But the Internet-centric narrative is not so much wrong in any one particular, as inherently distorted in the overall weight it gives to digital tools. It lends itself to narratives in which technological tools play a central role, in which the direction of influence is \u0026ldquo;from social networks to manifestation in the real world\u0026rdquo;, as Streetbook quotes Samir Garbaya. The nuggets embedded in Streetbook tend to show that, more often than not, digital technologies are one option among several when it comes to the tasks activists face, and that information transmission is commonly not the bottleneck. There is no doubt that Facebook played a significant role in the Egyptian uprising, and that some key videos uploaded to YouTube helped to raise awareness of persecution, but alternatives have existed and do exist, and it is a mistake to pass quickly over these alternatives.\nNext post - which I hope I\u0026rsquo;ll get done in a day or two - is something more constructive. If Internet-centrism is a problem, how do we debate the role of digital technologies in politics? Henry Farrell has an extensive survey of the topic and some fine insights here, and I\u0026rsquo;ll just try to add a few postscripts of my own.\n","date":1316364840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4f48fa594327e58afe3a32255e2c858b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/so-three-cheers-for-evgeny-now-back-to-the-mit-review-articles-some-of-which-display-the-very-internet-centrism-that-moroz/","publishdate":"2011-09-18T16:54:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/so-three-cheers-for-evgeny-now-back-to-the-mit-review-articles-some-of-which-display-the-very-internet-centrism-that-moroz/","section":"post","summary":"So three cheers for Evgeny.

And then, since The Net Delusion came out at the beginning of the year, he\u0026rsquo;s had to put up with a lot of unjustified condescension and caricature from some who suffer from the very \u0026ldquo;Internet-centrism\u0026rdquo; that is the target of his book.\nTake the MIT Technology Review, which just ran a set of writings about the Arab Spring uprisings. The contributors characterize the debate over social media\u0026rsquo;s importance as \u0026ldquo;wildly overdrawn\u0026rdquo; (Aaron Bady); \u0026ldquo;highly polarized\u0026rdquo; (John Pollock), a \u0026ldquo;false debate\u0026rdquo; (Zeynep Tufekci), a \u0026ldquo;false dichotomy\u0026rdquo; (Jillian C. York). And some put Morozov, together with Malcolm Gladwell, at one pole of that debate, with \u0026ldquo;the cyber-utopians\u0026rdquo; at the other. Now Gladwell is a high-profile name who dipped his oar into the waters of digital scepticism in a single article, and he can deal with what he gets from that. But Morozov, judging from his age, is looking to build an academic career on his work and he\u0026rsquo;s at a vulnerable stage, so being the focus of so much attention is both a blessing and a curse.\nIn Streetbook, his contribution to the MIT Review articles, John Pollock summarizes The Net Delusion by writing that \u0026ldquo;[it] decries the \u0026lsquo;naive belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication\u0026rsquo;\u0026ldquo;. Now if you are going to accuse Morozov of being one pole in an overly polarized and, by implication, simplistic debate, you should at least get his position right, and this portrayal is simply unfair. The quotation comes from page xiii of the book\u0026rsquo;s introduction, and is Morozov\u0026rsquo;s portrayal of \u0026ldquo;cyber-utopians\u0026rdquo;. Using this quotation makes it seem that Morozov sees his opponents in exagerrated and simplistic terms. But the bigger target of the book is what Morozov labels \u0026ldquo;Internet-centrism\u0026rdquo;, a setof assumptions that has policy-makers \u0026ldquo;answer[ing] every question about democratic change by first reframing it in terms of the Internet rather than the context in which that change is to occur.\u0026rdquo; {p. xvi}\nMorozov is not a digital dystopian; hell, he owns both a Kindle and an iPad; he writes \u0026ldquo;The premise of this book (The Net Delusion) is thus very simple: To salvage the Internet\u0026rsquo;s promise to aid the fight against authoritarianism, those in the West who still care about the future of democracy will need to ditch both cyber-utopianism and Internet-centrism\u0026rdquo; {p xvii}. His position is well within the confines of mainstream political science — in particular, he accepts the \u0026ldquo;project of promoting democracy\u0026rdquo; as generally a well-intentioned effort from the US, which is a far-from radical stance — so it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable that he has become such a polarizing figure. The Net Delusion is a strong book, but a limitation is that it fails to challenge that project and the intentions behind it sufficiently.\nOver the course of the year, The Net Delusion has become a victim of its own success. Critiques argue that it is time to move beyond \u0026ldquo;duelling anecdotes\u0026rdquo; to a more sophisticated level of analysis, and both Patrick Meier and Mary Joyce (as well as the more predictable Adam Thierer) accuse Morozov of dealing too much in story, not enough in larger-scale data analysis or theoretical work. The accusations miss the point: there was no duel of any significant kind until Morozov stood up against the tide of \u0026ldquo;Twitter Revolution\u0026rdquo; euphoria that erupted along with the Iranian protests in 2009. He introduced a counterweight into a public debate environment that uncritically accepted the thesis that the Internet is intrinsically on the side of dissidents under authoritarian regimes; that the affordances it offers benefit the powerless against the powerful. Having rebalanced the debate, he is now met with a somewhat patronizing declaration that we are past all that, and it is time to move on to more sophisticated and nuanced discourse. Joyce is right when she says that he can be binary in his thinking, and that the book lacks theory, but these accusations are beside the point. It was a book written quickly, in response to the needs of the time, and it met those needs. Arguing that a more subtle, thorough book would be better is to miss the political situation in which it was written, and which it effectively challenged. Morozov deserves a better response from social scientists than he has received.\nDespite the claims of moving beyond the Morozov/Shirky binary debate, some of the MIT Review articles suffer from the very Internet-centrism that Morozov criticizes, in particularly the Streetbook centrepiece. But that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for Part 2.\n","date":1316296429,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f71258a34e47cdb7cb3cefff3b784677","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/internet-centrism-1-of-3-evgeny-morozov-and-the-net-delusion/","publishdate":"2011-09-17T21:53:49Z","relpermalink":"/post/internet-centrism-1-of-3-evgeny-morozov-and-the-net-delusion/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve never met Evgeny Morozov, but I have to say I love the guy because over the last three years he\u0026rsquo;s succeeded in doing something that desperately needed to be done: he\u0026rsquo;s provided a strong counterweight to an overhyped narrative of digital revolution.

I took a look: here\u0026rsquo;s some immediate reactions.\nThe theoretical part of the paper is yet another cascade model of protest, a kind of Granovetter++, which comes down to this:\n Individuals are nodes in a network, and face a decision of protesting or not. Each has a personal threshold for action (in terms of the activity of their neighbours) and some small portion have a zero threshold, acting as seeds for the dynamics.\n Individuals update their threshold based on the level of activity among their neighbours; the more their neighbours are protesting, the more likely they are to join in.\n  The dynamics of the model is the spread of action through the network, a cascade caused by each actor becoming first more prone to action as those around them take up action, and then joining in themselves.\nA \u0026ldquo;media disruption\u0026rdquo; reshapes the network – different media lend themselves to different network structures – and the dynamics of this reshaped network will be different, leading to different regions of activity and inactivity.\nFor many networks, one equilibrium is for almost everyone to be inactive, as each actor has a high threshold for action absorbed from their inactive neighbours. A set of dense connections can freeze regions of a network in states of inactivity: each individual may come in contact with active individuals, but the numerous connections to inactive individuals keeps them mute.\nIndividuals in a less dense network have a greater possibility of becoming active in response to a population of activists because they are less restrained by the inactive people around them, and this is the basic mechanism for the \u0026ldquo;media disruption exacerbates unrest\u0026rdquo; thesis.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like an Ising model of magnetism with ferromagnetic coupling: ions can be spin Up or Down, and their orientation depends on the orientation of their neighbours. One difference: ions don\u0026rsquo;t come with different tendencies to choose Spin Up. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple model - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to model the availability of information itself, or have anything to say about political preferences or economic situation beyond the threshold for action. But it does bring in the relationship between network structure and outcome.\nThere is an empirical part to the paper as well. There is a survey of past revolutions and their relationship to media penetration, which does not convince one way or another (it seems to me there is a conflation of social media and mass media that extends throughout the paper). More interestingly, Hassanpour looks at the progress of the Egyptian uprising and contends that when the government shut down the Internet and phone networks on January 28 it produced, instead of the single gathering at Tahrir Square that had been in progress for several days, eight separate protests in different parts of Cairo. He quotes Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s clear that the very extensive police force in Egypt is no longer able to control these crowds. There are too many protests in too many places.\u0026rdquo; In the absence of a broadly unifying social media that focused attention on the single winner-take-all protest at Tahrir, people were driven out onto the street to see what was happening and generated local protests instead.\nHassanpour suggests three effects of the disruption of the Internet and of the more widely used cell phone networks:\n it upset apolitical citizens, turning them against the government;\n it forced more face-to-face contact;\n it decentralized the rebellion.\n  The facts on the ground are open to many interpretations, of which Hassanpour\u0026rsquo;s is one. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t convince me (I don\u0026rsquo;t have the expertise to judge his empirical evidence) but it\u0026rsquo;s a possibility, and I found it a valuable read.\nDespite the title, the main interest is not whether social media increases or decreases the net level of activity, but that it reshapes it. There is overlap with Kieran Healy\u0026rsquo;s just-posted work-in-progress, The Performativity of Networks, {link} where he argues that network algorithms, when implemented in social media products, \u0026ldquo;reorganize the phenomena they purport to describe\u0026rdquo; (social networks in this case). Facebook is a performance of a theory of friendship.\nDigital technologies have been given credit for an almost endless list of roles in uprisings in authoritarian states. Digital technologies help activist circles to better communicate (blogs, IRC chat, and encrypted communications of various levels of security). They build a broader and deeper public sphere by being a space for open discussion (Facebook and Twitter). They give voice to citizens to speak to the outside world and witness the actions of their government (YouTube videos, Twitter, and blogs). They are a stark contrast to mass media. But they also complement Al Jazeera, who can draw from citizen videos. And they complement offline collaboration and offline organizing as well. Hassanpour points out that digital organizing activities are mainly Internet based while SMS is a medium more suited for on-the-fly information (SMS). In short, there is little that can\u0026rsquo;t be attributed to social media in one form or another.\nHassanpour at least makes a specific claim, that a disruption of digital technologies produced an immediate and tangible reshaping of political activity, and he has a mechanism for his claim. I\u0026rsquo;m sure others will interrogate the evidence. There have been many calls to go beyond \u0026ldquo;duelling anecdotes\u0026rdquo; in looking at the role of social media, and this paper is an attempt to do that. It\u0026rsquo;s flawed, but if you ask me it\u0026rsquo;s going in the right direction.\n","date":1314660897,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"90755ddf148e0624277a1ddc25362f05","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/media-disruption-exacerbates-revolutionary-unrest-notes/","publishdate":"2011-08-29T23:34:57Z","relpermalink":"/post/media-disruption-exacerbates-revolutionary-unrest-notes/","section":"post","summary":"In the New York Times today, there\u0026rsquo;s a piece about a conference paper by Navid Hassanpour, \u0026ldquo;Media Disruption Exacerbates Revolutionary Unrest: Evidence from Mubarak\u0026rsquo;s Natural Experiment\u0026rdquo; {link}.

Nielsen has released a new media-usage report, and it shows that in the first quarter of 2011, the average American watched TV for 158 hours and 47 minutes a month, up another 0.2 percent and, once again, a new all-time high.[*](http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/reports-downloads/2011-Reports/nielsen-cross-platform-report-q1-2011.pdf) Twenty years into the Web revolution, and we're boob-tubier than ever.    \u0026hellip; and more, here.\nMeanwhile, in the mainstream press, the Globe and Mail\u0026rsquo;s John Doyle has been to Beverley Hills to listen to TV execs talk about their line-ups, and they are surprisingly cheery about the state of the biz. A decade ago, according to NBC\u0026rsquo;s Robert Greenblatt, “there was a sense that it’s a declining business, and let’s just sort of manage the decline and hope we can get the best out of it.” Now, things are looking up. Here\u0026rsquo;s CBS chief of research David Poltrack, echoing some of what Nick Carr reports (emphasis is mine):\n   \"As this century opened, the focus of the world was on the Internet, and the focus of the television industry was on the DVR. At that time, the business of prognostication was booming, and no one was too optimistic about the future of the broadcast networks. Yet here we stand 11 years later, and the business of network television is alive and well. That doesn’t mean that the entertainment market has not been transformed by the new technologies. It has. **What the pundits got wrong was not the impact of the new technologies but the alleged vulnerability of the television networks. ... As the broadcasters and the cable networks move more content online, the viewers’ online video diet has included more and more episodes of television programs.**     “It would be no surprise to find, for the first time, a significant number of viewers reporting that they’re watching more television than last year. The fact is, the viewer’s perception of television viewing is program- or content-driven, not distribution-driven. Whether they are watching their favourite program on their computer, their tablet or their smartphone, they consider themselves to be watching television. So contrary to the expectations of the pundits, **the explosion of new sources of video distribution has actually fortified the market for the broadcast networks’ content**.”    A couple of years ago Cosma Shalizi said this about search: \u0026ldquo;If your search process succeeds in aggregating what large numbers of people think, it will mostly reproduce established, mainstream cultural hierarchies, by definition.\u0026rdquo; (link now rotten - no, fixed) The same goes for social media as a whole.\nAlong the same lines, it is perhaps not surprising to see that Wikipedia is, like other institutions, male dominated with less than 10% of edits made by women. The full paper, from the University of Wisconsin, is here.\nFor me, what comes out of these observations is not that the Internet is retrograde \u0026ndash; despite my posts, I do try not to be an old fogy when it comes to technological changes \u0026ndash;but that it is best viewed as a site of contention rather than as an actor in the continuing struggle over the future shape of society.\n","date":1313359304,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1e5451423fa4798f337c6f41664693a0","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/as-tv-goes-online-the-internet-becomes-more-like-tv/","publishdate":"2011-08-14T22:01:44Z","relpermalink":"/post/as-tv-goes-online-the-internet-becomes-more-like-tv/","section":"post","summary":"As I said in my So You Think You Can Dance confession, it\u0026rsquo;s quite possible that the Internet will end up complementing mass media, rather than competing with it.

Plus, Cat Deeley is adorable.\nAnyway, one thing many people do after watching shows like this is see what others are saying on various forums and so on about the performances. And I do the same. It\u0026rsquo;s not just me either - there is a trend for TV shows and the Internet to be jointly marketed (Jeff Probst tweets along with Survivor episodes as they broadcast) and as computers move out of the study (if you have one) and into the living room (hello iPad), it\u0026rsquo;s only going to get bigger. A lot bigger.\nJenny Davis at Cyborgology tells us that the biggest twitter volumes ever recorded were at the end of the Women\u0026rsquo;s World Cup final last month. Glee fans are apparently big at using social media while watching, according to ReadWriteWeb. Yahoo! claims! that! over!80% of! TV! watchers! use a mobile device while watching. The Beeb chimes in with the same kind of numbers. For the TV companies, a big benefit is that social media makes audiences watch the show when it\u0026rsquo;s on, rather than timeshifting it to skip the ads and watch a more convenient time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to get to my point, which is that the standard story of how we have moved from the old world of mass media TV to the fragmented new worlds of the Internet is misleading.

He has no specific evidence, but will that stop our critic of hysterical coverage? It will not. \u0026ldquo;While they may not cause revolutions, there\u0026rsquo;s no question that these kinds of mobile, real-time networks and technologies can help to fuel them when they occur\u0026rdquo; he writes, and then quotes Googler Jared Cohen\u0026rsquo;s claim that \u0026ldquo;social media tools may not be a trigger for such events, but they can clearly act as \u0026lsquo;an accelerant\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;.

I decreed that Dan Gardner\u0026rsquo;s Future Babble was limited, but otherwise OK, and then deemed Tim Harford\u0026rsquo;s Adapt a failed attempt to justify free-market thinking in the aftermath of its biggest failure in decades.\nSo now it\u0026rsquo;s onto the final book of the trio, and my favourite by some distance. Australian Duncan Watts is a physicist-turned sociologist who now works! at! Yahoo! (I called him American a few posts ago. Thanks to Kevin Horgan for correcting me.) You may know Watts from such hits as his explication of network science Six Degrees of Freedom; his Music Lab experiments with Matthew Salganik and Peter Dodds (pdf) showing that social influence can overwhelm any special quality of particular songs in separating hits from misses; and his arguments against Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s The Tipping Point. Each of these reappears in his latest book, Everything is Obvious (Once You Know the Answer) - henceforth EIO (home page).\n(Attention conservation notice: for some reason this took for ever to write and I still don\u0026rsquo;t like it, but I said I\u0026rsquo;d post it so I\u0026rsquo;m damn well going to, and then I can move on.)\nIf I were writing for a real publication I\u0026rsquo;d try to be dispassionate and objective, but the fact is that EIO\u0026rsquo;s goals are ones that I am hugely sympathetic to, and so I found myself cheering Watts along rather than reading him critically. I try not to do this, but between you and me and the wall we all do it to some extent. Certainly the reviewers of Adapt could have used a little less enthusiasm and a little more critical thinking before putting their praise in print. Still, I do think that EIO is the book that Adapt and Future Babble were trying to be.\nAccording to its subtitle, EIO is about \u0026ldquo;how common sense fails us\u0026rdquo;, but this is misleading. \u0026ldquo;Common sense\u0026rdquo; has become a shorthand for anti-intellectual conservative approaches to government and social problems based on down-home practical experience, as in Common Sense Revolution, but Watts has a more ambitious target than that; \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo; is the need (among intellectuals and others alike) to impose patterns on current events and on history, and our belief that once we see these patterns we will have a better grasp of the future.\nOn the one hand, the achievements of common sense are easily overlooked, but remarkable. Our socially-honed and culturally-specific intuitions are remarkably good at helping us to navigate the maze of implicit rules and norms that help society function. Common sense has proven subtle enough to derail whole avenues of artificial intelligence research.\nOn the other hand, the strengths of common sense in navigating the particulars of travelling the subway or getting by in the workplace are weaknesses when it comes to understanding anything other than everyday life. Common sense is \u0026ldquo;not so much a worldview as a grab bag of logically inconsistent, often contradictory beliefs, each of which seems right at the time but carries no guarantee of being right at any other time\u0026rdquo; (17). When it comes to understanding society, we appeal to it at our peril.\nWatts\u0026rsquo;s most obvious target is the kind of thinking that is commonplace in business, in politics, and in punditry – analogies, stories, and overextended but half-baked theories. But as a sociologist, Watts also has in his sights the economists\u0026rsquo; belief that sociology is plagued by woolly thinking, and that economists can do sociologists\u0026rsquo; work more rigorously and with more insight than sociologists themselves because economists understand incentives. He quotes from Freakonomics: \u0026ldquo;The typical economist believes that the world has not yet invented a problem that he [sic] cannot fix if given a free hand to design the proper incentive scheme\u0026rdquo; (51).\nThe usual modern take against homo economicus theories of society is that we are not rational beings. But the problem is not just that \u0026ldquo;our mental model of individual behavior is systematically flawed\u0026rdquo;, although Watts does run through failures of framing, priming and other foibles of the Predictably Irrational kind. The problem I\u0026rsquo;ve always had with such psychological explanations of our failures is that, once we are made aware of our systematic flaws, we can surely work on overcoming them. Would that solve the problem?\nWell no. And it\u0026rsquo;s not just that we sumble into fallacies of composition either, although he does show why intuitions and theories based on \u0026ldquo;representative individuals\u0026rdquo; whose \u0026ldquo;actions stand in for the actions and interactions of the many\u0026rdquo; are both tempting and doomed to fail. The focus on \u0026ldquo;special individuals\u0026rdquo; as the sparks that light the fires of viral success, Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Law of the Few\u0026rdquo;, also comes in for debunking, including some convincing experiments based on Twitter cascades. And expertise as a whole is not of much use: Chapter 6 covers much of what\u0026rsquo;s in Future Babble. But the smartest and most self-confident will still see themselves, plausibly, as able to surmount these barriers, cutting through the deadwood to find real causes, real incentives, and real mechanisms.\nWatts continues though. It is in his treatment of successes and failures that he makes his strongest arguments. Watts convincingly shows many suggested explanations of successes, from the Mona Lisa to Facebook, to be exercises in circular thinking, where \u0026ldquo;Harry Potter was successful because it had exactly the attributes of Harry Potter, and not something else\u0026rdquo; (60). It is tempting to think that there is something special about the Mona Lisa that causes it to be the most famous painting in the world, some quality that it has that no other painting has. But there isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nIn the Music Lab experiments, different \u0026ldquo;worlds\u0026rdquo; of listeners were given a set of songs to listen to and, in some cases, information on the listening history of others in their world. The experiment showed that songs that were hits in some worlds were unpopular in others, and that this variation came about specifically because of the information about others\u0026rsquo; listening histories. Not only is it a mistake to look for Gladwell-like \u0026ldquo;special people\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s also a mistake to look for special qualities in hit songs as the \u0026ldquo;cause\u0026rdquo; of their success. As the fictional Mark Zuckerberg says to the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network, \u0026ldquo;if you had invented Facebook, you would have invented Facebook\u0026rdquo;. There was no crucial idea that separated Facebook from the pack; it just separated from the pack because social networks are governed by cumulative advantage, and that\u0026rsquo;s how cumulative advantage works.\nAnd he doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. We\u0026rsquo;ve perhaps read before that \u0026ldquo;history is only run once\u0026rdquo;, causing us to mistakenly \u0026ldquo;perceive what actually happened as having been inevitable\u0026rdquo; (112), but Watts goes further in explaining why we misunderstand the causes of events: events themselves are identifiable only in hindsight. Was \u0026ldquo;the US financial crisis of 2008\u0026rdquo; a blip in the recent history of capitalism, or was it just the first part of \u0026ldquo;the international financial crisis of 2008 to 2015\u0026rdquo;, including the splitup of the euro zone and who knows what else? We can only know in hindsight.\nIn summary, Watts is saying not only that the \u0026ldquo;right lever\u0026rdquo; is difficult to find when it comes to understanding society, but that in many social phenomena there never was a lever at all; \u0026ldquo;what appear to us to be causal explanations are in fact just stories — descriptions of what happened that tell us little, if anything, about the mechanisms at work\u0026rdquo; (27).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot here, and by two-thirds of the way through the book I was happily convinced that I would never again need to reach for a business strategy or populist social science book. It\u0026rsquo;s a thorough and convincing debunking of attempts to understand the chaotic path of social progress.\nThe difficulty, of course, is that once the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s nudity has been pointed out, the man still needs a set of clothes. What to put in the place of mistaken theories? Part II is an attempt to address this question, and it\u0026rsquo;s less successful than part I. There are three main chapters (Chapter 7 belongs, to my mind, in Part I rather than Part II). Chapter 8 covers much the same ground as Adapt, with some of the same suggestions: experiment, measure and react, rely on prediction as little as possible. Condensed into one chapter I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind this as much as I did in Adapt, but it\u0026rsquo;s still the weakest chapter in the book. It\u0026rsquo;s a smattering of ideas, some stronger than others, but still searching for that magic recipe which he has just convinced us doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nChapter 9 is far more interesting though. If success and failure are governed largely by luck, how does that affect our views of society? Watts looks at theories of justice in the light of what Part I has told us, and comes out firmly in favour of an egalitarian, or at least Rawlsian, point of view. It\u0026rsquo;s just one chapter, and Watts would (I would guess) be the first to admit it\u0026rsquo;s just an introduction, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bold step for a book on popular social science to take, and a valuable one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough that I forgive Watts his final chapter, which is really a set of reflections on physics and sociology that somehow forgets to mention that of all the natural sciences to base social theories on, especially when you have convinced us that specifics of particular situations are crucial, physics is surely the least plausible. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget how little predictive success physics has. Sure it does a good job with the tides, but even the best physics theories of complex phenomena (say the BCS theory of superconductivity for example, or the Kondo model) have little success when it comes to prediction. BCS did not guide or anticipate the discovery of high-temperature superconductors, for example.\nAfter reading these three books I am left with several unanswered questions about how to proceed once we know that large parts of the future are hidden from view? When it comes to decisions, well we still need to make them (including big and irreversible decisions) even in the face of uncertainty, but can we still put heart and soul into new initiatives when we know that their outcome is, at least in part, out of our control? How do you motivate teams without misrepresenting the role of luck? How do we approach questions of reward and punishment when the consequences of our actions are unforeseeable? I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s lots out there on these questions, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking for it with a new appreciation of their importance. Any suggestions on places to start?\n","date":1310141866,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"229e031d870d8c36aece51a64113f165","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/an-uncertain-world-iii-everything-is-obvious-by-duncan-j-watts/","publishdate":"2011-07-08T16:17:46Z","relpermalink":"/post/an-uncertain-world-iii-everything-is-obvious-by-duncan-j-watts/","section":"post","summary":"Before leaving for a holiday (it was lovely; thanks for asking) I was going through a trio of books on the topical topic of \u0026ldquo;prediction is difficult, especially of the future\u0026rdquo;.

Apparently Nature, the Sunday Times, and the Financial Times loved the book, and his review page has nice comments from lots of smart people, but here goes anyway.\nTable of Contents\n The thesis\n The contradiction\n Consequences\n Capecchi and Tharp\n Whole Foods, Timpson, Chile, and Wal-Mart\n  Centralized experimentation\n The Financial Crisis\n Foxes and Hedgehogs\n If not trial-and-error, then what?\n  The thesis Adapt argues that, to deal with the complexity and unpredictability of the modern world, we should take our inspiration from the market, and apply its methods to other parts of our world. It opens with a quotation from Hayek, and Harford is inspired by the market\u0026rsquo;s evolutionary, decentralized, trial-and-error nature. Individual firms may fail in large numbers, but that is not a problem for the whole: \u0026ldquo;The difference between market-based economies and centrally-planned disasters, such as Mao Zedong\u0026rsquo;s Great Leap Forward, is not that markets avoid failure. It\u0026rsquo;s that large-scale failures do not seem to have the same dire consequences for the market as they do for planned economies.\u0026rdquo; (11)\nThe year 2011 is an odd time to make such an argument, even though he does follow the above sentence with \u0026ldquo;The most obvious exception to this claim is also the most interesting: the financial crisis that began in 2007. We\u0026rsquo;ll find out why it was such a catastrophic anomaly in chapter six\u0026rdquo;. (11)\nHarford continues: \u0026ldquo;trial and error is a tremendously powerful process for solving problems in a complex world, while expert leadership is not. Markets harness this process of trial and error, but that does not mean that we should leave everything to the market. It does mean - in the face of seemingly intractable problems, such as civil war, climate change and financial instability - that we must find a way to use the secret of trial and error beyond the familiar context of the market.\u0026rdquo; (20)\nAnd Harford prescribes his remedy liberally: \u0026ldquo;The adaptive, experimental approach [trial and error] can work almost anywhere\u0026rdquo; (35) he says, and he applies it to climate change (chapter five), to business strategy (chapter seven), to individuals (chapter eight), and to financial collapses (chapter six).\nThe contradiction\nTheorem: In systems with multiple levels, trial-and-error cannot be an optimal strategy at each level.\nProof (by contradiction, and a bit like the Unexpected Hanging Paradox):\nConsider an economy consisting of a government, firms, and employees. There are two sets of decision-maker in this economy: the government must decide on a strategy for the economy as a whole and firms must decide how they will instruct their employees to work.\nTo keep things really simple, limit the available strategy space for each decision-maker to only two options:\n trial-and-error delegates decisions to the level below (government to firms, firms to employees)\n _eggs-in-one-basket _mandates to the lower level what they must do.\n  If trial-and-error is the optimal strategy at the level of the economy, the government will adopt it, allowing each firm to identify and pursue a strategy of its own. Some firms will choose trial-and-error, while others adopt eggs-in-one-basket. Which firms will succeed? There are two cases.\nCase A: some trial-and-error firms succeed, and some eggs-in-one-basket firms succeed. In this case, trial-and-error is not the optimal choice at the level of the firm, it is simply one strategy among others (the others in this case being eggs-in-one-basket) that may be worth pursuing.\nCase B: only trial-and-error firms succeed. In this case, trial-and-error is the optimal strategy for firms. But (here\u0026rsquo;s the catch) if trial-and-error is the best strategy at the level of the firm, then the optimal strategy for the government is eggs-in-one-basket, mandating that all firms must operate in a specific (trial-and-error) fashion.\nIn short, if trial-and-error is the best strategy at the level of government, then we cannot say it is the best strategy at the level of the individual firm. And if it is the best strategy at the level of the firm, it cannot be the best strategy at the level of the economy.\nConsequences The contradiction appears in stories throughout the book. Here are two examples.\nCapecchi and Tharp Adapt tells us the stories of Mario Capecchi (pp 97–100) and of Twyla Tharp (pp 247–256).\nTharp is a brilliant and determined choreographer whose ambitious production Movin\u0026rsquo; Out was panned when it premiered in Chicago. According to Adapt, Tharp is a believer in the process of experimentation, filming hours of improvised dance in the search for just a few interesting moves. She treated the Chicago experience as a failed experiment and \u0026ldquo;made peace with her losses and immediately set about the hard work of winning back both the critics and the audiences.\u0026rdquo; (254) She reworked the show, and the result was a piece of groundbreaking dance that won her rave reviews when it moved to Broadway. An inspiring story.\nCapecchi is a brilliant and determined biologist whose ambitious proposal to \u0026ldquo;make a specific, targeted change to a gene in a mouse\u0026rsquo;s DNA\u0026rdquo; (99) was panned when he submitted it to the NIH funding agency. According to Adapt, Capecchi is a \u0026ldquo;stubborn genius\u0026rdquo; who survived a remarkable childhood as a street urchin. He refused to treat the NIH proposal as a failed experiment, refused to make peace with his losses, and instead treated the NIH experience as an obstacle to be worked around. He got grants for two other less-ambitious projects and used that money to carry out his panned mouse-gene project anyway. The result was a piece of groundbreaking research that won him the 2007 Nobel Prize in medicine. An inspiring story.\nHarford uses the story of Twyla Tharp to promote the virtues of trial-and-error at the level of individual, and the story of Mario Capecchi to promote the virtues of trial-and-error at the level of the organization. But trial-and-error at the organization level means accommodating people like Capecchi, who is clearly not a trial-and-error individual and who exhibits precisely those traits (rejecting critics views, refusal to change) that Harford warns us against in the Tharp story.\nWhole Foods, Timpson, Chile, and Wal-Mart Adapt tells us the story of American high-end grocery chain Whole Foods and UK bric-a-brac retailer Timpson (pp 224–230). These two companies promote decentralization and experimentation, giving teams (in the case of Whole Foods) or stores (in the case of Timpson) independence from the company so that they can find their own successful strategies. Both exemplify Hayek\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;now familiar words \u0026ldquo;knowledge of the particular circumstance of time and place\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; (227). Harford uses their stories to show that \u0026ldquo;the world is increasingly rewarding those who can quickly adapt to local circumstances\u0026rdquo; and to promote strategies such as delegation of power to the front lines of the organization. Peer monitoring \u0026ldquo;offers a subtlety and sensitivity that monitoring from corporate HQ simply cannot match\u0026rdquo; (229).\nHe contrasts the decentralized efforts of Whole Foods and Timpson with the failure of centralized planning, exemplified by \u0026ldquo;one of the most surreal examples of the planner\u0026rsquo;s dream\u0026rdquo; (69), Salvador Allende\u0026rsquo;s Project CyberSyn which looked to use a supercomputer to collect centralized reports of economic activity throughout Chile in the early 1970\u0026rsquo;s and to tune the economy. The project was \u0026ldquo;not a success\u0026rdquo;, and shows us \u0026ldquo;the way in which our critical faculties switch off when faced with the latest technology.\u0026rdquo; (70) The dream of \u0026ldquo;information delivered in detail, real-time, to a command centre from which computer-aided decisions could be sent back to the front line\u0026rdquo; persisted in the form of Donald Rumsfeld and his failed conduct of the Iraq invasion (chapter 2). The lesson is that \u0026ldquo;such [centralized] systems always deliver less than they promise, because they remain incapable of capturing the tacit knowledge that really matters.\u0026rdquo; (71)\nWal-Mart is mentioned only briefly in Adapt, on p 226. \u0026ldquo;Of course, this kind of business model [Whole Foods] is not the only way to succeed in the supermarket trade. Far more centralised supermarkets such as Wal-Mart in the US and Tesco in the UK are clearly very profitable\u0026rdquo;.\nWal-Mart owes its success to massive centralization of a kind that makes Project CyberSyn look unambitious. Famously, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2007 that \u0026ldquo;Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s centralized thermostat system in Bentonville, Arkansas, its corporate headquarters, actually uses a monitoring team to control the temperature for every store from this centralized location.\u0026rdquo; Centralization and scale permit remorseless cost-cutting precisely by minimizing local experimentation even in such minute decisions as store temperature.\nAgain, the contradiction plays out. Harford wants to argue that at the level of the economy as a whole and at the level of the individual firm, trial-and-error triumphs over misguided centralization. Yet trial-and-error at the level of the economy permits individual firms like Wal-Mart to pursue centralized, eggs-in-one-basket strategies, some of which turn out to be better than experimentation. You can\u0026rsquo;t eat your cake and have it too.\nCentralized experimentation Harford does note that Wal-Mart and Tesco \u0026ldquo;still experiment but have managed to centralise and automate that experimentation\u0026rdquo; (226), but gives no further details. This sentence shows another failure of the book: a blurring of the line between experimentation (trial-and-error) and decentralization. Throughout most of the book he uses experimentation as a synonym for decentralization (tacit knowledge and all that) and is in favour of both, but sometimes - as here - he separates the two to make his argument fit.\nThe most dramatic case where he separates experimentation from decentralization is in the chapter on development aid (chapter 4). Part of the issue in pursuing a trial-and-error strategy is to identify successes – to design a \u0026ldquo;feedback loop\u0026rdquo; that permits successful ideas to evolve further – and chapter 4 looks at the use of randomized trials in development projects to provide that feedback.\nHarford argues throughout chapter 4 that development aid projects can easily go wrong despite, or because of, the best intentions of those involved. To identify successful strategies he argues for rigorous experimentation based on clinical trial methodologies, and randomized trials. Why, I wondered throughout this chapter, does the use of randomized trials come up particularly in the area of development aid? I believe (and here I may be atributing ideas to Harford that are not his) that it comes from the usual economist\u0026rsquo;s idea that in development aid we must avoid woolly, sentimental thinking and adopt a hard-headed approach if we are really to Do the Right Thing.\nThe problem is, randomized trials are often not incentive compatible for the participants. In one example, Harford describes an experiment in Kenya to deliver a new set of textbooks to schools. The charity funding the programme \u0026ldquo;chose twenty-five schools at random\u0026rdquo; and distributed the books. The experimenters found, surprisingly, \u0026ldquo;little evidence that textbooks were helpful\u0026rdquo;. Chalk one up for randomized trials.\n(I\u0026rsquo;m going a bit out on a limb for the next few paragraphs: if others with more knowledge of the subject can correct me, go for it).\nWhat are the incentives at work at the level of the individual school? Given a choice between a set of new textbooks and no set of new textbooks, most schools would choose the books because the expectation was that they would improve the education experience. To succeed, randomized trials demand either a setup where there is no expectation of likely outcomes (as in another example he gives, an 18th century sea doctor treating scurvy with \u0026ldquo;oranges and lemons\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cider, acid, or brine\u0026rdquo;), or where the subjects of the experiment are deprived of the right to choose. If there is an expectation, going in to the experiment, that one option or the other is more likely to be beneficial, then it is in the interests of the experimental subjects to go with that option rather than participate in a randomized trial.\nIt is not surprising that Harford can find stories of randomized trials in the case of medicine and of development aid. Both scenarios rely on a powerless, voiceless set of experimental subjects. In scenarios where the subjects have a voice, randomized trials are rare despite their system-wide benefits because the incentives don\u0026rsquo;t line up. Are there cases of trials in North American or British school systems where a random selection of schools get access to a new, potentially beneficial teaching aid? If there are, Harford has apparently not found them.\nSo here again the contradiction is at work. Trial-and-error at the level of the development project demands centralized control. The school textbook project demands that trial-and-error not be an option at the level of the individual school.\nSuch contradictions occur throughout the book. I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about development aid or randomized testing, but I do know a bit about technology. Harford gives Google a positive write-up for its famous \u0026ldquo;20% time\u0026rdquo; program for employees (pp 231–234), showing that it succeeds by casting aside those projects that fail. But in demonstrating why failures need to be rigorously abandoned (a \u0026ldquo;tight feedback loop\u0026rdquo;) he writes \u0026ldquo;According to the TechRepublic website, two of the five worst technology products of 2009 came from Google - and they were major Google products at that, Google Wave and the Android 1.0 operating system for mobile phones. Yet most internet users know and rely on Google\u0026rsquo;s search, Google Maps and Image search, while many others swear by Gmail, Google Reader, and Blogger.\u0026rdquo; (234). By his own logic, Google should have abandoned the duds, and it did throw Wave overboard, but of course in the case of Android it persisted and now Android is the most widely-used smartphone operating system in the world. And Google Maps and Blogger, at least, are not products of the innovation program but were developed outside Google and then purchased.\nAdapt also uses business professor Clayton Christensen\u0026rsquo;s Innovator\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma to bolster its case, in which Christensen shows how surprisingly primitive but cheap and \u0026ldquo;good-enough\u0026rdquo; technologies tend to displace advanced, high-end technologies in a process called \u0026ldquo;disruptive innovation\u0026rdquo;. For the record, I found that to be an excellent book. But I first heard Christensen talk on the subject at a BlackBerry conference where he explained that the threat to BlackBerry was that its end-to-end design was vulnerable to a horizontal model that would not give the same highly-tuned experience, but which would do a good-enough job at lower prices. It sounded convincing, but within a year (I think) the real competitor turned out to be Apple\u0026rsquo;s iPhone - an even more high-end, even more end-to-end design, and quite the opposite of the prediction. Apple, of course, is a hugely centralized company that puts all its eggs in one basket when it releases new technologies.\nThe Financial Crisis\nBy this time, you can see that I think Adapt suffers from the very cognitive dissonance that its author warns against in his final chapter. In the face of contrary evidence, the author finds ways to accommodate the facts within his framework by stretching the argument in ways that are ultimately unconvincing. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly this kind of flaw that Tetlock identified among his worst-performing experts (the hedgehogs). Nowhere is it more obvious than in Adapt\u0026rsquo;s chapter on the financial crisis.\nTo identify successful strategies, Harford argues that \u0026ldquo;we should not try to design a better world. We should make better feedback loops\u0026rdquo; (140) so that failures can be identified and successes capitalized on. Harford just asserts that \u0026ldquo;a market provides a short, strong feedback loop\u0026rdquo; (141), because \u0026ldquo;If one cafe is ordering a better combination of service, range of food, prices, decor, coffee blend, and so on, then more customers will congregate there than at the cafe next door\u0026rdquo;, but everyday small-scale examples like this have little to do with markets for credit default swaps or with any other large-scale operation.\nThe chapter on the financial crisis misses the boat completely.\nOne part of the chapter deals with arranging incentives to encourage whistleblowers. There is only one problem with this, which is that a lack of whistleblowers was not the problem with the mortgage market. There were people who saw the market coming, said so, and put money behind their words, and their stories have been chronicled in books like Michael Lewis\u0026rsquo;s The Big Short. But such people were written off as Chicken Littles. The problem was that the \u0026ldquo;short, strong feedback loop\u0026rdquo; of the market was neither short nor strong: it sent fundamentally misleading messages, because that\u0026rsquo;s what a bubble is.\nThe second idea Adapt has about financial crises is to provide greater visibility for regulators into problems and stresses in a system, and it is illustrated by a story about the final weekend in September 2008, as Lehmann Brothers collapsed. But again, that weekend was simply the final bursting of the pimple and, while replaying that weekend may have led to different outcomes, the time was long past when the crisis could have been averted.\nThe final idea is borrowed from engineering systems, and has been floated again by others recently (Justin Fox here), and is to decouple various parts of the financial system so that failures in one area cannot spill over to failures in other areas. This may or may not work - I\u0026rsquo;m no expert - but I can say this: the proposal has nothing to do with the thesis of the book. The coupling between different parts of the financial system came about precisely because of an unwarranted belief in the virtues of the innovative, market-driven processes that Harford is promoting, and were governed by exactly the kind of feedback that he relies on (price, profits) elsewhere.\nFoxes and Hedgehogs Like Future Babble (see previous post), Harford includes the work of Philip Tetlock early in the book, to show us not to trust experts. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But he fails to see the depth of the paradox of expert failure: it applies to those who would replace experts as much as it applies to experts themselves.\nTetlock divided his experts into foxes (good at many things) and hedgehogs (good at one thing) and argued that hedgehogs are over-confident because they \u0026ldquo;reduce the problem to some core theoretical scheme\u0026rsquo;… and they used that theme over and over, like a template, to stamp out predictions\u0026rdquo;. And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what Harford does here. He sees evolution as a fox-like strategy (trying many things and selecting a few) but doesn\u0026rsquo;t notice that at the level of individual species, evolution gives us both foxes and hedgehogs, and both do perfectly fine.\nOnce the contradiction at the heart of the book is clear, it is not surprising that the book itself cherry picks examples where trial-and-error has succeeded, or where eggs-in-one-basket has failed. But such stories, while entertaining, make a notoriously shaky foundation for any kind of general structure, and so it proves here.\nIf not trial-and-error, then what? So in the end, Harford fails in his attempt to sell trial-and-error as a panacea. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to knock, I can hear you say, but do you have anything better to offer? Well probably not, but let me at least sketch some preliminary thoughts very briefly.\nBoth Gardner and (especially) Harford place great emphasis on the usefulness of particular knowledge, and the need to recognize our limitations when it comes to seeing the future and to planning. \u0026ldquo;Allow room to experiment, to revise, and to adapt\u0026rdquo; is not bad advice so far as it goes. But Harford pushes this argument too far, and so tumbles into contradiction. He seeks to use this lesson as a general, all-purpose lesson, which means that he is again failing to acknowledge our limitations when it comes to seeing the future and to planning.\nWe need to accept that there is no algorithm for success. In fact, any such recipe would be self-defeating. The process of achieving success is irreducibly specific, irreducibly individual, and irreducibly paradoxical. It is not the realm of science, logic and analysis - it is the realm of art, precisely because art is comfortable with paradox and self-contradiction in a way that science and logic is not.\nOr: \u0026ldquo;If I knew the jazz of the future, I\u0026rsquo;d play it\u0026rdquo; as someone said.\n","date":1307196462,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"62ab71a8639d5b365b4c0142f66abaa3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/an-uncertain-world-ii-adapt-by-tim-harford/","publishdate":"2011-06-04T14:07:42Z","relpermalink":"/post/an-uncertain-world-ii-adapt-by-tim-harford/","section":"post","summary":"Another long post: PDF here (but lacking some last minute changes) for anyone who prefers it.\nThere is a contradiction at the heart of Adapt, the new book by the Financial Times\u0026rsquo; Undercover Economist, Tim Harford, and once the contradiction is unpicked, the rest of the book unfortunately unravels.

The consensus is that prediction is difficult, especially about the future, as everyone from Neils Bohr to Yogi Berra is supposed to have said, and so the questioning extends to the closely-related topic of how to act in the face of a future that we cannot foresee?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve just read three books on these topics, by a Canadian, a Briton, and an American, and I\u0026rsquo;ll do a post on each. Today, it\u0026rsquo;s Dan Gardner\u0026rsquo;s Future Babble. Next up is Tim Harford\u0026rsquo;s Adapt, and I\u0026rsquo;ll finish with Duncan Watts\u0026rsquo; Everything is Obvious Once You Know the Answer. Time-saver: on a scale of one to five, Gardner gets 2, Harford 1.5, and Watts 4.\nSo, Future Babble. It\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward journalistic book built on the work of psychologist Philip Tetlock, who also figures prominently in _Adapt_and makes an appearance in Everything is Obvious. Tetlock (home page) is famous for an extended experiment in which he assembled \u0026ldquo;284 experts - political scientists, economists, and journalists - whose jobs involve commenting on or giving advice on political or economic trends.\u0026rdquo;(p25) Several years and over 28,000 predictions later, he assessed their results and concluded that, on average, experts did only a little better than \u0026ldquo;a dart-throwing chimpanzee\u0026rdquo;, and by some measures no better at all.\nNot all experts did equally badly though, and Tetlock was able to identify the traits that made for more and less successful punditry. Those who did particularly badly \u0026ldquo;were not comfortable with complexity and uncertainty [and] sought to \u0026lsquo;reduce the problem to some core theoretical scheme\u0026rsquo;… and they used that theme over and over, like a template, to stamp out predictions. These experts were also more confident than others that their predictions were accurate.\u0026rdquo; (26) Those who did well \u0026ldquo;drew information and ideas from multiple sources and sought to synthesize it. They were self-critical, always questioning whether what they believed to be true really was… Most of all, these experts were comfortable seeing the world as complex and uncertain - so comfortable that they tended to doubt the ability of anyone to predict the future.\u0026rdquo;\nIn other words, \u0026ldquo;The experts who were more accurate than others tended to be much less confident that they were right.\u0026rdquo; (27)\nTetlock calls his less-unsuccessful experts \u0026ldquo;foxes\u0026rdquo; (those who know many things) and the even-more-unsuccessful ones \u0026ldquo;hedgehogs\u0026rdquo; (those who know one big thing), after an essay by Isaiah Berlin.\nFuture Babble chronicles many failed prophets and their off-base predictions, and shows how hedgehogs hold on to their beliefs even in the light of their continued failure. His stories are weighted towards prophets of doom (Paul Ehrlich gets particularly harsh treatment, but Y2K, Peak Oil, Arnold Toynbee\u0026rsquo;s theory of history, the inexorable rise of Japan and many others get a mention) although some pollyannas are included too (Dow 36,000, for example). The impression I was left with is that Gardner sees unorthodox, cultist predictions as particularly likely to be false.\nThe bad news does not stop here, Gardner tells us. Not only are experts unsuccessful at prediction, and not only are \u0026ldquo;hedgehog\u0026rdquo; experts even worse than others, but the experts most in demand as TV pundits, keynote speakers, and corporate consultants are overwhelmingly those spiky, one big idea types. It is not reassuring that companies not entirely unlike the one I work for look to exactly this kind of expert to guide their strategy. Why do hedgehogs do well? As the book\u0026rsquo;s subtitle tells us, while Gardner spends much of his book exploring \u0026ldquo;why expert predictions fail\u0026rdquo; he does also explore \u0026ldquo;why we believe them anyway\u0026rdquo;, mainly in Chapter 6.\nThe roots of our love for hedgehogs despite their objectively bad rates of success are, he argues, psychological. Gardner leans heavily on the work of Kahnemann and Tversky on the psychology of decision-making and behavioural economics - priming, the availability heuristic and so on - material that has appeared many times in popular books over recent years, and backs this up with several other hedgehog-loving traits: our tendency to follow authority (Milgram yet again1), our love of \u0026ldquo;simple, clean, confident\u0026rdquo; messages delivered in easily-digestible story form, the media\u0026rsquo;s focus on successful predictions and its sieve-like memory for unsuccessful ones, and our own similar tendencies. To my mind, Gardner understates the social and political sources of demand for expert prediction in favour of the psychological. The spread of an idea depends on how easily it can diffuse through a network of people, and the psychology of people is only one factor that governs that diffusion. Some ideas are easy to communicate from one person to another, others difficult. Some messages inherently generate new connections (\u0026ldquo;communication is good for you!\u0026rdquo;) whereas others reshape networks so as to make spreading different (\u0026ldquo;silence is golden\u0026rdquo;).\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in the book is interesting, and entertaining enough. The problem is, Future Babble stops too soon and leaves many questions unanswered. Skewering the failed predictions of the past is, after all, an easy game. What we need to know is how to distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones, and how to proceed in the face of unpredictability.\nThe problems with prediction are chaotic systems driven by non-linearity, the unpredictability of people, and the fact that interactions among people often makes the future more, rather than less, tricky to predict. But not all predictions are hopeless; the weather in some parts of the world is unpredictable, but it\u0026rsquo;s easy to predict that Arizona in August will be hot and dry. It is difficult to foresee the future shape of our digital world, but Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law has been with us for five decades, and I Hereby Predict that the computer chips of the future will be smaller and faster than those of today. Chaotic systems are ubiquitous, but not everything is chaotic. Distinguishing one from the other would be helpful, and although prediction is the subject of the book, Gardner does little to spell out exactly what kind of predictions he is talking about. He focuses on big economic, ecological, and political predictions, but is not clear about how broad a net he is casting. And while he spends much of his time skewering hedgehogs, it seems to me that there were many foxes who did not see the financial crisis coming as well.\nAnd there is a contradiction at the heart of the book. Dan Gardner has written a simple, clean and confident argument to warn us against simple, clean and confident arguments. He tells us stories to warn us of the dangers of placing too much faith in stories. He gives us a book with one big idea (\u0026ldquo;Why Expert Predictions Fail and Why We Believe Them Anyway\u0026rdquo;), which is that big ideas are the most likely to be wrong. Perhaps the book needs to be written this way - part of his message, after all, is that everyone loves hedgehogs - but surely the contradictions deserve to be addressed?\nWhile some predictions are disinterested forecasts of the future, many are made because we want to take actions that affect that future, and want to choose the right action: if we do this, then we can bring about that. Gardner quotes Kenneth Arrow at the beginning of his final chapter: \u0026ldquo;The Commanding General is well aware the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.\u0026rdquo;(p237) But he does not really engage with the question of how to make decisions in the absence of reliable forecasts beyond general exhortations to caution and humility. These are fine so far as they go, but they do not take us very far. What are we supposed to do about the continued success of unreliable \u0026ldquo;hedgehogs\u0026rdquo;?\nTake my job. I work for a software company as something called a product manager, and one of the things product managers do is argue for new products, new product directions and new features. So I\u0026rsquo;m trying to influence decisions the company makes and using predictions to do it, while others are arguing for alternative courses. And many of those predictions, mine and theirs, are Future Babble. So what do I do? Do I take the tactical route of arguing over-confidently, hedgehog like, for my position - essentially lying about my confidence in my predictions? Or do I act like a fox and look on as the decisions inevitably follow the suggestions of more charismatic presenters? If what I want is for my ideas to be taken on board, then I guess I should put my scruples to one side and become a hedgehog. But that\u0026rsquo;s not really what I want: what I really want is for the right decision to be taken, and sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the one I am arguing for. I was hoping for inspiration and insight into these concrete issues around my daily work, but found nothing.\nI enjoyed much of Future Babble, but in the end found it too limited to warrant recommendation. So I went on to the next book - Tim Harford\u0026rsquo;sAdapt - in search of answers. Next post, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you whether I found them.\n1 Is it just me, or is the standard interpretation of the classic Milgram electric shock experiment all wrong? Participants followed instructions to administer \u0026ldquo;shocks\u0026rdquo;, judging that the authority figure in the white coat would not tell them to do something harmful without good reason, even though it looked like the subject was feeling pain. And… the participants were 100% right to trust their judgement. The subject was not feeling pain, and the authority figure was not instructing the participant to do something terrible. Why is this anything other than a story of good judgement on the part of the participants?\nHTML generated by org-mode 7.4 in emacs 23\n","date":1306878830,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d06cafb4d4f32b97e406d9f2fa0e07ea","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/an-uncertain-world-1-future-babble-by-dan-gardner/","publishdate":"2011-05-31T21:53:50Z","relpermalink":"/post/an-uncertain-world-1-future-babble-by-dan-gardner/","section":"post","summary":"After the spectacular failure of financial experts everywhere to predict the 2008 crash the whole business of prediction has come under scrutiny.

Time to Stop Talking About Social Media? The debates continue about the role of digital technologies and social media in the Arab/North African uprisings. I was lucky enough to be invited to a workshop last week on Blogs and Bullets: Social Media and the Struggle for Political Change and this post is prompted by some of the fascinating things I heard there.\nTime was when we were trapped in what Henry Farrell describes as \u0026ldquo;a seemingly never-ending debate which seemed to have a lot of very grand claims – The Internet Is Leading To Sliced Freedom and Democracy! Noes! It It is The Autocrat’s Best Friend and so on – combined with a near-total dearth of reliable evidence.\u0026rdquo; But some say such arguments are now obsolete; that we all know the real questions are more complicated than that.1\nStill, after the pleas for \u0026ldquo;nuance\u0026rdquo; have been made,2 we are often left with a weak determinism, a residual belief in \u0026ldquo;the internet\u0026rsquo;s special power to connect and liberate\u0026rdquo; (Cory Doctorow in his review of Evgeny Morozov\u0026rsquo;s Net Delusion), and a conviction that \u0026ldquo;The internet is inherently a force for democracy. That will not necessarily always be true, but it is the case today, given its present architecture and the way that people use the network\u0026rdquo; (Harvard\u0026rsquo;s John Palfrey in The Economist). If we are to get beyond \u0026ldquo;duelling anecdotes\u0026rdquo; we also have to give up these sweeping claims about the special nature of the Internet.\nA team centered around George Washington University proposed a framework for analyzing how new and social media affect struggles for political change, breaking down the effects into five separate levels, roughly working outward from the individual:\n individual transformation\n intergroup relations\n collective action\n regime policies\n external attention\n  Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time to do the same on the other side of the \u0026ldquo;internet and society\u0026rdquo; question. Maybe we should stop talking about \u0026ldquo;information and communication technologies\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the Internet\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;new and social media\u0026rdquo; as a single constellation of technologies that have key characteristics in common (distinctively participatory, or distinctively intrusive, for example), and that are sufficiently different from other parts of the world that they need to be talked about separately. The Internet is still pretty new, so we tend to look at it as a definable thing, but digital technologies have now become so multifaceted and so enmeshed in other facets of our lives that such a broad brush obscures more than it reveals.\nSo here is an exploration of what some of the consequences might be, and a rough sketch of how we might break down \u0026ldquo;new and social media\u0026rdquo; into more manageable mouthfuls.\n2. Giving Up \u0026ldquo;New Technology\u0026rdquo; Gerrymandering \u0026ldquo;Social media\u0026rdquo; is often used to mean \u0026ldquo;media on the Internet\u0026rdquo;, but sometimes people extend the meaning to encompass SMS and MMS messaging even though the networks and protocols are different, as when talking about the 2001 ousting of Philippine president Estrada (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;). During the Arab uprisings, \u0026ldquo;social media\u0026rdquo; has been stretched to cover Al Jazeera – a broadcaster – because it draws from YouTube and is commonly accessed over the web in the USA. And Wikileaks is often included in \u0026ldquo;new media\u0026rdquo; even though it released its biggest dump of documents to \u0026ldquo;traditional media\u0026rdquo;. This continual redrawing of the boundaries redefines the category to include whatever is convenient at the time.\nDrawing inappropriate boundaries around \u0026ldquo;new and social media\u0026rdquo; can also exclude essential elements of a story. A week ago a BBC reporter on the radio described how, within days of seizing control of Benghazi, the Libyan opposition had set up a newspaper and two radio stations alongside a web-based radio station (web story). An approach that focuses on \u0026ldquo;new media\u0026rdquo; would have to include the web radio and exclude the other two initiatives, but to do so would misrepresent the message of a sudden flowering of speech. The Internet is just one of many channels, and activists are using all the media at their disposal. Better, perhaps, to avoid drawing the boundary at all.\nForswearing \u0026ldquo;new and social media\u0026rdquo; as a category allows us to include the Benghazi radio stations and newspapers, because they are no longer outside some artificial digital boundary. It frees us up to talk separately and distinctly about blogs, SMS, and Facebook without trying to tie them together in some fake unity: each of these media have distinct architectures, different user bases, different governance models; they serve different purposes, have different interfaces to the rest of the world, and are subject to different commercial pressures.\n3. Computer Networks and Hierarchies A second benefit of giving up the term \u0026ldquo;social media\u0026rdquo; would be to get rid of outdated analogies between the architecture of the Internet and the nature of the activities that take place on it. We\u0026rsquo;ve already seen John Palfrey on that above. Here is a paragraph by Lance Bennett back in 2003:\n   \"The implication here is not that the distributed (multi-hub, or polycentric) structure of the Internet somehow causes contemporary activists to organize in remarkably non-hierarchical, broadly distributed, and flexible networks. Digital media applications can take on a variety of forms, from closed and hierarchical, to open and broadly distributed. Preferences for the latter pattern reflect the social, personal, and political contexts in which many global activists define their mutual relationships\".3    That is, anti-hierarchical activists find an accommodating home on the Internet because its network structure maps to their preferred way of organizing themselves.\nThe shift to Web 2.0 platforms has changed the logical structure of many applications, including the YouTube/Twitter/Facebook trinity,4 to a centralized (single-hub) structure. We continue to speak of networks, but the structure of the human network is no longer mirrored in the structure of the computer communication network. Networks of friends exist only in the cloud of Facebook\u0026rsquo;s servers and SMS messaging has never been carried out on an Internet-style network. There is still much talk of mapping hyperlinks, which form one of the key circulatory systems of the Internet, but the associations of links have been carried over to Facebook friends and to Twitter followers, even though these are beasts of a different sort, living as they do on a single company\u0026rsquo;s private servers.\nThe commercial Web 2.0 platforms that dominate web traffic are quite different from the archetypal open source software communities (in which copies of the source exist in many places) and even from Wikipedia. They cannot be forked, and we do not get to see the source code for the algorithms that drive them. Using \u0026ldquo;Wealth of Networks\u0026rdquo; style logic to discuss how they operate is tempting, but is often inappropriate.\nForswearing \u0026ldquo;new and social media\u0026rdquo; would force us to stop making outdated Web 1.0 analogies and inferences about technological structure leading to social structure, even subconciously, and that would be a good thing. If we make ourselves talk about Facebook in particular, rather than social media in general, then it is clear that issues with their terms of service, privacy policies, real-name policies and so on are not details in the big picture of networked technologies but are central to the potential of Facebook as a tool for effecting political change. Given that there are now more active Facebook users (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) than there were people on the Internet a decade ago (World Bank Development Indicators) this gives those policies their proper level of importance.\n4. Inherent Openness A related benefit would be to get rid of arguments that extrapolate from the inherently open nature of the Internet. It is now over a decade since Lessig\u0026rsquo;s Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, and the ever-increasing sophistication and reach of Internet governance in the form of licenses, regulations, trade laws, and other legal or commercial restrictions are making the end-to-end principle increasingly irrelevant.\nBlog data and some other data is accessible by spidering or subscribing to suitable collections of sites, but with social media the data is privately held, and outsiders must petition to get access to some or all of it.\nForswearing \u0026ldquo;new and social media\u0026rdquo; would force us to drop the empty and misleadingly binary talk of \u0026ldquo;Internet Freedom\u0026rdquo; and acknowledge the sliding scale of rights and freedoms that govern individual transactions in both the digital and non-digital realms. Peter Grant and Chris Wood\u0026rsquo;s unfairly neglected but excellent 2005 book Blockbusters and Trade Wars made it clear that many issues that were supposedly unique to the Internet would be addressed, country by country, by a toolkit of commercial and trade laws, policies and regulations. Their prediction has been proven true over and over again (see also Goldsmith and Wu\u0026rsquo;s Who Controls the Internet), including Google\u0026rsquo;s rephrasing of Internet censorship as a trade barrier.\nBreaking down \u0026ldquo;social and new media\u0026rdquo; into smaller categories would also encourage more discussion of the responsibilities of companies wanting to undertake business around the world, such as presenting terms of service in the language of the country of use (Jillian York points out that Facebook\u0026rsquo;s terms of service are currently available in only seven languages). Given how important privacy is under authoritarian regimes, terms of service matter.\n5. So What Instead? Once we give up on the \u0026ldquo;tendency\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;on average\u0026rdquo; arguments around digital technologies, the Internet takes its place as one part of the real world, not a separate entity. Such a picture is increasingly correct, and the process would repeat for social media a pattern that has already played out in other areas. In the early 1990\u0026rsquo;s there was much talk of a \u0026ldquo;new economics\u0026rdquo; of the Internet, but in the end it turned out that - with a sharpened focus on increasing returns - traditional economics did explain much of the industrial organization of the digital realm. At the same time there was much talk of how the Internet would break down legal barriers, but such barriers have proven surprisingly resilient, and now many Internet cases are argued within the bounds of existing trade, intellectual property, privacy, and other laws. Disputes that seemed to be specific to the digital realm turn out to be (with the exception of net neutrality) about trade law.\nWhat smaller-scale structures would we talk about, if we give up the grand themes of \u0026ldquo;social media\u0026rdquo;? Here is a rough sketch of one division.\nInternet-based social network platforms Centralized, commercial, privately-owned and advertising-driven, the YouTwitFace world is obviously one of the big stories of the moment. The cost structure of such businesses make them natural, if maybe short-lived, monopolies. To be repetitious, the story is not just one about \u0026ldquo;networks\u0026rdquo;; it\u0026rsquo;s also about the terms of service, privacy policies, and advertising policies of the major platform owners. A focus on the Internet has given a tendency to discuss Facebook (the platform)\u0026rsquo;s role in the current ferment independent of Facebook (the company), but that\u0026rsquo;s unsupportable (much more here). What accommodations have the owners made with the countries in which they operate? Mobile Devices Messaging on a phone in the street is different from looking at a browser while sitting inside, especially in times of political turmoil. It is quite possible that the phone could supplement political activity while the desktop browser could displace it. Mobility makes a difference, and lumping SMS messaging together with blogs just confuses things. On the other hand, the proprietary nature of the phone network means that device manufacturers and network operators can be leaned on to comply with state-driven security demands (ask RIM). Blogs Despite Turkey blocking all of blogspot.com, blogging (and especially independent blogging) is architecturally different from social networking platforms. The network of sites is looser, the content more dispersed, the ownership more individual. Blogging plays a different role in political debate and activity to Facebook and other forms of expression. Multi-channel outlets Al Jazeera, The Guardian, The New York Times: major media operations that have adapted to the web now operate as multi-channel outlets. Does it make sense to situate The Guardian as traditional media and put the Huffington Post in the new media category? I don\u0026rsquo;t see why, but these outlets that can operate in multiple media surely demand different treatment. Displaced forms of media The winner-take-all structure of digital markets means that in any one niche there are relatively few players compared to the number in the diminishing-returns-based physical world. There\u0026rsquo;s no need for separate special-topic reference publications when Wikipedia can be expanded indefinitely, and there are fewer bookshops online than there are offline. The major cultural outlets for many countries are increasingly based on the west coast of the USA as Hollywood is joined by Apple, Amazon, and Netflix. We are losing a diversity of institutions in the move to a digital terrain, and it is worth investigating what impact that loss has. Circumvention tools Tools used specifically by activists while carrying out illegal or politically sensitive acts fall into a separate category. Do tools like Tor and the failed Haystack tell us much about social networking and Facebook? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nObviously there are many other divisions possible. My main point is: if there is one shift that forswearing \u0026ldquo;social media\u0026rdquo; would produce, it would be to talk less about networks and self-organization and to talk more about institutions (commercial, state, and global), and this seems to me a realistic shift given how the digital world has changed over the last few years.\n6. Footnotes 1 Caveat: these sweeping claims have not gone away. They are living happily and prosperously in business schools, in popular books, in op-ed pages, and in the halls of Davos. For sophisticated social scientists the utopians are like an embarrassingly loud friend – you know his [sic] faults but you think he\u0026rsquo;s harmless – but to an outside observer you are both members of the same scary mob hanging around at the corner. Sweeping, deterministic ideas still need to be countered, and countered in kind. But for the moment I\u0026rsquo;ll ignore that part of the real world.\n2 You are confusing, he/she is a fence-sitter, I am nuanced.\n3 W.

Time to Stop Talking About Social Media? The debates continue about the role of digital technologies and social media in the Arab/North African uprisings.

Facebook was clearly the big story;\n Facebook owned \u0026ldquo;Fully 42% of the country\u0026rsquo;s Web surfing on January 27, the day before Egypt\u0026rsquo;s main ISPs abruptly severed ties to the Internet.\u0026rdquo; - Threatpost.\n Facebook was explicitly singled out by leading activist Wael Ghonim:\n On 60 Minutes: \u0026ldquo;If there was no social networks, it would have never been sparked. Because the whole thing before the revolution was the most critical thing. Without Facebook, without Twitter, without Google, without YouTube, this would have never happened.\u0026rdquo;\n And: \u0026ldquo;I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and thank him… This revolution started on Facebook.\u0026rdquo;\n  Facebook was where Tunisian and Egyptian activists collaborated (New York Times article).\n Facebook was where the April 6 Movement and the We Are Khaled Said groups formed, (English language versions here and here) which both built and publicised the presence of mass dissent among the urban youth (dissent was already there in some of the labour unions - see Anand Ghopal in Foreign Policy for a survey of the many labour actions over the last few years, including the Mahalla strike that led to the April 6 Movement, and gave it its name).\n  (thanks to Steve Radman for many of these links)\nWhy Facebook? In some countries digital activists are looking for special tools to help them communicate in covert ways, but in Egypt there was enough democratic elbow room for activists in the student and labour movements to organize in public - although not without risks. Perhaps because of this slight openness, online activity seems to have crystallized around the relatively public forum of Facebook. Facebook was permitted, and the educated, urban members of the younger generation adopted it and used it to push up against the limits of acceptable dialog.\n2 Facebook As Generational Space Another reason might be that Facebook is still a generational phenomenon (60% of Egypt\u0026rsquo;s Facebook users are under 25 (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;)). It is an environment where youth feel more at home than the older generation and the authorities, at least for now. And like other generational phenomena, it seems that Facebook plays into a sense of identity for students and youth. Ghonim\u0026rsquo;s comments show that some, at least, feel a sense of ownership of this space: it is theirs, not the older generations.\nGenerational spaces can be both public and private at the same time. The schoolyard is one such space, where (as Iona and Peter Opie documented half a century ago in The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren) a separate culture can persist, out in the open, under the noses of the rest of society.\nOther such generational spaces are less physical. Popular music may qualify at various times. The concerts, gatherings, dress, and attitudes built around it are passed from one teenager to another, while (for the most part) adults are clueless as to what is going on.\nLike popular music and the schoolyard, Facebook is urban, social, and generational and its inhabitants have a strong sense of ownership of \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; space. Could Facebook\u0026rsquo;s role be similar to that of popular music in earlier protests?\n3 Not Since the Sixties… It pains me to say it, really it does. The \u0026ldquo;reminiscent of the 1960\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; cliche has been used to describe every significant protest in the last 40 years that involves more than five people and a street. But the parallels are too many to ignore, and they emphasize the fact that, despite the technology, Egypt is not a fundamentally different \u0026ldquo;Revolution 2.0\u0026rdquo;.\nHere are some quotations from just one short source: Sean O\u0026rsquo;Hagan\u0026rsquo;s essay \u0026ldquo;Everyone to the Barricades\u0026rdquo;, published two years ago in The Guardian.\n   1968 was \"a year in which mass protest erupted across the globe, from Paris to Prague, Mexico City to Madrid, Chicago to London.\"    O\u0026rsquo;Hagan quotes Jon Savage on the role that popular music had in amplifying the feelings of a generation:\n   \"Pop music is always incredibly prescient and you can hear an increasing ambition and invention in the pop music made in those years, a sense of limitless possibility, but also of immense frustration and edginess. And then, in 1968, it all exploded into something totally unforeseen. In the five years from the emergence of the Beatles in 1963 to the upheaval of 1968 the economic enfranchisement of a generation turned into mass political action, if not fantasy.\"    And also this:\n   \"I was completely surprised by 1968,' recalls Francois Cerutti, an old-school Marxist and radical bookstore owner quoted in Kurlansky's book. 'I had an idea of the revolutionary process and it was nothing like this. I saw students building barricades, but these were people who knew nothing of revolution. They were not even political. There was no organisation, no planning.'\"    Here is the sudden outbreak, the viral spread from country to country, the rapid politicization of a generation, the seeming spontaneity of protest, that has been so much discussed in Egypt. Here also is the spread of attitudes through a medium that is public, yet generational - popular music in this case, instead of Facebook. These phenomena have been widely credited to the network nature of the Internet and social media, but the parallels are so clear that it seems unlikely that it\u0026rsquo;s the technological features of the Internet that are making the difference - it\u0026rsquo;s a cultural phenomenon that, in this particular incarnation, is revealed in social media.\nThe same goes for the much-trumpeted leaderless character of the rebellion: in which leaders emerge from the protests, rather than the protests being incited and led by experienced politicians. Here is Paris 1968:\n   \"In just a few weeks, (Daniel) Cohn-Bendit, who was soon to receive a deportation order from the French government for his role in the ferment, had gone from local student activist to an international figurehead for revolution. 'There I was,' he said, 'the leader of a little university, and in three weeks I was famous all over the world as Danny the Red.'\"    And the similarities continue. Here is O\u0026rsquo;Hagan on the international importance of that generation\u0026rsquo;s new technology, television, in spreading ideas and attitudes from country to country.\n   \"We met through television,' Cohn-Bendit later said of his counterparts in other countries. 'We were the first television generation.' Indeed, the radicals had a much better grasp of the galvanising power of television than the politicians they were trying to overthrow. 'A modern revolutionary group headed for the television, not for the factory,' quipped the late Abbie Hoffman, one of the great political pranksters of 1968 who helped provoke a bloody battle between anti-war protesters and the Chicago police force at the Chicago Democratic convention. As the police attacked them, the protesters chanted: 'The whole world is watching!' And, for the first time, it was.\"    Here is Pierre Bourdieu on the importance of television to protesters:\n   \"Successful demonstrations are not necessarily those which mobilize the greatest number of people, but those which attract the greatest interest among journalists. Exaggerating only slightly, one might say that fifty clever folk who can make a successful 'happening' get five minutes on TV, can have as much political effect as half a million demonstrators.\"    Egypt\u0026rsquo;s rebellion, while of course it is unique, is not a new type of rebellion. There are parallels to other rebellions, including the use of cultural space where the ideas and dreams of a generation could be shared in a semi-public fashion, and the use of new media technology to spread the word to a wider public.\n4 Is Egypt a Velvet Revolution? So the Egyptian uprising is not that unique after all. (It\u0026rsquo;s obvious, I hope, that this does nothing to detract from the heroism, creativity, and bravery of those involved). It\u0026rsquo;s not just the student-led riots of 1968; there are similarities to other recent uprisings too, such as the series of \u0026ldquo;Velvet Revolutions\u0026rdquo; that spread through Eastern Europe in 1989. Again, let\u0026rsquo;s just look at one source to see what the parallels are. How about Timothy Garton Ash in the New York Review of Books, December 3, 2009? His essay is titled Velvet Revolution: The Prospects.\nGarton Ash highlights the differences between the \u0026ldquo;velvet revolutions\u0026rdquo; (VR) and earlier revolutions:\n   an ideal type of 1989-style revolution, VR, might be contrasted with an ideal type of 1789-style revolution, as further developed in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and Mao’s Chinese revolution. The 1789 ideal type is violent, utopian, professedly class-based, and characterized by a progressive radicalization, culminating in terror. A revolution is not a dinner party, Mao Zedong famously observed…     The 1989 ideal type, by contrast, is nonviolent, anti-utopian, based not on a single class but on broad social coalitions, and characterized by the application of mass social pressure—”people power”—to bring the current powerholders to negotiate. It culminates not in terror but in compromise. If the totem of 1789-type revolution is the guillotine, that of 1989 is the round table.    Egypt is clearly in the tradition of the velvet revolutions. The social coalition covers labour, student, and religious groups, and the current uneasy phase of negotiation with the armed forces (as opposed to installing a new leader) is characteristic of the type. Like all the \u0026ldquo;velvet revolutions\u0026rdquo;, the Egypt uprising is more of a stand against something (Mubarak; corruption; the unfairness of widespread unemployment and high food prices) than for something. Garton Ash writes that\n   \"François Furet, the historiographer of the French Revolution, doubted if the velvet revolutions of 1989 should properly be called 'revolutions' at all, since they produced 'not a single new idea.'\"    What is happening in Egypt seems more of a rebellion than a revolution (A rebel, as Camus said, is \u0026ldquo;someone who says no\u0026rdquo; (pronoun updated), and this seems to describe the Egyptian protesters.) It has no program beyond the removal of the present system and leadership.\nThe ending of a protest in compromise is also in the tradition of velvet revolutions. Here is Garton Ash again:\n   \"Exit prospects for the ruling elites are critical. Instead of losing their heads on the guillotine, or ending up hanging from lampposts, transition-ready members of an ancien régime, from a president such as F.W. de Klerk all the way down to local apparatchiks and secret policemen, see a bearable, even a rosier future for themselves under a new dispensation.\"    And the Eastern European uprisings were not the first of this type:\n   \"Semantically, the Czechoslovak revolution may have been the first to be called “velvet,” but Central Europe in 1989 did not spirit this model out of the ether. Relevant earlier history includes not just Central Europe’s own learning process through the failed emancipation attempts of 1953 (East Germany), 1956 (Hungary), 1968 (Czechoslovakia), 1970–1971 and 1980–1981 (Poland), but also the mobilization to unseat General Pinochet in Chile, where the 1988 plebiscite preceded Central Europe’s 1989; the toppling of the Marcoses in the Philippines in 1983–1986, which gave us the wonderful Filipino-English term “people power”; and the “revolution of the carnations” in Portugal in 1974–1975, arguably the first “velvet revolution” in postwar Europe; and all the way back to the seminal example of Gandhi in India.\"    So the nature, dynamics and course of the Egyptian uprising has clear precendents. Yes, the activists used Facebook and other tools, because that\u0026rsquo;s where the people are and because that is the medium characteristic of the time and place. But the Internet has not leant a new character to the uprising.\n5 Does it Matter? Does it matter whether Facebook is a cultural event (like pop music) or a technology? Yes it does.\nPopular music and youth culture has always existed in a state of tension between a mainstream, corporate, profit-oriented industry and a more independent avant garde culture. The tension, and the music, needs to be continually renewed, as each generation rejects the mainstream music of its forebears to create new sounds and events of its own.\nIf Facebook is a technology that delivers democracy, then we can trust it: more of it can only lead to more democracy. But if Facebook is a cultural phenomenon, then its meaning and role will change as it becomes mainstream - we need to treat it like we treat the record companies, the mainstream media, and our phone companies. Necessary, but not to be trusted.\nA difference in the case of Egypt is that while major record companies may have been large commercial organizations, there were at least several of them. The tendency of information technologies to lead to monopoly (see Tim Wu\u0026rsquo;s latest book) means that there\u0026rsquo;s only one Facebook, so there is more confusion between Facebook (the place where people meet) and Facebook (the corporation that owns it). But Facebook The Company is a record label, not a musician. It is not surprising to see the poor response of Facebook to the needs of Egyptian protesters:\n   \"Simon Axten, of Facebook's public policy team, said today that the 'real name culture' was an essential element of the social networking platform. However, the policy has also been blamed for making it easy for oppressive regimes to roll up networks of dissidents who use Facebook to communicate.\" - Joe Fay, The Register, Feb 8, 2011. ([](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/08/facebook_real_names/))    Or Alexis Madrigal, \u0026ldquo;The Inside Story of How Facebook Responded to Tunisian Hacks\u0026rdquo;, Jan 24, 2011 in The Atlantic (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;):\n   \"We get requests all the time in a few different contexts where people would like to impersonate someone else. Police wanting to go undercover or human rights activists, say,\" [Facebook's Chief Security Officer Joe] Sullivan said. \"And we, just based on our core mission and core product, don't want to allow that. That's just not what Facebook is. Facebook is a place where people connect with real people in their lives using their real identities.\"    If your needs don\u0026rsquo;t match Facebook\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;core product\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\n6 Social Movements: Loving and Hating the Media The media has always been of central importance for social movements, and activists have always strived to exploit the media of their day in whatever ways they can. At the same time, social movements have never really trusted the media, particularly mainstream media. No one wants to think the mainstream media is on their side. No one trusts it; but everyone looks to it. The relationship between movements and media – particularly mainstream media – has always been fractious and dysfunctional: they need each other, but can\u0026rsquo;t get along together.\nIdentifying with the creative artist while deploring the actions of the major record labels has been a balancing act for music fans and musicions for decades. Popular music is an exploitative, crass and commercialized industry - but it is also an authentic reflection of young people\u0026rsquo;s artistry. Youth love it and are cynical about it, simultaneously.\nSo too television. The one-way, broadcast, non-participatory, corporate medium that digital types love to hate, and yet one that can be actively employed by savvy youth and one that is of obvious importance to social movements.\nPolitical protests are, as Bourdieu argues, almost always symbolic acts. Some few are directly aimed at damaging infrastructure, but most often the intended damage is to the credibility of the opponent. Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s Salt March, Martin Luther King\u0026rsquo;s rallies, the Aldermaston marches, Buddhist monk self-immolation, Provisional IRA hunger strikes, and so on are all symbolic. Even confrontational acts such as the Paris 1968 barricades or the Sandinista raid on the Nicaraguan parliament are more aimed at provoking the public than at crippling the state. And a successful symbolic protest is designed with the medium of the day in mind. It is easy to think \u0026ldquo;without Facebook, how would they publicise their actions?\u0026rdquo; but there are many ways.\nConsider Gandhi (as seen through the lens of a mainstream film, relayed by a friend to me over the phone, and written up on a blog): \u0026ldquo;A defining moment in the movie \u0026ldquo;Gandhi\u0026rdquo; was when Martin Sheen, in the role of an American journalist reports over phone the moral high ground Indians captured in a spectacular display of non-violent resistance at Dharasana Salt Works, May 21, 1930. He yells over phone \u0026ldquo;Whatever moral ascendancy the West held was lost today. India is free – for she has taken all that steel and cruelty can give, and she has neither cringed or retreated.\u0026rdquo; (Link, Wikipedia article about Dharasana Satyagraha)\nSkilled activists design their actions to exploit the media they have at hand, and adapt to new circumstances. A trivial or uninteresting act will attract little attention, no matter what medium conveys it. A dramatic, costly act (see Abbie Hoffmann, above) will provoke interest even through a corporate-controlled, broadcast medium. Demonstrations take place in public squares, not sidestreets. Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s Salt March progressed from town to town so that word of mouth could build support, day by day.\nThe attitude of many activists to the Internet seems to be different. Some not only work with what they have, but also see the medium itself as an inherently progressive tool. Many identify as much with the medium as with the cause, describing themselves as \u0026ldquo;digital activists\u0026rdquo; rather than activists with a particular end in mind. But the Internet is mainstream now, and Facebook is part owned by Goldman Sachs and has an estimated market value twice as big as Monsanto. It is mainstream. It is commercial. It is not on anyone\u0026rsquo;s side but its own, and activists need to remember that. It is time to recover the dysfunctional relationship that activists had always have with the media, including social media.\n7 Reinstating the Dysfunctional Relationship with Media Fortunately, the sound of discontent is becoming more widespread among digital citizens. Here are a few examples that typify the kind of relationship we need to re-establish.\nAdrian Chen, Gawker, \u0026ldquo;Why Facebook Should Do More to Help Egypt’s Protesters\u0026rdquo;, Feb 5, 2011 (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;):\n   Everybody's talking about the massive Facebook groups that helped spark the uprising, but few remember the headaches Facebook has given these groups. Just four months ago, for example, one of the most popular Egyptian Facebook protest groups, _We Are All Khaled Said_, was deactivated abruptly because its administrators had registered their accounts under pseudonyms to protect themselves from the Mubarak regime. After much (virtual) protest, the 300,000-member group was reinstated, and its young members helped form the vanguard of the current uprising.     In many ways, Facebook has made itself actively hostile to those who would organize against a repressive regime or advance an unpopular idea. Most problematic is the policy that bans pseudonyms. Facebook defends the policy by saying their service is about \"real people making real-world connections.\" But what if the real world is full of secret police looking to crack down on dissent, or snooping bosses who might be supportive of a regime? Harvard Internet freedom expert Jillian C York calls the real identity policy \"ludicrously out of touch.\"     And Facebook's notoriously wonky account deactivation system means that activists can find themselves deleted from the site at crucial moments, with little recourse. In 2007, Facebook permanently deactivated the account of the administrator of another important protest group, The April 6 Youth Movement, because its automatic filter thought he was a spammer; he was actually just furiously organizing protests with other members. Many other activists have been muzzled by Facebook's deactivation system, simply for voicing controversial opinions.

This week, you are allowed to close the door but, oops, we changed the terms-of-service. No more closed doors! You had locks last week but we don’t allow them as of this week. Sorry for the misunderstanding.     Every society has “commons” – shared infrastructure that makes it possible for the society as a whole to function. Internet is now a part of that commons in general and many social applications such as Facebook are part of the “social commons.” That is why Facebook, the corporation, is so valuable and people who own it are very rich. It would not be wise of them to ignore that fact.    danah boyd, \u0026ldquo;Facebook is a Utility; Utilities Get Regulated\u0026rdquo;:\n   Yesterday, I ranted about [Facebook and “radical transparency.\"](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html) Lots of people wrote to thank me for saying what I said. And so I looked many of them up. Most were on Facebook. I wrote back to some, asking why they were still on Facebook if they disagreed with where the company was going. The narrative was consistent: they felt as though the needed to be there. For work, for personal reasons, because they got to connect with someone there that they couldn’t connect with elsewhere. Nancy Baym did a phenomenal job of explaining this dynamic in her post on Thursday: [“Why, despite myself, I am not leaving Facebook. Yet.”](http://www.onlinefandom.com/archives/why-despite-myself-i-am-not-leaving-facebook-yet/)    Tunisian activist Sami Ben Gharbia: samibengharbia.com blog post, Sept 17, 2010\n   \"This piece stems thus from a major assumption that the U.S. official and corporate involvement in the Internet Freedom movement is harmful for that same freedom.\"    These are healthy attitudes to have. Activists have always needed to be both in and against the media. Artists have always had a dysfunctional relationship with the industry that manages them. It\u0026rsquo;s time digital activists took on the same dysfunctional relationship with commercial social media companies, and it\u0026rsquo;s good to see that some of them are.\n 8 In Conclusion Facebook, the social networking site, has clearly played an important part in Egypt\u0026rsquo;s protests. But it\u0026rsquo;s played a role as a cultural space for a generation, not as a distinctive technology. If Facebook wasn\u0026rsquo;t there, some other medium may well have played the same cultural role, as has happened in the past (the global rash of student protests in 1968, the velvet revolutions).\nIn the same way that protesters of previous generations used whatever media they had at hand to carry their message, acting both alongside and against the media in many cases, so today\u0026rsquo;s social movements need to both use their advantage with new media, while retaining a healthy scepticism about the commercial nature of the medium itself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine for a generation to feel ownership of their cultural space, in the same way that other generations have felt ownership of popular music. But they need to keep a clear distinction between what it is they like and the corporation that provides it. Just as youth culture has always had a love-hate role with the music industry, so today\u0026rsquo;s youth need to develop a healthy scepticism - make that cynicism - about the owners of their generational space.\nHTML generated by org-mode 7.4 in emacs 23\n","date":1298046570,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4bae65c6a4c3f14d04dced8b82443d7c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/more-egypt-more-facebook/","publishdate":"2011-02-18T16:29:30Z","relpermalink":"/post/more-egypt-more-facebook/","section":"post","summary":"More sceptical, speculative notes on Facebook\u0026rsquo;s role (warning: 4,000 words.

This revolution started online. This revolution started on Facebook. This revolution started in June 2010 when hundreds of thousands of Egyptians started collaborating content. We would post a video on Facebook that would be shared by 60,000 people on their walls within a few hours. I always said that if you want to liberate a society just give them the Internet. If you want to have a free society just give them the Internet.\" ([](http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2011/02/11/exp.ghonim.facebook.thanks.cnn?hpt=T1))    and also: \u0026ldquo;This is the revolution of the youth of the internet, and now the revolution of all Egyptians.\u0026rdquo;\nNarratives matter. We use them to make sense of the world, and we use that understanding to make decisions. Narrative is \u0026ldquo;the simple order that consists in being able to say: \u0026lsquo;When that had happened, then this happened.\u0026rsquo; We like the illusions of this sequence, its acceptable appearance of causality: it has the look of necessity.\u0026rdquo; (Frank Kermode, \u0026ldquo;The Sense of an Ending\u0026rdquo;, p127.)\nSo is the Egyptian rebellion a \u0026ldquo;Facebook Revolution\u0026rdquo;? There are reasons to think the narrative is exaggerated…\nThe easiest people to talk to Most obviously, it is much easier to talk to English speaking participants than non-English speakers. English speakers are far more likely to be part of the one-fifth or so of the country that has access to the Internet. (World Bank Development Indicators). And it is easy to contact people over the Internet, so we hear from people who are on the Internet. It is easy to follow Twitter feeds, so we hear Egyptian tweets.\nThe easiest story to tell It isn\u0026rsquo;t just the sources, though. The Facebook Revolution narrative is an interesting story to tell to a contemporary Western audience. For us, a story built around the familiar yet novel world of Facebook and social media is an easy way into the Egyptian rebellion. How many of us know much about the specifics of Egypt\u0026rsquo;s history, its recent past, or the economic sources of discontent? It is a much quicker and lighter story to say \u0026ldquo;look at the Facebook page.\u0026rdquo; We can even go and look at it ourselves (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;). Talking about strikes is more likely to lose an audience.\nSo every time prominent activist Wael Ghonim is mentioned, he is described as a \u0026ldquo;Google executive Wael Ghonim\u0026rdquo; even though he has explicitly said that \u0026ldquo;Google has nothing to do with this\u0026rdquo; (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;). Do we hear the employer of any of the other leaders? April 6 Movement founders Asmaa Mahfouz, Ahmed Maher and Ahmed Salah are commonly described as \u0026ldquo;activists\u0026rdquo;. It is possible to track down Maher\u0026rsquo;s occupation as a \u0026ldquo;civil engineer\u0026rdquo;, but with no employer. The discrepancy is glaring, and so Google gets to be associated with the uprising, adding to the digital tone of the story.\nUnderreported players As people look back for the roots of the rebellion, the April 6 Movement and the We Are Khaled Said Facebook page have received much of the attention. But there are other strands that fed into the protests. The April 6 Movement was created to commemorate an industrial strike, after all, at a textile factory. There have been more than 3,000 separate labour protests in Egypt since 2004 according to a report by the AFL-CIO. The Kefaya movement is considered by some experts to be a central organizer of the January 25 protests, along with Mohamed ElBaradei\u0026rsquo;s organization (two-minute video with Samer Shehata).\nSelf-Organization? The technological narrative has also been used to describe the rebellion as \u0026ldquo;leaderless\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;self-organizing\u0026rdquo; (see a claim for this by Wikinomics\u0026rsquo; Don Tapscott here, and an illuminating analysis of the question by sociologist Zeynep Tufekci here). Tapscott takes a strong form of the argument: \u0026ldquo;Just as people can self-organize to contribute to Wikipedia, the computer operating system Linux, or the world’s biggest library of video content, they can participate in social change and coalesce into revolutionary movements as never before.\u0026rdquo;\n(Aside: Does anyone else find the language of \u0026ldquo;self-organization\u0026rdquo; insulting to the protesters? It slides too easily into this kind of thing: \u0026ldquo;much in the same way that slime mould coalesces in a forest and moves towards an emergent common \u0026lsquo;goal,\u0026rsquo; so too do simple-message-connected crowds of people coalesce to move towards a common, emergent goal without the overt direction of an explicit leader.\u0026rdquo; So brave protesters are like slime mould? Really?)\nBut of course coordination and leadership is not necessarily going to be obvious to Western eyes. As David Kirkpatrick writes in the New York Times: \u0026ldquo;They are the young professionals, mostly doctors and lawyers, who touched off and then guided the revolt shaking Egypt, members of the Facebook generation who have remained mostly faceless — very deliberately so, given the threat of arrest or abduction by the secret police.\u0026rdquo;\nSome organizing was kept off Facebook on purpose, and so received little attention - like these flyers that Jodi Dean points to. As she says, even Lenin - not exactly known as a networky kind of bloke - agreed that \u0026ldquo;mass movement and \u0026lsquo;professional revolutionaries\u0026rsquo; are not alternative organizational forms. Each is necessary\u0026rdquo;.\nAnother counterpoint to this \u0026ldquo;leaderless protest\u0026rdquo; story is a fascinating Wall-Street Journal article by Charles Levinson and Margaret Croker, who tell a story (The Secret Rally that Sparked an Uprising) about clandestine meetings of small groups of organizers outwitting the efforts of the police to follow what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Of course, getting such a story requires a lot of interviewing and building of confidence.\nBut there is a kernel…\nSo yes, I do think the Facebook Revolution narrative is overstated, and that the Egyptian rebellion marks much less of a break from previous revolts than the language of \u0026ldquo;Revolution 2.0\u0026rdquo; suggests. I agree with this article in TechCrunch (of all places) that \u0026ldquo;People, not Things, are the Tools of Revolution\u0026rdquo;. But there is a kernel of truth there, I do admit. Ghosim\u0026rsquo;s quotation at the top of the page is a clear indicator that some young Egyptians feel a sense of identity with Facebook and the Internet: that it is their generation\u0026rsquo;s culture, not their parents and not the authorities. But that\u0026rsquo;s for another time.\n","date":1297727672,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"18733e692536de5652a7cd172ed2ab20","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/egypts-facebook-revolution-looking-under-the-lamp-post/","publishdate":"2011-02-14T23:54:32Z","relpermalink":"/post/egypts-facebook-revolution-looking-under-the-lamp-post/","section":"post","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;Facebook Revolution\u0026rdquo; narrative of the Egyptian rebellion is everywhere.\nA few examples: Jared Cohen calls digital media an \u0026ldquo;accelerant\u0026rdquo; (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;); Don Tapscott (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) writes that the protests are \u0026ldquo;Enabled by social media\u0026rdquo;; Fox News says that Facebook has \u0026ldquo;Turned Our Entire World Upside Down: Right before our eyes we see Facebook\u0026rsquo;s effects\u0026rdquo; (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;); Micah Sifry writes at CNN that \u0026ldquo;Without the relatively free arena of online social networking sites and tools like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, young Egyptians like Ghonim could not have built the resilient and creative force that finally toppled Hosni Mubarak.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tEgypt's \"Facebook Revolution\": Looking Under the Lamp Post?\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Via Billy Bragg.\n","date":1297413788,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"a1d49da25fb884688d856490d42f316e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/cuts-by-manipulatrix-video-by-diva-schematic/","publishdate":"2011-02-11T08:43:08Z","relpermalink":"/post/cuts-by-manipulatrix-video-by-diva-schematic/","section":"post","summary":"Via Billy Bragg.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\t\"Cuts\" - by Manipulatrix, video by Diva Schematic\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I just read Cosma Shalizi\u0026rsquo;s Must Macroeconomic Theories Have Microfoundations? Like most good scientists, he is obviously partial to reductionism: the idea that you understand a complex thing in terms of its constituent parts. Big things are made of little things, and those little things are simpler and more basic than the big. So he says: \u0026ldquo;Obviously, macroeconomic phenomena are the aggregated (or, if you like, the emergent) consequences of microeconomic interactions. What else could they be? Analogously, the macroscopic physical properties of condensed matter all ultimately emerge from molecular interactions.\u0026rdquo;\nUp until a couple of years ago I would have agreed with Cosma, but now I don\u0026rsquo;t. I am not sure I can articulate why, but let\u0026rsquo;s have a go at it anyway.\nMaterialism and Reductionism\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get a couple of things out of the way. First, I\u0026rsquo;ve not gone all mystical. I\u0026rsquo;m as strict a materialist as anyone. I think I am anyway. But materialism is not the same as reductionism.\nAnd second, I have no problem with reductionism in the physical sciences. I\u0026rsquo;ll happily put my hand on my heart and recite after Dirac that, with the discovery of quantum mechanics \u0026ldquo;the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of … the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble.”\nBut when it comes to social and even biological sciences things are different, and they are different because of evolution and because of people. So I can\u0026rsquo;t agree with psychologists who think the key to understanding human behaviour lies in the neurochemistry of our brains - because where else could it be? - or with reductionist economists believe that \u0026ldquo;in the end\u0026rdquo; the behaviour of society can be explained in terms of the behaviour of the human individuals that comprise it, because what else is society, fundamentally, but a collection of individuals?\nEvolution\nAre evolutionary explanations reductionist? Cosma says yes, but Jon Elster (in Explaining Social Behavior), says no. They provide explanations, but whereas reductionist explanations are also causal (\u0026ldquo;we explain an event by citing its cause. Causes precede their effects in time.\u0026rdquo; [p271]), evolutionary explanations work in terms of consequences. Sure, mutation happens at the microscopic level, but selection is determined by how the mutated organism fits into the bigger world.\nHow to explain the stripes of a zebra? They help their bearer to survive by making it difficult for a predator to pick him or her out from a herd of similarly striped animals. As Richard Dawkins explains beautifully in The Extended Phenotype, we can explain the dam of a beaver as a genetic adaptation to its surroundings. So if a reductionist would say \u0026ldquo;Obviously, animal behaviour (macroscopic) is the consequence of its genetic and cellular makeup (microscopic). What else could it be?\u0026rdquo; you could say \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s the consequence of its environment too.\u0026rdquo; No forests and lakes, no beaver dams.\nNow forests are composed of trees are composed of cells are composed of molecules, so there is a microscopic aspect to the environment too, of course. That\u0026rsquo;s materialism. But which came first, the dam-building genetic mutation or the logs to build with? To privilege one over the other is to miss the whole melody of the explanation. The closer we look, the more we want to know about the genes, but the more we want to know about the environment too: its history, its fluctuations, its other inhabitants. Evolutionary explanations lead outwards as well as inwards, and to me that makes them not reductionist.\nNeurons, shaped by galaxies\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more to social science explanations than evolution.\nMany non-scientists have a reaction against reductionist explanations of human behaviour, as if they somehow diminish us, reducing us to nothing more than a pile of cells. As an ex-scientist myself I have had little sympathy with this attitude, but recently I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself thinking that there is something to it. Not the diminishment part–there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with being a pile of cells–but that it does miss an equally essential part of the puzzle. It may be old hat to you, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s been novel.\nEarlier this year, photons from a star that exploded when the universe was young finally reached NASA\u0026rsquo;s orbiting \u0026ldquo;Swift\u0026rdquo; telescope after an uninterrupted journey of 13.1 billion years, according to the New Scientist. The exploding star was the most distant and hence most ancient object that humans have so far detected.\nWhen the photons collided with the telescope, Swift\u0026rsquo;s signal processing equipment transmitted a record of the event to earth, and \u0026ldquo;within an hour, astronomers began training ground-based telescopes on the same patch of sky to study the burst\u0026rsquo;s infrared afterglow\u0026rdquo;. Soon after, Neil Gehrels of NASA\u0026rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center was giving a press conference, and a few days later Rachel Courtland of the New Scientist spent her day writing up an account of the event, dubbed GRB 090423 (Gamma Ray Burst on April 23, 2009).\nTo say this another way, an explosion that took place 13 billion years ago produced, through a cascade of intermediaries, a change in the movement of certain particles belonging to the 21st century bodies and clothes of astronomers and journalists. To understand, even in principle, the motion of Mr. Gehrel\u0026rsquo;s particles in April 2009 we must take account of photons from an explosion that took place near the beginning of time.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not all.\nIt was only because 21st century astronomers and cosmologists understand the laws of physics that the photon impact was understood to be important and the press conference was held. If 21st-century mathematics and physics (the subjects themselves) did not \u0026ldquo;exist\u0026rdquo; then the motion of Mr. Gehrel\u0026rsquo;s particles would have been different. 21st century mathematics is an abstract thing: it is not made of particles. If the photons had come from a nearer source the results would have been quite different because the implications of those particles\u0026rsquo; frequencies at that time and angle would not have been interesting enough for a press conference.\nThe same goes for the Ms. Courtland\u0026rsquo;s particles. Without the language we use, without a commercial media, an audience for the story, and countless other institutions of society, the neurons in Ms. Courtland\u0026rsquo;s brain would have been firing in quite a different set of patterns on April 27. The motion of the particles that comprise Ms. Courtland and Mr. Gehrel was the result of physics and also the result of culture.\nThe reductionist program seeks to explain personality in terms of neurons, and neurons in terms of molecules, but here the tables are turned. To explain the motion of these atoms, we need to involve the neurons of the Courtland and Gehrel brains, and to explain the activity of those neurons we need to include language, society, and an ancient event from the beginning of time. And there is nothing to say that one of these sequences of causation is more basic or more fundamental than the other.\nYes, we can say that \u0026ldquo;in the end\u0026rdquo; our behaviour is explained by our cells and our cells are explained by our atoms. But that is one perspective among many, and not a privileged one. \u0026ldquo;In the end\u0026rdquo;, the motions of atoms are determined by the properties of our culture and the \u0026ldquo;existence\u0026rdquo; of non-material structures such as mathematics, physics (the body of knowledge), and language.\nDeterminism\nLet me get a bit more romantic. The theoretical physicists, in their search for a theory of everything, claim to be making progress. But every step they take moves us further and further from any notion of a deterministic universe. How? Again, nothing profound or mysterious. If we demand of a deterministic worldview a weak notion of convergence - that the closer we get to the theory, the closer we get to an understanding, even \u0026ldquo;in principle\u0026rdquo;, of the problems it purports to explain. Maybe fundamental physics fails this test.\nHow much of the universe do we need to include in our description to \u0026ldquo;explain\u0026rdquo; a particular event? Hundreds of years ago one could have said that if Ms. Courtland\u0026rsquo;s ancestor had spent her day one way rather than another, we would only have to look in the circumstances of her immediate environment to understand why. But as we humans have discovered more about the universe and our place in it, so our understanding couples us to events that are more and more distant in space and in time, and we need to include more of the universe in any explanation of events. To explain Galileo\u0026rsquo;s actions we needed to include the motion of the solar system. To explain Edmund Halley\u0026rsquo;s actions we need to understand the motion of a distant comet. And so on. And the more of physics we understand, the more of the universe we need to explain the movements of our particles. There are events that took place even earlier than GRB 090423 that have not yet affected the motion of particles on earth, but which will do in the future as we develop ways to detect them.\nThere is no convergence here, and any argument that \u0026ldquo;in the end\u0026rdquo; we are just made up of nuclei and electrons has nothing more fundamental to it that the reverse claim, that the motions of nuclei and electrons are \u0026ldquo;in the end\u0026rdquo; determined by the remainder of the universe, by the properties of abstract cultural constructs such as language and media.\nIndividuality\nYou can make the same reversal for claims that society must be understood in terms of individuals (or macro-economics in terms of micro). There\u0026rsquo;s probably nothing new here for many in the social sciences and humanities, but it\u0026rsquo;s new for me.\nIt is tempting to think that society is composed of individuals because we feel ourselves to be such an individual, with a separate and independent existence. We have stood, each of us, outside on a frost-covered night and looked up at the universe and felt the sense of insignificance in the face of that emptiness. But along with that rush of insight we feel an affirmation of our existence. However small we are, however indifferent the universe may be, we exist. Even if we agree with Samuel Beckett that \u0026ldquo;they give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it\u0026rsquo;s night once more\u0026rdquo;, at least it seems, at such moments, that our light does gleam for that instant.\nA reductionist worldview gives credence to the idea of an isolated, self-contained individual because it sees individuals as the sum of their smaller parts. But this sense of individual, isolated, self-contained wholeness is illusion.\nWhat is a person without language? If we had no language we would not be \u0026ldquo;individuals\u0026rdquo; in the same sense we feel on those nights. A two-year old who stares at the universe feels no awe because they have little sense of self and little understanding of what they are seeing, and our own individuality, our own consciousness, only emerges from that understanding and the culture that produces it. Daniel Dennett quotes Helen Keller on her life before the learned to communicate: \u0026ldquo;Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness… Since I had no power of thought, I did not compare one mental state with another\u0026rdquo;. If consciousness is, as Dennett claims, the \u0026ldquo;centre of narrative gravity\u0026rdquo; - the insubstantial eye in the middle of our storm of experiences and stories, then without language - without culture - there can be no such thing as an individual person. Society may be made of individuals, but individuals are equally made of society.\nAdopting an evolutionary worldview, as opposed to a reductionist one, makes us as individuals simultaneously more and less significant. More significant because our cultural constructs become shapers of the universe no less than the laws of physics that we seek to uncover; less significant because our very individuality is an illusion, contingent on the culture from which we spring.\nUpdate\nCosma Shalizi has updated his post with a response to this one (here), and some interesting links.

Which makes me think I do not get the way that culture works. So maybe you can help me out perhaps? + + + When I read of culture and its changes, mostly I am reading algo-rithmic-ally based thoughts written by the digerati, based on abstract concepts such as filters, networks, and gate-keepers. Coasian transaction costs and read/write culture fill the pages. Yet these concepts miss the very things that Generation X brought to the town of Waterloo for sixteen years of offbeat culture. If you read the digerati you will read of publishers and outlets (video and book and music too) as \u0026quot;gatekeepers\u0026quot; whose job it is to filter out the works that do not make the grade to be considered part of \u0026quot;culture\u0026quot;. Internet-based artists have no need for such an institution; middle-men will fade away as now the artists reach directly to their global audiences. Well, good luck with that if you have neither name nor luck to help you. Yes it's true that clouds can store all yours and mine and everyone's art, yet with no one who curates it it will sit upon its disk drive, left unnoticed by the public. Democratized? I do not think so. + + + \u0026quot;Gatekeeper\u0026quot; just does not capture what it is that independent stores can bring to local landscapes. Certainly it does no justice to the complex role that Gen-X played in Waterloo for years now. Movies are the formal product, but community is there too. When will Netflix organize a zombie walk on uptown streets or sponsor The TriCity Roller Girls (a flat-track roller derby team)? When will iTunes hand out dog treats, welcome pets into the store, or join with next-door coffee shop to raise some money for a goat? Amazon will never help to run a standup festival, or carve a space for LGBT films (and also TV series). Nor will Googlers ever be as cool as staff who know their subject, finding just the film you mean when hazy recollections are the most you can recount about some movie. Concerts, lectures, workshops, protests posted on the notice board, and funky buttons at the counter, next to \u0026quot;Theme of Week\u0026quot; films (where else would you find \u0026quot;The Missing Limb\u0026quot; for that one?) And I'm sure there's more I'm missing. Film enthusiasts, I know, would see it as a place to gather: now where will they meet each other? + + + \u0026quot;Gatekeeper\u0026quot; suggests a barrier keeping out what wants to come in. But the truth is much more friendly; \u0026quot;Gard'ner\u0026quot; is a better title for the independent stores who foster culture in their cities. Tending a community of artists, readers, watchers, fans is more involved than HTML. I was speaking to a drummer in a local indie band, who told me that the music scene still has the big stars (they will always be here) and that there are many smaller acts who find their way to play at bars and clubs; but what is missing is the middle - bands go viral or they wither. In the book world it's the same: the midlist author is the one who finds they can no longer reach a public focused on the moment. Large fixed costs and network effects lend themselves to tournaments where winners take all, most take little. Better hope you win the sweepstakes! It's those modest institutions which it's easy to forget, who bridge the gap from hobbyist to artist, author, movie maker. Here's one fact that makes a difference: Gen X had a point of view, and so do most small institutions. Why? Because their owners give a damn and that's the thing that matters. Algorithms do not capture how a healthy culture functions. Filters cannot yield the richness of the unexpected finding. At its heart, community is what gives art and culture strength to find its feet and make itself heard. Platforms for participation do not make much diff'rence to that. + + + Many here like me will miss our Generation X, but still I understand why owner Mike has said it's time for him to move on. Nothing lasts for ever, does it? Let us hope that there are others who can take another step and start up something new and diff'rent.

A side effect of the WikiLeaks cables is to show that, for all the talk of movements and revolutions, these beliefs are empty of real political content. The cables prompt some tough questions, but the fault lines those questions reveal run perpendicular to digital attitudes, not parallel. When push comes to political shove, open source proponents and so on are found on both sides of the debate. The Internet is a new terrain, but the battles being fought on it are old ones.\nFor example, Open Government advocates are one group having a tough time reacting to the leaks, and their struggles show that the real issues are not the open source/hacker technological questions of openness, access to data, and transparency, but the old political question of “US foreign policy, for or against?”\n“Is WikiLeaks open government?” asks O’Reilly’s Alex Howard, but he doesn’t answer his own question. Tech President’s Nancy Scola writes about “What WikiLeaks Means for ‘Open Government’” and also avoids coming down on for or against WikiLeaks. In typically gnomic fashion, Tim O’Reilly stays firmly on the fence, tweeting that WikiLeaks neither champions nor defies open government, instead it “challenges [open government government 2.0] philosophy. Challenges are good if we rise to them.” Whatever that means.\nOf those who do take a position, some believe that WIkiLeaks is bad for open government (here, here for just two) and others (fewer, from what I can see) that it is good.\nThe internal struggle highlights an emptiness at the heart of the Open Government idea. It is based on the idea that more data available to more people will make government work better, either by improving efficiency and access (Open 311 etc) or by highlighting particular problems (maplight.org and so on), or perhaps both. But while WikiLeaks is making more data available to more people it has no interest in making the US government work better: quite the opposite. As Assange’s writings and this widely linked essay by Aaron Bady make clear, WikiLeaks is using information exposure to put sand in the gears of the US State Department.\nThere is one agreement among Internet/Open Government supporters, which is that the cables highlight excessive government secrecy, and that it shows us that government should be more open to start with. From Australia, Stephen Collins admits that “there’s an uncomfortable feeling in the open government world at the moment,” but goes on to argue that “phe­nom­ena such as Wik­ileaks are a symp­tom, rather than the dis­ease itself. Wik­ileaks exists because of the fail­ure of governments around the world to operate openly enough through­out their his­tory.” Jeff Jarvis makes the same argument, suggesting that nothing in the documents is that bad anyway: “the revelation of these secrets has not been devastating. America’s and Germany’s relationship has not collapsed because one undiplomatic diplomat called Angela Merkel uncreative.”\nBut while there are many cables in the pile that are of no interest to anyone and which seem to be marked as secret for no good reason, to focus on those is to ignore the real revelations that are coming out, day after day. The purpose of the leaks is to derail the American global agenda - if they haven’t succeeded, they will try again.\nThe openness question is always contingent, and to phrase political questions in terms of data is sidestepping the big issue. Your answer to “what data should the government make public?” depends not so much on what you think about data, but what you think about the government. Everyone is in favour of other people’s openness.\nThe same fault lines are appearing around issues such as Amazon and PayPal’s refusal to deal with WikiLeaks. Despite all the talk from the commanding heights of Silicon Valley about the Internet as an enabling technology for dissidents in other countries, especially Iran and China, the enthusiasm for dissent at home is muted. I am a dissident, you are a criminal?\n(If anyone cares, my view is that the leaking of these WikiLeaks cables was a brave act and if it damages US foreign policy in the Middle East and elsewhere, which I think it will, I’m all for it.)\n","date":1291583112,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"6b5bcb93ca792aac20c4a7253ec718d4","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/wikileaks-shines-a-light-on-the-limits-of-techno-politics/","publishdate":"2010-12-05T21:05:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/wikileaks-shines-a-light-on-the-limits-of-techno-politics/","section":"post","summary":"The hacker ethic, open source, open government, radical transparency and mass collaboration: all these ideas are linked by a belief that the Internet will promote non-hierarchical organization, decentralization, “democratization”, openness and sharing.

It\u0026rsquo;s about Facebook, Google, eBay, Apple, and Amazon \u0026ndash; and a bunch of people say he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about.\nGeorge Mason University\u0026rsquo;s Adam Thierer claims that Tim Wu Redefines Monopoly, and accuses Wu of being \u0026ldquo;hell-bent on redefining the English language\u0026rdquo;. TechDirt\u0026rsquo;s Mike Masnick states confidently that \u0026ldquo;domination of a market, by itself, does not create a monopoly\u0026rdquo;, and goes on \u0026ldquo;if we look at the basic definition of a monopoly, you see that it\u0026rsquo;s about having an exclusive situation – being the only seller in the market, or having exclusive control\u0026rdquo;. In BusinessWeek and GigaOm Mathew Ingram picks up the story and declares \u0026ldquo;none of these examples – with the possible exception of Google and search – meets any kind of serious test of the term monopoly\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not clear what Wu even means by saying that Apple has a monopoly on \u0026ldquo;online content delivery.\u0026rdquo;\nBut Wu is right and they are wrong. Monopoly is an economic term and he is writing in the Wall Street Journal, so it\u0026rsquo;s not far-fetched to use the economic definition. And no less a source than Google\u0026rsquo;s own economist Hal Varian defines a monopoly as \u0026ldquo;a situation where a market is dominated by a single seller\u0026rdquo;. Not \u0026ldquo;where there is only one seller\u0026rdquo;. The graduate text \u0026ldquo;The Theory of Industrial Organization\u0026rdquo; by Jean Tirole says that \u0026ldquo;most of the [monopoly] phenomena here could be derived even in the presence of competitors as long as the firm retained some market power. So it\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear that economists use the term the way Wu does.\nI did point this out in the comments to Adam Thierer\u0026rsquo;s piece, and Cato Institute\u0026rsquo;s Jim Harper (or maybe some other Jim Harper?) replied that \u0026ldquo;The stylized version of the word \u0026ldquo;monopoly\u0026rdquo; adopted by some economists is fine for them to use in talking among themselves. In the Wall Street Journal, readers will take it to mean \u0026ldquo;one seller,\u0026rdquo; just like they take \u0026ldquo;monorail\u0026rdquo; to mean \u0026ldquo;one rail\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;monotheism\u0026rdquo; as the belief in one god, etc.\u0026rdquo;\nBut is that how people use the word in everyday life? Let\u0026rsquo;s turn to a couple of tech columnists to see how they use \u0026ldquo;monopoly\u0026rdquo;. Here is one Mike Masnick: \u0026ldquo;In the past, Microsoft used to be willing to admit that unauthorized copies helped the company, as it helped establish its software as a near-monopoly in certain areas, and kept competitors out.\u0026rdquo; Or how about one Mathew Ingram - the one who says \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not clear what Wu even means by saying that Apple has a monopoly\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;-arguing against a suggestion that micropayments can work for newspapers:\nReifman defends his approach by pointing to several successful models of payment for services, including iTunes, text messaging, TiVo, and broadband Internet. The first thing that leaped out at me is that three of those four things — iTunes, text messaging and broadband Internet — are a result of something approaching a monopoly (or an oligopoly or cartel, in the case of text messaging and broadband Internet).

But first, let’s get a few things clear.\nI like transparency in government. I think it’s great that people campaign for a more open government, especially here in Canada. I am impressed with the kinds of things some people manage to achieve by scraping through government data.\nGot that? OK. Now here is what’s wrong with Government 2.0.\n The rhetoric of citizen engagement too often masks a reality of commercialization (last time)\n Information is not always democratizing.\n Information is not always the problem.\n Transparency is an arms race.\n Privacy is the other side of the coin.\n Money flows to Silicon Valley.\n  So, one at a time.\nInformation is not always democratizing\nIn comments on the previous post, Kevin Donovan and Fazal Majid both pointed to this article by Michael Gurstein, who asks “who is in a position to make “effective use” of this newly available data?” and answers himself\n   ‘open data’ empowers those with access to the basic infrastructure and the background knowledge and skills to make use of the data for specific ends. Given in fact, that these above mentioned resources are more likely to be found among those who already overall have access to and the resources for making effective use of digitally available information one could suggest that a primary impact of “open data” may be to further empower and enrich the already empowered and the well provided for rather than those most in need of the benefits of such new developments    It’s worth reading the whole article, and the example of land ownership record digitization in Bangalore, which “allowed the well to do to take the information provided and use that as the basis for instructions to land surveyors and lawyers and others to challenge titles, exploit gaps in title, take advantage of mistakes in documentation, identify opportunities and targets for bribery, among others. They were able to directly translate their enhanced access to the information along with their already available access to capital and professional skills into unequal contests around land titles, court actions, offers of purchase and so on for self-benefit and to further marginalize those already marginalized”\nIn a recent talk, Kentaro Toyama asks his audience (at the 8 minute mark), “You and a poor rural farmer are each given a single e-mail account and asked to raise as much money as you can for a charity of your choice. Who would be able to raise more money?” The answer, of course, is that “you” (like me probably urban, western), because we know wealthy people, we have lots of friends with e-mail accounts, we are literate and have lots of experience writing e-mails, and so on. The technology is identical for each, but the result is different because of the context in which it is being used. The Internet does not democratize. Instead, technology amplifies people’s ability to get things done, and the more ability you start with, the more you get.\nHow would this work with Open Government? How about the \u0026ldquo;Open311\u0026rdquo; services (http://open311.org%2C\u0026amp;sa=D\u0026amp;sntz=1\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNH9aqYCr-1uQTBGzISj5pF-WBW30Q)) which let citizens report non-emergency issues to local government. The archetypal case is potholes that need fixing. If these services come into widespread use, they will be pushed to skew services towards neighbourhoods where people report most frequently (else why implement the service?), which will be the smartphone-owning home-owning better-off neighbourhoods. The better off get better services.\nInformation is not always the problem\nThe pothole reporting case is an example of this too. Round the corner from my house is a very rough patch of street that has been that way for a couple of years. The city knows it’s in bad shape. Why isn’t it being fixed? Because there are other, busier stretches of road that are higher priority. Information is not the problem; resources are the problem. There is no group of city workers sitting round waiting for a call about a pothole so they can go out and fix it.\nIn a different vein, it’s worth reading danah boyd’s talk about unintended consequences of transparency when not accompanied with interpretation. Raw data such as the registered sex offender list certainly counts as “open government” but she retells an expose from The Economist which began\n   with the story of Wendy Whitaker who was arrested in 1996 at the age of 17 for having oral sex with a classmate three weeks shy of his 16th birthday. She was convicted of sodomy against a minor, ended up in jail for a year and is now listed on the registry. \"She sees people whispering, and parents pulling their children indoors when she walks by.\" Not only did she have to pay the price for her teenage indiscretions by going to jail, but she's forced to deal with them day-in and day-out for the rest of her life. Because of the registry. I wish that I could say that Wendy's story was rare, but I hear stories like this over and over again. People's lives ruined because of the registry.    Seeing the problem as one of information can lead us down the wrong path. As boyd says:\n   In focusing on the first step – transparency or access – it’s easy to forget the bigger picture. Internet access does not automagically create an informed citizenry. Likewise, transparent data doesn’t make an informed citizenry. Transparency is only the first step. And when we treat transparency as an end in itself, we can create all sorts of unintended consequences.    Transparency is an arms race\nThe Open Government initiatives are getting lots of information out into the public that wasn’t effectively public before. That’s good. But now that the information about, say, voting behaviour and donations is open there is a clear incentive for donors and donation recipients to muddy the waters. Intermediaries will appear. Money will be exchanged not as donation but in some other form. I’m sure there are endless ways of working the system, now it needs to be worked. Systems respond to changes, and in this case a move to transparency will be met by a move to obfuscation.\nPrivacy is the other side of the coin\nThere is one essay in the Open Government collection (by Jeff Jonas and Jim Harper) that addresses privacy concerns. Once data is targeted to be made public, it becomesimportant that improper or inappropriate data not be bandied about. So they recommend such strategies as limiting backups (!), destroying old data, “minimal disclosure in transfer between projects” (which goes counter to the Gov 2.0 direction) and more. It’s almost like the arms race, except instead of mischievously hiding data that could harm yourself, IT professionals are dutifully hiding and destroying data that could harm others.\nData anonymization and aggregation are often cited as ways of handling these issues, but recent developments in “re-identification” have shown that such efforts may be doomed. The identification of individuals within the Netflix Prize data set (paper) led to the cancellation of the second Netflix contest, and has cast a chill on crowdsourcing contests. Legal scholar Paul Ohm’s recent long but highly readable paper on Broken Promises of Privacy suggests that we need to re-assess the basis for many of our data privacy laws because information previously thought to be anonymous has now got to be treated as potentially privacy-damaging.\nBill Schrier, CTO for the City of Seattle, addresses privacy in an essay in the Open Government collection. As just one example, many elected officials maintain lists of email addresses for use in contacting constituents, and these lists are a common target for public disclosure requests. It is difficult to prevent misuse of these lists for spam emails and other inappropriate uses. Open Government is good, but receiving penis or breast-enlargement emails as a result of emailing your councillor? Not so much. Other examples he has come across include a chilling effect on grievances because complaint investigations are public records, and the city being forced to provide a complete list of full legal names and dates of birth to a local radio station, “two of the three pieces of information needed to steal employee identities”. Schrier is an open government advocate, but making this data public is “not a trivial or inexpensive task” if it is to be done with care. As he asks, “most of [the problems] can be overcome. But do we really want to make it that easy for everyone to obtain and use that data?”\nMoney flows to Silicon Valley\nI’m not quite sure how to articulate this final point, but as I haven’t seen it elsewhere I’ll give it a go. Let’s take an example. Google and the City of San Francisco developed a format the General Transit Feed Specification, which “defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information.” Using this, cities can push their transit schedules to Google for publication on Google Maps.\nUseful, for sure. I love to be able to plan trips and Google Maps is a convenient way to do it. But there is a downside, which is that a purely local transaction, of me planning a bus trip in my home city, now involves sending money (via advertising) to California. The winner-take-all nature of the Web means that an increasing number of apparently local exchanges are done via California, such as personal ads via Craigslist. Is that a good thing for the local economy? How would we feel if it weren’t Google but a Chinese company that got the information and the money along with it?\nSo am I opposed to Open Government? No, but I’m far from convinced that the digital approach to the problem will actually lead to an increase in openness.\n","date":1289947068,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"3fdacf78ced0ea152faf1f2edba0f22f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/what-else-is-wrong-with-government-20/","publishdate":"2010-11-16T22:37:48Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-else-is-wrong-with-government-20/","section":"post","summary":"There were some lively comments on my previous post, which was really only half-finished, so I’m going to write the other half here.

Leading light Tim O’Reilly describes it as “government as platform”. The idea is that open data - provided in such a way that programmers can write software to read it, analyze it, and transform it - increases transparency and promotes innovation.\nGovernment 2.0 is on a roll. It got a big boost in the US from Barack Obama’s early memo on transparency and open government, and the setting up of the data.gov website. In the UK there is data.gov.uk and David Cameron’s “Big Society” initiative. Even Canada’s notoriously secretive government is consulting about it and many cities have opened up data feeds. And there are other initiatives around the world. Sounds great? Well yes and no.\n2.0 Agendas\nThe rhetoric of Government 2.0 draws heavily from efforts by private citizens and non-profit groups to make government more accountable. It has a civil liberties flavour, with talk of citizen engagement and of citizens’ rights (“giving citizens access to data that is theirs”), participatory society, collaborative democracy, transparency, and so on. Take the new collection of essays Open Government. The examples of Government 2.0 initiatives almost all deal with citizen access to the US government’s inner workings: campaign contributions, lobbying data, congressional votes, legislative proceedings, federal government contracts and spending, court proceedings. It describes efforts by non-commercial groups such as opensecrets.org, maplight.org, followthemoney.org, govtrack.us and so on to use this data to enforce greater accountability. This is all fine and good - although proponents should recognize that this access to information is one step in an arms race and that those who want to hide information will now look for ways to do so.\nBut the “Open Government” project has a second agenda: it demands that data be made open not only to citizens, but also to private companies. The recent Gov 2.0 Summit and Gov 2.0 Expo, also organized by O’Reilly Media, are big Washington events sponsored by major technology companies. It is clear that there is money to be made in Government 2.0 - money that is mentioned very sparingly in the Open Government book.\nParticipation or privatization?\nShould we care if private companies get our data for free? After all, maps and weather have already been made available, and innovative commercial applications such as Google Maps have made it useful to the public. Many Government 2.0 enthusiasts see commercial opportunities complementing non-commercial activities. Tim O’Reilly writes, “The whole point of government as a platform is to encourage the private sector to build applications that government didn’t consider or doesn’t have the resources to create. Open data is a powerful way to enable the private sector to do just that.”\nThere’s another name for outsourcing government services to private industry, and that’s privatization. Talking of “a dramatic redistribution of power from elites in Whitehall to the man and woman on the street”, as David Cameron did, is a lot like the Margaret Thatcher line that selling off nationalized industries was restoring them to the people. As Ed Miliband says, “for all the talk of a big society, what is actually on the way is cuts and the abandonment of community projects across Britain.” O’Reilly is very close to supporting the Big Society program (he praises it in a recent tweet) and says that “In some sense, government hitting the wall on deficits is a good thing, if it forces a real reboot,“ which is not only callous, but uncomfortably close to Naomi Klein’s “Shock Doctrine” thesis. You have to wonder, is this what the civil libertarians who have been pulled into the Gov 2.0 effort really want? Some of them need to think a little harder before following Tim O’Reilly’s tune.\nThe problems with profit\nMany of the heavy hitters in Silicon Valley believe in “social entrepreneurship”, in the belief that they represent an enlightened, humane, and smart capitalism. But money has a way of corrupting. The story of microcredit has lessons that Government 2.0 promoters could learn from.\nMohammed Yunus won a Nobel Prize for founding the non-profit Grameen Bank that extended “microcredit” loans to groups of poor people, with very encouraging results. When Pierre Omidyar, the eBay billionaire, got involved in microfinance he decided that the “non-profit” part of the story was a limitation. As the New Yorker’s Connie Bruck reported a few years ago: “Yunus is now seen by Omidyar and many others as the archetypal founder, too wedded to his original vision. In recent years, younger and nimbler players have been taking microfinance—their preferred term—toward the idea of building a fully commercial, profit-making sector. This conflict, between pure do-gooders and profit-minded do-gooders, has come to define the current debate in the microfinance world.”\nUnfortunately it has not turned out so well. Yunus’s worry that profit-oriented companies were “pushing microfinance in the loansharking direction” has been born out. This year’s IPO by SKS Microfinance, a for-profit company active in India, made tens of millions for some of its board members, as well as for board members of Seattle-based nonprofit Unitus, which has invested in SKS. Meanwhile, the loans from these commercial microfinanciers have become “death traps”, and after seventeen SKS clients in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh committed suicide the clamour for answers about the role of profit has become louder. There are real differences between profit-seeking and not-for-profit groups, and they must be kept in mind.\nA step forward\nThere are other issues with Government 2.0 that I may come back to later, but let’s wrap this up. Glossing over the difference between companies and citizens obscures key issues at the heart of Government 2.0 and risks corrupting the whole enterprise. Fortunately, there is a solution. When government puts its data into the open, it does so with a license attached to it. In most cases this license permits both non-commercial and commercial use of the data, so long as the source is acknowledged. It’s time to consider licensing the data for non-commercial use only, and having a separate license for commercial users. Perhaps permitting some limited commercial use for free, but charging for more extensive use, would be a first step to protecting our data from the temptations of profit.\nUpdate: Part two is here.\n","date":1289692152,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"36da9c013d527a7277fbc6904e069ac2","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/what-is-wrong-with-government-20/","publishdate":"2010-11-13T23:49:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-is-wrong-with-government-20/","section":"post","summary":"- why open data needs a non-commercial-use license, and the lessons of microcredit.\n“Government 2.0” is the initiative to make government data open to the public using Web-based technologies.

Some of her rescuers were far away in the USA: as soon as the earthquake struck, a group of American volunteers put together a web site using Ushahidi, the Kenyan-created “crisis mapping” software, and together with expatriate Haitians started to turn text messages and tweets into points on a map that could be shared with aid workers. In doing so, they “found themselves center stage in an urgent effort to save lives during one of the largest relief operations in history” [5], and helped to save the seven-year-old.\nMacrowikinomics presents Ushahidi a “new paradigm for humanitarian efforts” that\n   turns much of the conventional wisdom upside down. Rather than sit idly by waiting for help, victims supply on-the-ground data using cell phones or whatever communication channels are open to them. Rather than simply donate money, a self-organized network of volunteers triages this data, translating and authenticating text messages and plotting incidents on interactive mapping displays that help aid workers target their response” [6].    The “Mass-collaboration” approach is a contrast to “the old crisis management paradigm” in which “big institutions and aid workers parachute into a crisis, assess the situation, and dispense aid with the limited information they have” [6].\nIt is admirable that volunteers would put so much effort into helping people in crisis, and it is good that this software enabled them to make a contribution. But is Ushahidi “a new paradigm” for urgent relief operations? Does it really change idle victims and passive donors into active participants? And how much of a contribution did it really make to dealing with the Haiti earthquake? I want to spend a whole post on these questions because the story sets the tone for the whole book.\nIs Information the Bottleneck?\nIn a fine talk posted on YouTube just today, IT researcher Kentaro Toyama talks of the Five Myths of Information Technologies for International Development. One of these myths is that “Information is the Bottleneck”.\nToyama asks his audience why they are not richer, more educated, and more compassionate than they are, given that they would like to be and that the information needed to become so is available to them (eg, MIT’s Open Courseware)? The answer he gives is that information is not bottleneck to achieving any of these goals. It’s a theme I have touched on before in the context of digital activism and which will come up again in these posts, and it applies to crisis response too.\nIn crisis situations, and in aid operations more generally, information may not be the main problem. As Toyama says on his blog, the Ushahidi effort is two distinct things: (1) the technology platform and (2) the individuals who built and use it, and who are dedicated to helping.\n   “Much of the excess hype around Ushahidi comes from people who think that (1) is the secret sauce, and that it offers a new hope for development. But, actually, it’s (2) that makes Ushahidi great, and it’s not particularly new. ... for aid purposes, even (1) and (2) only go so far, because (3) is missing. And, what’s (3)? (3) is human/institutional intent and capacity on the ground. As wonderful as Ushahidi (1)+(2) is, it makes no difference if there isn’t (3), a force on the ground that can actually respond meaningfully to the noisy information (1)+(2) produces. In the case of Haiti, response teams were already overwhelmed. Additional information, per se, was only adding to the unread mail.”    And here is my favourite book on international aid, Elizabeth Pisani’s The Wisdom of Whores, on information as it affected the AIDS effort:\n   “We were collecting more and more really good information, and then not acting on it. Two things were getting in the way - ideology and money. In the AIDS industry, we have too much of both.” [11]    Ushahidi in Haiti\nI can find only a few public attempts to evaluate the Ushahidi effort in Haiti. One is a 16-pagereport published in September by the United States Institute for Peace, an organization that donated to the effort. It describes some of the contributions that Ushahidi effort made, but presents little in the way of evaluation or analysis. A set of thoughtful reflections by Jaro Valuchi is posted atpakreport.org. A reflection by audiencescapes is doubtful of the impact of Ushahidi and of crowdsourcing:\n   Despite the enthusiasm surrounding mobile communications, they have real limitations in an environment such as Haiti where most households lack access to the electrical grid and the mobile subscription rate is less than 45 percent. Even Thompson-Reuters, which launched a service that allowed survivors of Haiti's earthquake to receive critical information by text message directly to their phones, free of charge, only had 24,000 people register.     This is a recognized limitation even by the resource’s proponents. Where the tool draws its strength is in its ability to provide “real-time” information. Ushahidi’s answer to critics of crowdsourcing’s lack of verifiability is [SwiftRiver](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fswift.ushahidi.com%2F\u0026sa=D\u0026sntz=1\u0026usg=AFQjCNFUFEMM_Knxf2vvHi_dd7TczwnsHA), a new open source software platform that acts as a verifying filter that sifts through information through the multiplicity of channels that feeds crowdsourcing. However, the platform has only just recently been made available to the public, so it too is somewhat untested.     The question of how useful Ushahidi was during the crisis in Haiti for the most part remains unanswered.    Another is a pair of articles by Paul Currion, an IT specialist who runs a consultancy for humanitarian operations. Hestudied the roughly 3,000 messages that came in to the Ushahidi effort over the 4646 shortcode that was set up for the purpose and his efforts resulted in frustration:\n   In the end, I was reduced to bouncing around the Ushahidi map, zooming in and out on individual reports – not something I would have time to do if I was actually in the field. Harsh as it sounds, my conclusion was that the data that crowdsourcing of this type is capable of collecting in a large-scale disaster response is operationally useless...     Disaster response on the scale of the Haiti earthquake or the Pakistan floods is not simply a question of aggregating individual experiences. Anecdotes about children being pulled from rubble by Search and Rescue teams [such as that told on the first page of Macrowikinomics - ed] are heart-warming and may help raise money for aid agencies but such stories are relatively incidental when the humanitarian need is clean water for 1 million people living in that rubble. Crowdsourced information – that is, information voluntarily submitted in an open call to the public – will not ever provide the sort of detail that aid agencies need to procure and supply essential services to entire populations.     That doesn't mean that crowdsourcing is useless: based on the evidence from Haiti, Ushahidi did contribute to Search and Rescue (SAR). The reason for that is because SAR requires the receipt of a specific request for a specific service at a specific location to be delivered by a specific provider – the opposite of crowdsourcing. SAR is far from being a core component of most humanitarian responses, and benefits from a chain of command that makes responding much simpler. Since that same chain of command does not exist in the wider humanitarian community, ensuring any response to an individual 4636 message is almost impossible.    Currion asks “could crowdsourcing add value to humanitarian efforts?” and answers himself:\n   Perhaps it could. However, the problem is that nobody who is promoting crowdsourcing currently has presented convincing arguments for that added value. To the extent that it's a crowdsourcing tool, Ushahidi is not useful; to the extent that it's useful, Ushahidi is not a crowdsourcing tool.    The article provoked some useful discussion (a critical response from Robert Munro, who was part of the text message processing effort, ishere) and afollow-up from Currion, in which he concludes:\n   there’s a lot of grandiose yet vague promises that crowdsourcing will revolutionise humanitarian response, and I think we need more than vague promises. Misinformed reporting plays a role in my frustration, but nobody seems to be interested in correcting that misinformation – and when people persist in claiming that their tool will revolutionise the sector based on no evidence, I get suspicious.     When I was writing the article, I could only judge whether crowdsourcing added value based on the evidence that was available to me – just like everybody else. If presented with new evidence (perhaps an expanded dataset or actual testimonials), I’m prepared to change my opinions – but nobody has presented any such evidence, and we just get repeated anecdotes about how the director of FEMA really liked the Ushahidi map. In particular I asked whether anybody had a clear use case scenario, but none has been forthcoming.    Those on the inside also recognize that Ushahidi is a complementary tool to other efforts rather than “a new paradigm”. Chris Blow, “one of the longest serving community members”,makes the point that “Systems like Ushahidi have turned enormous communication barriers into a trivial installation and training process. But there is a whole other 90% of real work”.\nIn other words, Ushahidi and other software projects are one more way that people with a particular set of skills can contribute to disaster relief, but they are no more (and no less) valuable than many other efforts that don’t get attention from high-profile media and books. In a theme that will be repeated throughout this review, the closer you look at examples of Internet-based collaboration, the more they look like a new medium for realizing old (and often admirable) commitments. There is no paradigmatic shift separating Oxfam and Ushahidi.\nClay Shirky also highlights Ushahidi’s impact on reporting electoral violence in several places in his recent book Cognitive Surplus, and again makes the comparison between the information Ushahidi provides and that of the mainstream media, suggesting a fault line between old ways of doing things and the promises of the new technology. But the comparison is again misleading. Mainstream media has never been the way that those on the ground get their information about politically charged events. Information about human rights abuses in Central America during the 1980’s spread throughout North America via networks of solidarity groups, small independent publications, and courageous individuals who went to record what was happening and came back with their reports. Is our collective understanding of violence in Congo today better than that of El Salvador 30 years ago? Not noticeably. The dividing line between activists and mainstream media is not erased by the Internet world.\nTurf wars\nOne of the benefits of self-organized mass collaboration, according to Macrowikinomics, is that crowdsourcing avoids the inter-organizational turf wars that plague old-style aid institutions. The authors are damning of the old ways of doing things, claiming that the top-down approach leads to “poor decision making, redundancy, and confusion, and often to wasted money and wasted opportunities. To make matters worse, the end recipients of disaster relief are almost always treated as helpless victims and passive consumers of other people’s charitiy.” [6] Harsh words, and ones that many grass-roots aid organizations involved in Haiti may argue with.\nBut does the digital paradigm avoid these problems? The answer is no.\nUshahidi plotted incidents and reports on maps of Haiti, but getting realistic maps of post-earthquake Haiti was far from simple. Ushahidi relied on the work of volunteers from OpenStreetMap (OSM), a remarkable effort to build “a free editable map of the whole world” using volunteer contributions. OpenStreetMap was not the only effort to map Haiti during the crisis; other teams were using Google MapMaker. It would have been better if the two efforts could have been combined to avoid wasteful duplication, but that was not possible, at least in the crucial early days,despite good intentions. The problem waslicensing. As a Google representativeexplained on a forum:\nWe have previously sponsored OSM\u0026rsquo;s efforts and explored with them how to work together. A sticking point in these past discussions has been OSM\u0026rsquo;s share-alike license clause, according to which any data we combine with their data set must be shared back to OSM. Since we routinely combine proprietary 3rd party and user-contributed data sets on Google Maps in order to create the world\u0026rsquo;s richest base map, we cannot share these combined data sets back to OSM.\nEfforts by the Open Geospatial Consortium helped to resolve some of the duplication, but blogger Matt Ballconcluded that “While all these efforts were helpful, clearly more work needs to be done for greater coordination and easier portability of data between different platforms and different creators and users of the data.” So turf wars, in the form of data licenses, complicated the digital activists efforts just as they complicate the work of other aid groups.\nConclusion\nThe lesson here is not that Ushahidi is a failure or a waste of time. But the evidence so far shows that it is a valuable but small contribution to the daunting task of disaster relief. New technology can help humanitarian operations, but it needs to be seen as a complement to existing work, not “a new paradigm for humanitarian efforts”. The difference between digital “self-organization” and the aging institutions criticized throughout Macrowikinomics is not so big - both are plagued by issues such as legal contracts, confusion, contradictory commitments, and even rivalries. People are people, whether they interact digitally or face to face. In the end, it’s people on the ground that matter the most, and governments, large NGO’s and experienced staff - for all their clumsiness and bureaucracy - will continue to be central to crisis relief efforts.\nThe Ushahidi effort in Haiti points to one of the central problems with MacroWikinomics: if information is not the problem, then information is not the solution. Viewing the world through a technology-centric, information-centric lens leads us down the wrong path as we try to diagnose the ills of society and to build a better world.\n","date":1289519151,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0a9a7e70001f931926fdd4d95e7687ad","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/macrowikinomics-2-ushahidi-and-information-as-bottleneck/","publishdate":"2010-11-11T23:45:51Z","relpermalink":"/post/macrowikinomics-2-ushahidi-and-information-as-bottleneck/","section":"post","summary":"Macrowikinomics opens with the rescue of a young Haitian girl after the earthquake of January 2010.

Williams. This post is a broad statement of what I think of the book: subsequent posts will look at particular case studies. Numbers in [square brackets] are page numbers in the book.\nThe Internet is a new terrain on which old conflicts of class, gender, wealth and power are being played out, and it’s not clear which contestants this new battleground favours.\nThat’s not how Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams see things. In Macrowikinomics, their follow-up to the hugely successful Wikinomics, they portray the Internet itself as a revolutionary force for change, carrying us to a radically different future. To them, society has a new set of fault lines and they are technological rather than political or economic. They divide the failing, decaying institutions of a bygone age (musty, industrial, closed, and hierarchical) from the blooming organic forms of the digital world (dynamic, self-organized, collaborative, open, and democratic). It’s get on board or be left behind. In this way the book is at right angles to reality. I don\u0026rsquo;t completely oppose what they say, I just think the fault lines that matter run along a different direction.\nTapscott and Williams value things that matter to many people, myself included. They value voluntary collaboration and sharing, openness and integrity in politics and business, and democracy in the sense of people having a say in the shape of their society. They seek ways to extend civic engagement, promote volunteer action, and encourage “global governance from the ground up” [302]. Their attitudes to egalitarianism are probably different from mine, but in terms of what constitutes a fair society we have some things in common. So it is unfortunate that I disagree with them deeply. Yet disagree I do, and these posts must be a largely negative commentary on their book.\nYou can see the root of my disagreement, plain as day, on the book jacket, where six of the seven blurbs are from CEO’s of major companies. Appealing to these elite voices contradicts the message of the book, which is that we need to abandon hierarchy and move to a more democratic “age of networked intelligence” [24]. The contradiction continues inside, where the book adopts a consistently populist tone, arguing against “the cult of the policy expert” [270], with sentences like this sprinkled liberally throughout.\n   The closed, hierarchical, and static regulatory structures of today must give way to new processes that embody values of openness, empowerment, inclusiveness, and knowledge sharing. [294]    Then a few pages later they enthusiastically claim that “the Global Agenda Partnership shows a way forward”[307] for global governance. What is this Partnership? It is an initiative of the organization that hosts the Davos summits, the exclusive, by-invitation-only annual gathering of the world’s richest and most influential. If the Davos attendees are not elite, I don’t know who is.\nI suspect that Tapscott and Williams do not see this juxtaposition of billionaires and populism as contradictory. After all, if the crisis is one of vision, inspiration, and having the courage to take the digital plunge then anyone can lead that transformation, be they CEO or student or social worker. The new revolutionaries and the defenders of the old order are distinguished by attitude and aptitude, not by class and gender. Some are prepared to bet on the new technologies of participation and some have closed minds, remaining tied to outdated business models.\nI can’t agree. Macrowikinomics sees the world through the lens of technological determinism, and it is a distorting lens. It sees the technology of the Internet as unleashing change on society, but is blind to the ways that society has changed the Internet and the ways in which, as the digital world has gone mainstream, it has increasingly taken on the characteristics of mainstream culture.\nOn one side, Macrowikinomics exaggerates the political and economic possibilities of digital collaboration as well as the discontinuity between today’s digital culture and the activities of previous generations. On the other side, it ignores the unsavoury possibilities that seem to accompany each and every inspiring initiative on the Internet (every technology has its spam) and inspirational initiatives for change that take place away from the digital world. Most importantly, it does not register the corrosive effect of money (and particularly large amounts of money) on the social production and voluntary networked activity that they are so taken with.\nBu do these distortions matter? Macrowikinomics is primarily a call to action. The program of the book is to relay stories about inspirational Internet-based initiatives, often based on conversations with the leaders of those initiatives. You will find few nay-sayers in these pages, and most often we must take the cast of characters at their own evaluation. The description of the Huffington Post, for example, is taken almost entirely from statements by Huffington herself and by admirers. I don’t mind that: who would want every book to be a cautious and balanced, analytical tract? The authors have an explicit agenda, and they are committed to making their case for a shift to digital collaboration. And so long as they are calling for people to use the possibilities of the Internet for good, isn’t that what matters?\nUnfortunately no, because the unrealistically sunny pictures of digital culture painted in Macrowikinomics will lead idealistic people to misdirect their talents and energy. The book promotes many forms of digital activity as contributions to positive social change when the reality may be that they are making little difference, or even doing the opposite, perhaps transferring money from local communities to the pockets of Silicon Valley billionaires. A corrective set of lenses is needed, and that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ll try to provide in these posts.\nThere is a danger that I’ll come across as an anti-Internet malcontent. But digital curmudgeons such as Andrew Keen tend to agree with many digital utopians that the Internet is forcing a change in the balance of power in society: the difference is that they are repelled by the change rather than entranced by it. Myself, I disagree that the balance has shifted very much at all. We live an increasing portion of our lives digitally, but the struggles we face remain the same and the major sources of conflict in society are unchanged. There are many inspiring digital initiatives and experiments carried out by admirable people, but it’s the people who are inspiring, and the technology is more often than not secondary. The Internet simply happens to be the natural terrain for today’s activists, because that’s where the people are.\n","date":1289134943,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"6ef4f3a07535a7053692a232a39967d4","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/macrowikinomics-i-generalities/","publishdate":"2010-11-07T13:02:23Z","relpermalink":"/post/macrowikinomics-i-generalities/","section":"post","summary":"This is the first of a several-part series of posts on the new book Macrowikinomics, by Don Tapscott and Anthony D.

Now that half a billion of us are Facebook users, how do we think about the Web 2.0 phenomenon? Do we think of it as the friendly publican who provides a place for us to talk, or as a dynamic and fascinating landscape to move in, or as the provider of a necessary service like our ISP or cable company? Turns out it's more of the latter. We use Facebook despite, not because of, our relationship to the company. Here is Tossell.  Last week, the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a venerable consumer survey, for the first time published findings on consumer satisfaction with social networks. Facebook scored remarkably poorly, squeaking in at the bottom of the category, just ahead of MySpace, which is about as pleasant as a monster-truck rally.     “This puts Facebook in the bottom 5 per cent of all measured private-sector companies, and in the same range as airlines and cable companies, two perennially low-scoring industries with terrible customer satisfaction,” reported the ACSI.     Airlines and cable companies!     This doesn’t square with the mythologies that have grown around social networks, which usually tell us that these websites have personality-altering, life-changing properties that transform formerly mild-mannered citizens into hyperconnected life-sharers. Right now, Facebook is trying to turn this milestone into a public-relations exercise about the stories of transformation that Facebook has brought about.     This misses the point. The simple fact is that – like an airline or a cable company – Facebook is useful.    The survey is also written about at PC Mag.\nAlso in today\u0026rsquo;s Globe, an interview with chief Wikifiddler Sue Gardner. While I\u0026rsquo;m generally a Web 2.0 curmudgeon I do like Wikipedia a lot, and Gardner brings out what\u0026rsquo;s best about it. It has stayed non-commercial, and that has been the key to its success and to the loyalty of those who contribute to it. It\u0026rsquo;s non-commercial nature also makes it something of a rarity. I particularly like this:\n“Wikipedia is like the National Parks Service. The Internet is a vast space and it will only continue to grow, but in the vastness you still need space for parks or public libraries.” One issue that concerns Gardner is the non-representative nature of Wikifiddlers:\nAlso challenging Wikipedia-as-democratic-paradise is the fact that 87 per cent of Wikipedians are male (the average is a 25-year-old engineering student). Most come from affluent countries that afford them the technology and leisure time to sit computer-side, without pay.    Ms. Gardner’s goal is to correct that imbalance: “My vision for Wikipedia is for it to be the sum of all the world’s knowledge,” she says simply, taking a sip of her Fresca. “To do that, I want more women, more older people, more people from Africa!”    Where are the women? It turns out that a lot of them are working at commercial content farms. These fast-food (ehow.com, about.com, and so on) pay people to provide material that they can then use to sell ads. The last six months has seen a flurry of interest in these outfits, who churn out thousands of articles a day to collect Google search results. A survey of articles is here. The revelation that Google\u0026rsquo;s latest Search Stories video inadvertently shows how ubiquitous they have become is at TechCrunch.\nA \u0026ldquo;day in the life\u0026rdquo; piece by a Andria Krewson, a contributor to one of these farms, explains how they work. She makes the point that \u0026ldquo;Demand Media doesn\u0026rsquo;t need help with public relations from me. They\u0026rsquo;re compiling comments in an internal forum from their writers about why they love Demand Studios. And plenty of people have commented. They appear to be overwhelmingly women, often with children, often English majors or journalism students, looking for a way to do what they love and make a little money at it.\u0026rdquo; Unlike Wikipedia of course. Still, I agree with the popular take that Demand Media and its competitors are a Bad Thing.

Sociologists and cultural theorists talk of ideology, identity, hegemony and discourse; economists deal in rational choice, individual tastes, incentives and the mathematics of game theory. Sociologists suggest that society shapes the individual; economists that individual traits shape society. Many economists come from a right-wing and market-friendly outlook; mainstream sociology has a more left-wing perspective.\nMany people have talked about this gulf; for example Jon Elster has argued that sociologists’ methods of explanation (functionalism in particular) are invalid, that methodological individualism can be a viable way of thinking even for Marxists, and that it should not carry with it the taint of right-wing political individualism that it often does. But the exciting thing about work of Kranton and Akerlof is that they don’t just talk about the gulf, they do something about it, while respecting both traditions of thought. This is surely an important achievement.\nIdentity Economics _Identity Economics _explains many persistent social patterns like gender-based segregation in the workforce or the high rates of dropout from school among African Americans. It does so using the tools of rational choice – game theory, based on utility maximizing individuals and their interactions \u0026ndash; but it looks to the social phenomenon of identity as an important source of individual utility. Society is shaped by individuals who are shaped in turn by society. In a series of three long papers Kranton and Akerlof described an economics of identity and applied it to some important problems; they have now pulled together material from these papers and present the core ideas in book form.\nKranton and Akerlof investigate two environments where identity plays an important role: work and school. They also investigate two of the most obvious and important sources of identity in modern North American or European life: gender and race. In each of these cases, they find that adding identity to standard economic models provides convincing explanations for many different patterns of behavior and diagnose some serious social problems.\nLet’s take an example: why do “many African Americans seem to choose courses of action that middle-class white and black Americans consider disastrous” such as adopting a life of crime even though \u0026ldquo;crime does not pay” economically, and or dropping out of school even though “the rate of return to skill acquisition for blacks is, if anything, higher than for whites” [p99]? Traditional economic theories, they argue, cannot help us understand these patterns.\nA\u0026amp;K start with a “boilerplate economic model”: there are black and white workers and individual workers must decide whether or not to work at a given wage. But in addition to the economic outcomes, this choice carries with it a cost or benefit based on identity. They identify a set of pre-existing social categories that individuals may choose to identify with, and each social category carries with it a set of prescriptions, which may be behavioral _norms _or categorical ideals.\nIn this case the categories are insider and outsider.\nWhite workers are all, by definition, insiders. Black workers can choose whether to integrate and join the dominant majority as insiders. Alternatively, they can be outsiders, who remain apart and adopt an identity in opposition to the insiders. [p. 103]\nThe norm for an insider is to work for firms in this economy. Outsiders feel they should not be so submissive.\nAn individual African-American in this model faces a choice of social category (“I’ll always be an outsider…”) and a choice whether to conform to or to deviate from the prescriptions for that category (“…but I’ll do what it takes to get a job”). Costs and benefits accompany these choices because people internalize norms and ideals: “people follow norms much of the time because they want to do so. This conception does not correspond to economists’ usual view. To date, economists have mostly seen norms as sustained by external forces: people follow norms because if they do not, they could be punished in some way.” [p. 33] Violating the internalized norms of one’s category produces anxiety and stress.\nA\u0026amp;K quote journalist Jill Nelson after a job interview at the Washington Post to illustrate how identity manifests itself:\nI’ve also been doing the standard Negro balancing act when it comes to dealing with white folks, which involves sufficiently blurring the edges of my being so that they don’t feel intimidated, while simultaneously holding on to my integrity. There is a thin line between Uncle-Tomming and Mau-Mauing. To fall off that line can mean disaster: On one side lies employment and self-hatred; on the other, the equally dubious honor of unemployment with integrity.\nAs they walk through their approach, identity reveals itself as a convincing and self-consistent approach to complex problems. It explains why the best choice available to some African Americans is to adopt an oppositional identity and to opt out of the mainly white job market \u0026ndash; even though they may be economically better off to adopt an insider identity and pursue a job. Adopting the identity of an insider route may gain them more money, but they will always fail to conform to what an “ideal insider” should be, and this failure will exert a cost (“blurring the edges of my being”). Adopting the identity of an outsider but pursuing a career in the white world will also gain them money, but they will suffer anxiety and as a result of “Uncle-Tomming” – what Glen Loury calls a “dissonance between my self-concept and the socially imputed definition of who I am supposed to be… balancing my desire not to disappoint the expectations of others with a conviction that one must strive to live authentically.” [link]. Adopting an outsider identity and staying outside the working world will lose money, but will allow them to sustain a sense of living authentically. In this way, identity economics suggests that self-destructive behavior in marginalized communities is not the result of individual irrationality, or even of peer pressure to conform with existing destructive behavior, but can be seen as the best individual response to a world of low economic endowments and, among other things, to a high degree of social exclusion by the “insider” group. The refusal of whites to permit black workers to become true insiders is a key factor in the utilitarian calculus.\nThis is quite a different explanation for high incarceration rates, high out-of-wedlock birth rates, low employment rates, and a divergence in outcomes for African Americans [p. 99] to Becker’s model or economics models based on statistical discrimination or on peer-driven destructive behaviour.\nThe argument here has been descriptive, but in the original papers A\u0026amp;K set up a more formal structure and create a game for which the oppositional identity, with its associated prescriptions, can be an equilibrium. In the same way, gender prescriptions in the workplace, oppositional identities in the classroom, and employee decisions whether or not to identify with their employer all lead to consequences that, while familiar, have been difficult to explain from an economic point of view. Kranton and Akerlof are very respectful about the arguments made by Becker in his very different analyses of discrimination, but come to conclusions that are very different: while Becker has long argued that competitive markets will erode discrimination, A\u0026amp;K say that it is no surprise it took social movements to make real changes to gender or race-based discrimination.\nThe response to these papers has been, from what I can tell, lukewarm. Akerlof’s standing has given the arguments a profile that they otherwise would not have achieved, and there has been follow-up work by others, but ten years after the first paper was published, identity is a long way from being a part of mainstream economic thought and game theory is a long way from the mainstream of sociology. Why has the response been so muted, and what does each discipline have to gain from this venture?\nWhat economics has to gain from identity In the original papers A\u0026amp;K pursue a full, albeit qualitative, game theoretical treatment and show that for some magnitudes of costs there are mixed solutions: in particular, if the cost of “working in the white world but not ‘making it’” is large then it is rational for some black people to choose the insider identity, and it is rational for some to adopt an oppositional outsider identity, and to drop out of school at an early age.\nAt a lecture at the LSE in 2007 [Transcript, Slides], Akerlof said “I know that all of the economists in the audience have three thoughts. The first is that all of this gives up the parsimony of standard economics. The second question is whether identity is, or is not, observable. The third question concerns the endogeneity of identity.”\nI think there are two separate concerns behind the “parsimony” complaint. One is that some economists, having trained themselves to see the world through the lens of earlier models, have a blind spot for other factors and therefore think they are unimportant. There is a story of a group of impatient economists who offered $5 to the person ahead of them in the check-out line if they could switch places, and were surprised that the person was offended. These people have trained themselves to live in a world different from the one the rest of us live in. Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame fell into this category, but recognized the role of identity when he was caught in a traffic jam: I had read their [A\u0026amp;K’s] papers, but in general have such a weak sense of identity that I never really understood what they were talking about. The first time I really got what they meant was when I realized that a key part of my identity was that I was not the kind of person who would cut in line to shorten my commute, even though it would be easy to do so, and seemed crazy to wait for 15 minutes in this long line. But, if I were to cut in line, I would have to fundamentally rethink the kind of person I was. [Link]\nThe phrase “I am not the kind of person who…” is helpful when thinking about where identity intrudes into your own decision making. If you have sat in a car at a red light at an obviously-empty intersection, waiting for it to change rather than go through against the light, well that’s an identity-based decision, following the norms of the community you live in. I could easily take paper and pens from work, but I am not the kind of person who does that.\nBeyond such decisions, identity affects us whether we like it or not. We have internalized what it means to be the gender we are, what it means to be the race we are, so deeply that we usually do not notice it.\nParsimony is a technical issue too. One of the disappointments of game theory in the social sciences is that researchers found that anything beyond the most simple game delivered too many answers: an answer for every taste perhaps. The subtleties and grey areas around issues of identity seem like natural candidates for generating such multiple equilibria. Nevertheless, and I can’t convince you of this here, it seems to me that by staying with a qualitative approach, by phrasing their problems with care, and by introducing just enough identity into their models, Kranton and Akerlof have managed to find a way through the maze, to construct consistent, logical explanations for social patterns of real importance. This is a delicate and impressive balancing act; it remains to be seen if their success can be reproduced in other problems, or if the approach becomes limited by society’s complexity.\nThe second question is to ask where it comes from, this “identity”? Is it measurable? Here again, the problem is as much about the asker as the answer. Too many economists are hardcore reductionists who would rather look inside the brain for sources of utility (see the sillinesses of neuro-economics) than open their eyes to the world around them, and who see the work of other social sciences as fluffy, ill-defined, and inconsequential. But any evolutionary system resists purely reductive explanations. To explain dam-building behaviour in beavers we need to look not just at the genes they inherited but at the landscape they live in: the large and the small are tightly coupled and neither is “more fundamental” than the other. And if it is true that identity is difficult to quantify, and that the internal costs of breaking the norms of our identities are difficult to place on the same scale as dollars and cents, well that’s why all those other social scientists spend entire careers on the problems. The question reveals a deeply ingrained lack of respect for non-economic social sciences. Too many physics-envying economists seem to want to solve massively complex problems from first principles, but this agenda (doomed to fail) forces them to ignore massive amounts of useful observation. The semi-empirical approach of much theory of chemistry, in which the role of theory is to relate seemingly disparate observations and to see patterns where we did not see them before, is a better model for the social sciences.\nThe third question is to ask why identity must be exogenous (imported into the model from outside as a pre-defined force that constrain individual actions), rather than endogenous (emerging from the choices of the individuals). The identities and prescriptions associated with gender and race have developed over centuries and over continents. They did not evolve within the short timescale of a particular scenario under the microscope (employment choices of women in the first decade of the 21st century North America). And the prescriptions associated with white/black or male/female are not, of course, symmetrical: these are not arbitrary labels, but are the product of long and specific histories, which lie outside the scope of the situation being analyzed.\nMost of Kranton and Akerlof’s efforts in promoting Identity Economics have been aimed at fellow economists, trying to convince them of the validity of the approach. But there is another group who could benefit from their work, and that’s sociologists.\nWhat sociology has to gain from identity economics The response from some members of the other social sciences has been the opposite to that of skeptical economists. Instead of dismissing identity as fluffy and unobservable, they have decried the approach as obvious. Oh look, economists have finally noticed that identity matters! And they think it’s a big deal! Well lah-di-dah, tell us something we don’t know. [See comments at the Chronicle of Higher Education review for examples]\nSuch a response misses the point. First, Akerlof and Kranton make no claims to have discovered identity: they explicitly and repeatedly credit other social scientists with identifying it, exploring it, and making it a rich concept that they can use. The accusations of appropriation are empty. Second, they are doing something with identity that other social scientists have not done, and to ignore this is cutting off their nose to spite their face.\nSo what do sociologists, who recognize and understand identity, have to gain from identity economics? One answer is a single word: equilibrium, and my main disappointment with A\u0026amp;K’s book is that in simplifying their research they have avoided, even once, mentioning this crucial concept.\nBack in 1965 Mancur Olson’s The Logic of Collective Action showed that there are good reasons why “rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve their common or group interests” [p2]. If the benefits of collective action require all members of the group to share the load, then there is a commons problem where the best choice for individuals may be to free ride. It can make absolute sense for people to act as if they believe on thing, while believing another. It may, to take an example at random, make sense for individuals to shop at Wal-Mart even while they wish the store had never been built. Why? Because one decision (to allow Wal-Mart to be built or not) is a collective one, and the other decision (to shop at Wal-Mart or not) is an individual one.\nSometimes it has seemed to me as if all the avant-garde contortions of post-Marxist, post-modern political thought could have been avoided if sociologists had learned a little game theory. Instead, believing that it is in the interests of subjugated classes to throw off their shackles and yet seeing no shackles being thrown, they have resorted to more and more baroque explanations for this seeming contradiction. Terry Eagleton’s _Ideology: An Introduction _describes several of these explanations for why “people invest in their own unhappiness”.[xiii] The only common thread is that the populace fails to see the state of the world as it really is (otherwise they would act to change it): false consciousness is to blame; Habermas claims that consumerism bypasses meaning to engage the passive subject subliminally [37]; Althusser says that thought is conducted within the terms of an unconscious ‘problematic’ which silently underpins it and which ‘constitutes the limits of what we are able to utter and conceive’ [137]; Lacan argues that we live in a state of self-deception in which we have suppressed our true desires [53]; hegemonic discourses make subversive thoughts impossible to express, and so on. Yet simple game theory would have cut this Gordian knot. Eagleton writes that “If it is rational to settle for an ambiguous mixture of misery and marginal pleasure when the political alternatives appear perilous and obscure, it is equally rational to rebel when the miseries clearly outweigh the gratifications.”[xiv] But this ignores the collective action problem: just because it would be good for a group to rebel does not make it sensible for an individual to rebel. The contradiction is not a contradiction at all: was all this baroque theorizing really necessary?\nThat is overstating the case, of course. Olson may have explained why we can believe one thing and act in a seemingly contradictory way, but not all social patterns are reducible to tragedies of the commons. Identity-driven patterns are some of those that could not be explained by collective action logic alone.\nI think I can see why A\u0026amp;K chose to avoid spelling out the game theoretic portions of their investigations. To do so would have made a much longer and more difficult book, and so would have limited the audience. Yet as it stands the book presents what is really a theoretically sound, logically consistent methodology as if it were an identification of important factors in a situation coupled with rough and ready inferences. It underplays the work they have done. That work is still available in the papers, of course, but if the book is the way the ideas are transmitted, readers are missing an important piece of the puzzle.\nWhat game theory brings is an explanation of why certain patterns persist, and the introduction of identity extends these explanations to many important patterns. It is all very well to say that there are norms associated with the roles of women and men in the workforce, but such a statement is descriptive only. It does not explain how such norms sustain themselves, or why norms sometimes collapse (gays cannot marry, animals have rights). Identity economics spells out, qualitatively at least, how norms can be sustained in some cases while not in others. If the equilibrium of a model is one in which nobody chooses to be an outsider, the social category of “outsider” will vanish: left-handed people will cease to be sinister, for example.\nSociologists could benefit from Identity Economics because it clarifies the question of how and why identities and their prescriptions are sustained. Without the notion of equilibrium sociological explanations of how systems of oppression sustain themselves without explicit violence are vulnerable to the skeptical “why do people not simply choose otherwise?” that has sent them to psycho-analysis, structuralism and other sources of unconvincing obfuscation. But this question is not as damaging as it seems, once we realize that “because it is in their self-interest not to” is a perfectly reasonable answer.\nA second reason for sociologists to pay attention to Identity Economics is that game theory forces the researcher to be explicit and precise about what they mean by certain terms. So identity is a set of social categories, which carry prescriptions, which have costs and benefits. This is a simpler description of identity than I have seen anywhere else, and Kranton and Akerlof achieve this clarity because they have to make the concept fit into a game theory framework. Perhaps this misses some of the richness of sociological theory, but what it misses in richness it gains in clarity. And some of the “richness”, I suspect, is really just fuzziness anyway.\nIt is natural to ask, if identity can be drawn into an economic framework, whether other sociological concepts may be too. Despite its clarity, the pictures that Kranton and Akerlof draw should be seen as a beginning, not a closed and polished object.\nIdentity is a rich concept, and there are several associated concepts that K\u0026amp;A have not explicitly drawn on but which clearly impinge on their theory. Here are a few random thoughts to finish off. Ideologies are, Eagleton says, action-oriented sets of beliefs. They are beliefs that must be “capable of furnishing their adherents with goals, motivations, prescriptions, imperatives, and so on.“ [47] That is, ideology can be seen as the concept that connects social categories to their prescriptions. By studying identity, Kranton and Akerlof are studying ideology. A sentence from Eagleton reads simultaneously as if it could belong in an K\u0026amp;A paper, and also as if it comes from another planet: “A mode of domination is generally legitimated when those subjected to it come to judge their own behaviour by the criteria of their rulers. Someone with a Liverpool accent who believes he speaks incorrectly has legitimated an established cultural power.” [55] Alternatively, we can say they have adopted an insider identity, but fail to meet the ideal set of prescriptions associated with that identity. Kranton and Akerlof do not investigate class-based identity, but it exists in many cultures and has its own consequences, as anyone who was told not to “act above their station” or that some goals were “not for the likes of you” will recognize.\nWhile ideological beliefs may be the glue that connects social categories to prescriptions, Eagleton asks doubtfully if it makes sense that people would hold beliefs that they know to be untrue? This misrepresents the problem of knowledge in a social context. I may not hold beliefs that I know to be untrue, but I and many others do publicly subscribe to beliefs about which I have real doubts. Why would I do such a thing? Because I’m ignorant, and so I adopt the belief of people who have similar outlooks to myself: people who help to define the prescriptions for people in the social category to which I have elected to belong. I read and follow people whose arguments echo my own prejudices, in the absence of conclusive evidence I will continue to conform to common knowledge. To articulate beliefs carries with it a cost.\nThe distinction between identities and the actions associated with them is not always clear. Judith Butler’s argument that gender is a “performance” suggests that even the most seemingly hardwired identities are ones that we can choose. From the tiny bit I know, Butler goes all psycho-analytical as to why people would adopt various identities, but I wonder if a little game theory might help to clarify why, in some cultures, gender is strictly defined and binary while in others it is more fluid and multifaceted.\nSo you can see that I found much to admire here. I do wish the authors had brought more of the game theory background into the book; the notion of equilibrium would have made some passages more convincing to those who have not read the papers, but to this outsider it seems that both economists and sociologists have a lot to gain from studying this work: let’s just hope it doesn’t go too much against the prescriptions associated with their social categories as economists or sociologists to do so.\n","date":1275261670,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"131699eb44920ef991e237ee8d489331","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/identity-economics-by-george-akerlof-and-rachel-kranton-a-rambling-review/","publishdate":"2010-05-30T23:21:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/identity-economics-by-george-akerlof-and-rachel-kranton-a-rambling-review/","section":"post","summary":"Disclaimer I am neither a sociologist nor an economist , so instead of qualifying statements throughout – how boring would that be? – I am making one big boring disclaimer here: claims made here about the faults of various social sciences should be read with my amateur status in mind, and I’d appreciate comments from any passing professionals if they see big mistakes in what I say.\nThis is a long essay (4,000 words) and even those few who do want to read it won\u0026rsquo;t find it easy in blog form, so here is a PDF: Download Identity Economics.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\t\"Identity Economics\" by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton: A Rambling Review\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["wikibollocks"],"content":"Last Tuesday morning I sat in my pyjamas, reading Clay Shirky’s essay, “The Collapse of Complex Business Models” while waiting for the kettle to boil. The essay struck me as interesting, the kettle whistled, I went to eat breakfast.\nThat evening I reread the essay more closely, and the closer I read it, the less I liked it. At sunrise the essay had been an entertaining set of anecdotes built around an intriguing core idea; by sunset it had wilted, revealed as an entertaining set of anecdotes pulled from all over the map in the vain hope that there might, somewhere, be a theme that would hold them together.\nIt’s not the first time I have had this reaction to a Clay Shirky essay, and as each essay he writes gets a lot of attention (published earlier this month, googling [Shirky “Collapse of Complex Business Models”] already returns over 150,000 hits) it might be worth sketching out why he, along with other influential speakers who use a similar style, consistently fail to provide substance even as they succeed in reaching and influencing a large audience. So here are the Four Rules of Big Ideas: techniques the masters use to make that keynote more stimulating, that essay more likely to catch fire, all without doing too much thinking.\nThe thesis of Shirky’s essay, in case you haven’t read it, is that the nature of bureaucracy is such that traditional media companies, faced with declining revenues, are unable to cut production expenses, and so are headed towards collapse. Despite his title, the stories he tells are not a problem of “complex business models” but of “expensive production”, and even though it is uncredited, many readers will recognize the core of the essay from that other Clay, Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma.\nEverybody likes a story, and Clay Shirky tells a good one. Collecting stories is not difficult: if you think about a subject long enough, all kinds of tangential happenings remind you of it, so you’ll get a good selection to draw from before long. Sometimes these stories are only peripherally connected to the theme you are developing, but that doesn’t matter because their role is not to advance your argument in any material way. Their role is to contribute to the impression of a widely-read, eclectically educated piece of writing and to keep your audience off balance, not sure where you are going next.\nIn 1983 Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffmann visited the chemistry department at McMaster University. As the audienced assembled, Professor Ed Hileman leaned over a chair and said to me and other graduate students: “You watch - he’ll give an interesting talk but there will be no questions”. And he was right. Hoffmann’s talk was an extension of his Nobel lecture, a fascinating exposi tion of how the orbital symmetry rules he had developed could be extended to explain the structure of hundreds of organometallic complexes and clusters. But his talk answered all the questions it raised, and by answering them, sealed off avenues where questions could have been asked.\nIf you want to provoke discussion, logic and detail are not your friends. Instead, don’t worry about loose ends and half-expressed ideas - just keep the audience’s interest and provide colour, and let them fill in the gaps later. Make sure your audience is not sure what’s coming next, not sure if they quite understood what they just heard. That’s what makes for good entertainment. It’s the First Rule of Big Ideas: tell stories and think by analogy.\nHere is the shortest of the stories in Clay Shirky’s essay:\nDr. Amy Smith is a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, where she runs the Development Lab, or D-Lab, a lab organized around simple and cheap engineering solutions for the developing world.\nAmong the rules of thumb she offers for building in that environment is this: “If you want something to be 10 times cheaper, take out 90% of the materials.” Making media is like that now except, for “materials”, substitute “labor.”\nThe loose analogy with cheap engineering solutions tells us nothing new about the media and its problems. Why invoke it then? Well, it does suggest that successful engineering solutions for the developing world are evidence in favour of the thesis of the essay, although they are not, and it brings MIT on side with the argument, which can’t be bad. This is how stories and analogies work - they suggest connections between different fields, connect solutions to different problems.\nBut stories and analogies should be a starting point for thought, and not its terminus. They should be the spark that prompts more analytical, more rigorous investigation and introspection, testing out your idea to see where it fits reality and where it fails. In this essay, and in some of his others (see below) anecdotes are all there is, and that’s just not good enough.\nClay Shirky tells no fewer than five separate stories in his short essay. He explains how his title is taken from a book called The Collapse of Complex Societies; he tells a story about a consulting engagement he had at AT\u0026T; he spins his short MIT story; he talks about a web video comedy called In the Motherhood and how ABC failed to turn the web video into a successful TV series; and he talks about Charlie biting his brother’s finger on YouTube. Charming, each and every one, but what you might not notice on a first casual reading is that there is little to hold them together or back them up. Switching from story to story keeps the reader off-balance and makes it seem plausible that there is, in fact, a coherent mechanism behind the anecdata if only we were quick enough to catch it as the stories f ly by. But there isn’t. The resolution never appears. There is nothing behind the curtain.\nAside: here is Clay Shirky writing about YouTube:\nThe most watched minute of video made in the last five years shows baby Charlie biting his brother’s finger. (Twice!)\nwhich is, as of this date, no longer true. The most watched video made in the last five years shows Lady Gaga and a group of hired models dancing on an elaborate set in a video that embodies complex production methods, that is part of the Vevo channel (a joint venture between Google and major record labels) and that features product placements by Nemiroff Vodka, Parrot by Starck, Carerra sunglasses, and HP Envy [link]. Now there is a complex business model.\nAs a further aside, analysts Visible Measures add in all copies of a video together with spoofs and pastiches, and their list of the top fifteen videos is as follows.\n Soulja Boy: Crank Dat (music video: Universal) - 722,438,268\n Twilight Saga: New Moon (film: Summit Entertainment) - 639,966,996\n Beyonce: Single Ladies (music video: Sony) - 522,039,429\n Michael Jackson: Thriller (music video: Epic Records) - 443,535,722\n The Gummy Bear Song (music video: Gummibear International) - 394,327,606\n Lady Gaga: Poker Face (music video: Universal) - 374,606,128\n Lady Gaga: Bad Romance (music video: Universal) - 360,020,327\n TImbaland: Apologize (music video: Mosley Music Group) - 355,404,824\n Susan Boyle: Britain’s Got Talent (TV: Freemantle/ITV) - 347,670,927\n Twilight (film: Summit Entertainment) - 343,969,063\n Modern Warfare 2 (video game: Activision) - 339,913,412\n Jeff Dunham: Achmed the Dead Terrorist (TV) - 328,891,308\n Mariah Carey: Touch My Body (music video: Universal) - 324,057,568\n Charlie Bit My Finger Again (user generated) - 288,666,331\n Michael Jackson: Beat It (music video: Records) - 286,279,009\n  It seems that complexity has its place after all.\nA natural response to this complaint would be that this one particular video is not “the point”; that I don’t “get it”, that it is not what the essay is really “about”. After all, Clay also writes this sentence:\nIn the future, at least some methods of producing video for the web will become as complex, with as many details to attend to, as television has today, and people will doubtless make pots of money on those forms of production.\nAnd here is one benefit of building an essay on anecdata: you can always argue that a particular story is “not the point”. To take it one step further, here is the Second Rule of Big Ideas: make the point catchy, but make it ambiguous. As Thomas Friedman has said, “He who names an issue, owns it”, so a memorable name (”The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention”) counts far more than an accurate one, and an oracular title is the best of all. The title of Shirky’s essay is not up there with that of his next book “Cognitive Surplus”, which is an obvious attempt to coin a new phrase, but it does use the rule. The Collapse of Complex Business Models has a ring of down-to-earth pragmatism about it: if you are slave to an obsolete business model, then you get what you deserve. But a business model is a strategy for matching costs to revenues in such a way that you end up with a profit, and all he really writes about is one part of a business model: production costs. Why then not call it “The Collapse of Complex Production Methods”? My guess is that, consciously or not, Clay chose “business model” because it is a bigger, more abstract, and less concrete concept than “production costs” and using “business models” keeps the point of the essay ambitious, ambiguous and open to interpretation.\nThe rule extends beyond the title into the text itself. Clay has a reputation for being plain-spoken and jargon-free, but that’s not really accurate. He doesn’t load up his talks and essays with the jargon of the field he is talking about (culture), but he does sprinkle them with jargon from many places, leaning most heavily to economics and engineering. He borrows liberally from economics with his talk of “the marginal value of complexity”, Coasian transaction costs, and also the ”supply-and-demand curve” (really?). He switches to engineering when he refers to societal collapse as “sudden decoherence” and discussed negotiations that “took place in the grid of the television industry”, and to business lingo with his talk of “ecosystems” and supply curves going “parabolic”. The language is colourful, and it carries the reader along. It speaks to his natural audience of geeks and techno-enthusiasts, but the lack of precision keeps the audience on its toes while hinting, again, at deeper truths behind the anecdotes. But there appear to be no such truths; we are left with theoretical language without the theory.\nThe five stories in Clay’s essay follow a practice attributed to The Economist, which is the Third Rule of Big Ideas: simplify and exaggerate. Take the one about network television’s failure to translate Web TV program In The Motherhood to the mainstream. Clay writes this:\nOnce the show moved to television, the Writers Guild of America got involved. They were OK with For and About Moms, but By Moms violated Guild rules. The producers tried to negotiate, to no avail, so the idea of audience engagement was canned (as was In the Motherhood itself some months later, after failing to engage viewers as the web version had).\nThe critical fact was that the negotiation took place in the grid of the television industry, between entities incorporated around a 20th century business logic, and entirely within invented constraints. At no point did the negotiation about audience involvement hinge on the question “Would this be an interesting thing to try?”\nThe message is clear: unions and media corporations are inflexible dinosaurs, unable to deal with the chaotic creativity of the digital 21st century.\nHe could have chosen other stories with other messages. Media corporations are not as inflexible as Shirky would have us believe. Rupert Murdoch, one of the media barons Clay quotes as a dinosaur, is an expert at reducing production costs and limiting union rights (Wapping, anyone?). And has Clay not noticed reality television? The networks have been hugely successful at cutting the cost of Writers’ Guild members from their balance sheets over the last ten years.\nOn the other side, the brave new world is not so different. For a small startup to be bought by a large company and ground down by the bureaucratic pressures of its new environment is not unique to the media business: it’s commonplace in the software industry too. And there are many “complex business models” in the digital world that Clay chooses to ignore: Google’s partnerships with major media companies, the licensing complexities of Facebook’s ever-changing privacy rules and third party APIs, Amazon’s outsourcing of warehousing through its complex partner programs - these business models are not just complex, they are positively byzantine, charting ever more circuitous and indirect routes between production and revenue. They just don’t appear in the stories he tells.\nUseful though they are, the rules of telling stories, keeping the core idea ambiguous, and following the “simplify and exaggerate” maxim can only go so far in bringing your audience on to your side. The Fourth and Final Rule of Big Ideas is to play on our natural identification with the underdog by casting the anecdotes and your overarching theme in a rebellious and revolutionary light. The stories Clay tells may be diverse in terms of their origin, but they share a common tone, which is that of the creative individual (hooray!) against the stuffy institution (boo!); the plucky and resourceful underdog (go Charlie!) versus the monolithic, massive but ultimately stupid corporation (down with ABC!).\nBack to his Charlie story again:\nExpensive bits of video made in complex ways now compete with cheap bits made in simple ways. “Charlie Bit My Finger” was made by amateurs, in one take, with a lousy camera. No professionals were involved in selecting or editing or distributing it. Not one dime changed hands anywhere between creator, host, and viewers. A world where that is the kind of thing that just happens from time to time is a world where complexity is neither an absolute requirement nor an automatic advantage.\nBut Charlie didn’t “just happen” because Charlie is not the only story here. As YouTube became a phenomenon, those 174 million-and-counting views could only be delivered by acres of these:\nhoused in several of these:\nComplexity is not going away. It’s just moving to a different spot in the production chain, and as it moves so does the balance of power.\nYears ago companies like P\u0026amp;G, Coca Cola and the other manufacturers would dictate to the stores that sold their goods how to do so, mandating marketing campaigns and product positioning. But now the balance of power has now shifted closer to the customer - to Wal-Mart and the retailers, who send Coca Cola back to change the taste of their drink and who tell P\u0026amp;G to pay for the privilege of managing Wal-Mart’s shampoo shelves. Amazon and Google are trying to become the Wal-Mart of the cultural world, increasingly dictating terms to their suppliers. But while the stories of Amazon and Google are part of today’s reality, they are not stories Clay wants to tell because they don’t fit his agenda. He would rather stick with Charlie and the finger biting. And that populism is a problem, partly because for all his promotion of the underdog Clay ends up consistently on side of the free market and against collective efforts by working people to gain a respectable source of income.\nIf the problems with The Collapse of Complex Business Models were restricted to that essay I would be more forgiving, but they show up elsewhere too. In a recent conversation with Evgeny Morozov on Digital Power and its Discontents Clay talks about the 1959 Krushchev-Nixon “kitchen debate”, jumps to Iran, then immediately to Singapore’s efforts at censorship, and on to Burma, to China, and to Belarus and to his favourite author Habermas. He covers a lot of ground, but never stops to look around or to reflect on what we can learn from one case - he’s on to the next before you can stop him.\nAnd when Clay talks about “a public that can\u0026hellip; self-synchronize”, asks “how much is the political sensitivity of the [Iranian] regime titrated to the price of oil?” and suggests that Iran is “acquiring a kind of technological auto-immune disease” it is impossible not to think that he is more concerned with the novelty of his images than with actual clarity or, in fact, meaning.\nThe same goes for the ambiguous title of his forthcoming book, “Cognitive Surplus”. In the lecture it has grown from (text version here) he talks about the role of gin in the industrial revolution, about Wikipedia’s article on Pluto, about a Wiki map of crime in Brazil, about Gilligan’s Island, and about a friend’s four-year-old daughter looking for a mouse. It’s entertaining but there is more cuteness than substance to the title. I look forward to reviewing it.\nTowards the end of his conversation with Evgeny Morozov, Clay observes that “This is one of the really interesting things about these questions, \u0026hellip; you very quickly get a kind of philosophic vertigo. You think you’re asking a question about Twitter, and suddenly you realize you’re asking about, say, Hayek and markets.” I can only say: Clay, vertigo is not inevitable, it is a choice you have made, and maybe you should make a different one.\n","date":1272197169,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5935e06024f95c91c5312ae1beb7a777","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/wikibollocks-the-shirky-rules/","publishdate":"2010-04-25T12:06:09Z","relpermalink":"/post/wikibollocks-the-shirky-rules/","section":"post","summary":"Last Tuesday morning I sat in my pyjamas, reading Clay Shirky’s essay, “The Collapse of Complex Business Models” while waiting for the kettle to boil.

On the other hand, there is its embrace of secrecy around its core operations, its willingness to promote digital rights management for big media on Vevo, and its cavalier attitude to privacy.\nGoogle is a company that frames its actions in ethical terms, and which takes a public stance on issues beyond its immediate commercial concerns, while making it clear that it\u0026rsquo;s a business and it exists to make money. The language makes it easy to think about Google as \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo;, and to search for some commonality among its actions along those lines. If it\u0026rsquo;s good then we can trust it with our private information. If it\u0026rsquo;s evil, then its apparently good actions must be a cloak to hide some more devious intent. [](https://writer.zoho.com/#nen1)[Before anyone accuses me of setting up a straw man here are a few quotes from a single story hosted, of course, on Google News. Many more available on request.:\n \u0026ldquo;I do think that Google is a bit idealistic; they have a streak there,\u0026rdquo; said Colin Maclay, managing director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.\n \u0026ldquo;I do think a good part of this is they want to do the right thing,\u0026rdquo; Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of Google. \u0026ldquo;But none of these decisions are simple.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;Google believes that one of its asset values is righteousness,\u0026rdquo; said Gartner vice president and analyst Whit Andrews. \u0026ldquo;It believes if it was not righteous, it would not make as much money as it does.\u0026rdquo;]\n  Thinking in good-guys/bad-guys terms leads only to confusion. Despite the language, Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t have ethics, it has interests. Sometimes those interests coincide with ours, and sometimes they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nSome time ago Nicholas Carr suggested that complementary goods are the key to understanding Google:\nComplements are, to put it simply, any products or services that tend be consumed together. Think hot dogs and mustard, or houses and mortgages. For Google, literally everything that happens on the Internet is a complement to its main business. The more things that people and companies do online, the more ads they see and the more money Google makes. In addition, as Internet activity increases, Google collects more data on consumers’ needs and behavior and can tailor its ads more precisely, strengthening its competitive advantage and further increasing its income. As more and more products and services are delivered digitally over computer networks - entertainment, news, software programs, financial transactions - Google’s range of complements is expanding into ever more industry sectors.\nNearly everything the company does, including building big data centers, buying optical fiber, promoting free Wi-Fi access, fighting copyright restrictions, supporting open source software, and giving away Web services and data, is aimed at reducing the cost and expanding the scope of Internet use. To borrow a well-worn phrase, Google wants information to be free — and that is why Google strikes fear into so many different kinds of companies. There’s one more twist. Because the marginal cost of producing and distributing a new copy of a purely digital product is close to zero, Google not only has the desire to give away informational products; it has the economic leeway to actually do it. Those two facts — the vast breadth of Google’s complements, and the company’s ability to push the price of those complements toward zero — set the company apart from other firms.\nThe idea of complements captures much of Google\u0026rsquo;s strategy, but it has a couple of limitations.\n IBM uses free Linux to sell expensive hardware and services, just as Gillette famously used cheap razors to sell blades, but Google promotes the free nature of the Web to sell our eyeballs to advertisers, and that\u0026rsquo;s not the same. Most of us are not Google\u0026rsquo;s customers, we are Google\u0026rsquo;s product.\n Many of Google\u0026rsquo;s actions are more legal and political than economic.\n  Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m splitting hairs, but there is another way to think about Google, that comes from political science rather than economics. It explains why Google provides or secures the provision of some public goods on the Internet while limiting the provision of others; why it is genuinely interested in the long-term health of the Internet as a safe environment for users, and why we still shouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust it with our data.\n[Aside: I have a feeling that this post is at best a partial success. At the same time, the purely economic description in terms of complementary goods does not cover much of what Google does. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested to hear of other frameworks for thinking about Google. Or whether it matters.]\nIn his posthumously published Power and Prosperity, Mancur Olson tells a story of China in the 1920s, when the warlord Feng Yu-hsiang defeated \u0026ldquo;a notorious roving bandit called White Wolf\u0026rdquo;. Most people in Feng\u0026rsquo;s domain preferred life permanently under the thumb of a warlord to life prone to the periodic invasion of roving bandits, and Olson wondered why? His answer was that even a warlord who wants to extract as much tax from his citizens as possible must look to the future, and unlike a roving bandit that future depends on having a relatively productive population. There is an alignment of interests between the population and the warlord that does not exist between the population and the bandits: it is in the interest of the warlord to restrain his takings and so ensure that his victims have a motive to be productive. The warlord also has a motive to clamp down on crime (other than his own), and to provide public goods that benefit those he taxes. Olson describes this as a \u0026ldquo;second invisible hand\u0026rdquo;, by which autocrats are guided \u0026ldquo;to use their power, at least to some degree, in accord with the social interest.\u0026rdquo; In a similar way, in a neighbourhood under the control of organized crime there will be no robberies, only a protection racket.\nIn many ways the Internet is, of course, a place. There is even a word, netizen, to describe us in our role as citizens of the Internet. And if the Internet is going to be a reasonable place to spend our time someone has to provide those common goods that keep it so - security, community standards, and so on. Who will do so?\nGoogle is a warlord of the Internet, surrounded by bandits. It provides public goods because its revenue (advertisements) depends on a safe and yet wide-open Internet. For Google to make money the Internet must be accessible from Google\u0026rsquo;s search engine: enclosures are a threat to its business, whether they be ad-funded like Facebook or subscription-funded like the Wall Street Journal. Netizens must be comfortable and safe from bandits as they go about their daily electronic lives. Google also clamps down on attempts by companies other than itself to generate revenue from the Internet, for example by pushing the limits of copyright in its book-copying efforts, or by pushing open source software at the client side of applications.\nWhile autocrats provide some public goods, there is a limit and in Google\u0026rsquo;s case we see that limit in privacy and to some extent in copyright. When CEO Eric Schmidt says (30 second video) \u0026ldquo;if you have something that you don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing it in the first place\u0026rdquo;, we have bumped up against that limit. And while we may be grateful to Google for keeping us free from the claims of copyright owners, attempts to restrict advertising on and around content will not find a friend in Google.\nSo yes, let\u0026rsquo;s appreciate Google\u0026rsquo;s stance on China despite what perceptive critics such as Evgeny Morozov say, but let\u0026rsquo;s not kid ourselves that Google is anything other than an organization with some interests that overlap ours.\n","date":1263729219,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0eb130a3ac61fbae1e2ba394e5156f8a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/google-as-warlord/","publishdate":"2010-01-17T11:53:39Z","relpermalink":"/post/google-as-warlord/","section":"post","summary":"How to think about Google?\nOn the one hand there is its widespread participation in open source projects, its statements in favour of openness, its consistent promotion of net neutrality, its recent announcement about \u0026ldquo;pulling out\u0026rdquo; of China, and its opposition to California\u0026rsquo;s discriminatory Proposition 8.

(Links - Round one: Morozov and Shirky. Round two: Morozov and Shirky.)\nIn brief, Morozov worries \u0026ldquo;what do we really gain if the ability to organise protests is matched (and, perhaps, even dwarfed) by the ability to provoke, identify and arrest the protesters?\u0026rdquo; Shirky, who is in moderate \u0026ldquo;Shirky mode\u0026rdquo; as opposed to demagogic \u0026ldquo;Clay mode\u0026rdquo;, counters that \u0026ldquo;While the use of social media in the Iranian protests quickly garnered the label \u0026lsquo;Twitter Revolution,\u0026rsquo; the real revolution was the use of mobile phones, which allowed the original protesters to broadcast their actions to other citizens and to the wider world with remarkable speed and immediacy. This characteristic, of a rapidly assembling and self-documenting public, is more than just a new slogan.\u0026rdquo;\nThere is a technology arms race between the protesters and the government, in which increasingly sophisticated levels of censorship, censorship evasion, identity masking, and so on are all playing a part. Your Facebook account might be a great way to communicate with others of a shared viewpoint but others can track you on it, and Iranian airport security have apparently asked travellers to sign in to their accounts in front of them. Activists use proxy servers to protect their identity, but if they are discovered using this technology then it may be treated as evidence of guilt. And so on.\nThe thing with an arms race is that, whoever wins (if anyone), the benefit is tiny compared to the effort expended by both sides. The hype over the role of digital technologies in protest is overblown because it is proportional to the amount and visibility of effort, not to the benefit the activists gain. In a country full of mobile phones, the mobile phone will be used to communicate; in a country with portable digital cameras, digital videos will be the way to broadcast events. But just because everyone is using the new technology doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s making a big difference to the balance of power or to the action on the ground.\nDigital technologies don\u0026rsquo;t shift the balance of power partly because they are prone to the kind of arms races Morozov identifies, but also because they don\u0026rsquo;t address the major obstacles that stand in the way of dissident groups, either in autocratic countries or in democracies. When Czechs organized to overthrow their government back in 1989 they faced many obstacles, but transmitting information was not one of the big ones. They had many ways to distribute what they needed: they leaked information to Western TV and radio stations who would broadcast it back to millions of listeners; they used official photocopiers to make hundreds of copies of samizdats, networks of music fans turned themselves into subversive communication webs, actors read anti-government news instead of reciting their lines at dramatic performances. \u0026ldquo;We were much more co-ordinated than people realize today, so that people in Czechoslovakia were able to know almost immediately what was happening in Poland and East Germany, even though it could not be reported or even mentioned in the official media\u0026rdquo;. [Doug Saunders, The Globe and Mail, October 29, 2009] If information is not the main problem for protest movements, then the Internet is not the solution.\nTo the extent that information is a problem, it\u0026rsquo;s not the kind of information that the Internet deals in anyway. After all, here is some information for you:\n2 + 2 = 5\nI can post this in a blog, tweet it, put it in my Facebook status, or even make a video of it. It can be encoded in bytes, so it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;information\u0026rdquo; in that sense, but it\u0026rsquo;s obviously not \u0026ldquo;information\u0026rdquo; that is useful to anyone. What activists need in autocratic countries is not \u0026ldquo;ways to share information\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;ways to share trusted information securely and privately\u0026rdquo;. And the barrier to this is not \u0026ldquo;sharing\u0026rdquo; but establishing trust. When Russians re-typed samizdats and passed them on to those with similar views, the typing was a pain but the real issue was knowing who to trust.\nThe need for trust is part of why the transaction-cost analysis of group formation favoured by Clay Shirky and others is wrong-headed when it comes to activism, especially in a hazardous environment. As Hayagreeva Rao argues in Market Rebels (review), forming groups is largely a matter of establishing a shared identity, and establishing an identity is inherently a costly activity. High transaction costs are not an inhibitor to forming many kinds of groups because commitment is part of what makes groups successful. Signing up to join a group is a \u0026ldquo;performative\u0026rdquo; statement and, like apologies, its meaning is in the cost to the speaker. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to sign up to a Facebook group than if you have to actually go and meet someone, but if signing up is so easy it\u0026rsquo;s not likely to be much of a group, just as an automated phone apology that \u0026ldquo;all our agents are busy right now\u0026rdquo; is cheap, and so is not much of an apology. Some groups deliberately make joining difficult by imposing artificial initiation rites on new members. It\u0026rsquo;s all part of establishing trust among group members, and the Internet doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much to help - or hinder - that crucial step.\n","date":1263126530,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"56d4969a3b61040c26b475c45fbe18b5","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/digital-activism-if-information-is-not-the-problem-information-is-not-the-solution/","publishdate":"2010-01-10T12:28:50Z","relpermalink":"/post/digital-activism-if-information-is-not-the-problem-information-is-not-the-solution/","section":"post","summary":"Right after I finished Matthew Hindman\u0026rsquo;s book The Myth of Digital Democracy, Prospect Magazine has published a debate between Evgeny Morozov and Clay Shirky about digital activism in authoritarian countries, particularly Iran.

The book is about collecting and analyzing the following large data sets on the way to this conclusion:\n The links among 3 million American political web pages together with data showing how Google leads its users to political sites. Hindman concludes that \u0026ldquo;link structure is an effective proxy for audience share\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;communities of Web sites on different political topics are each dominated by a small set of highly successful sites\u0026rdquo;. The scale of online concentration is so profound, he argues, that claims the Internet \u0026ldquo;democratizes\u0026rdquo; politics are misleading. For example, when it comes to blogs, \u0026ldquo;the top blogs are now the most widely read sources of political commentary in the United States\u0026rdquo;, but these widely-read bloggers are very few in number (a few dozen) and they are \u0026ldquo;overwhelmingly.. well-educated white male professionals\u0026rdquo;. The kind of voices that get heard in political discussion are the same kind that were heard through offline media, only perhaps more so. \u0026ldquo;The vigorous online debate that blogs provide may be, on balance, a good thing for US democracy. But as many continue to celebrate the democratic nature of blogs, it is important to acknowledge that many voices are left out.\u0026rdquo;\n Data from Hitwise of search-engine-directed traffic show that online politics is a tiny sliver of Internet traffic, and that \u0026ldquo;Scholars, public officials, and journalists have paid a great deal of attention to online politics. Citizens themselves, though, have directed their attention elsewhere.\u0026rdquo; Not too surprising perhaps.\n Data from Hitwise and other sources, of patterns of concentration in [American] online and traditional news media. He concludes that online media is much more concentrated (a few outlets get a larger share of the traffic) than many offline industries, particularly radio. The biggest story is what he calls \u0026ldquo;the missing middle\u0026rdquo;:\n  From the beginning, the Internet has been portrayed as a media Robin Hood - robbing audience from the big print and broadcast outlets and giving it to the little guys. But the data in this chapter suggest that audiences are moving in both directions. On the one hand, the news market in cyberspace seems even more concentrated on the top ten or twenty outlets than print media is. On the other, the tiniest outlets have indeed earned a substantial portion of the total eyeballs\u0026hellip; It is the middle-class outlets that have seen relative decline in the online world. Moreover, it is overwhelmingly smaller, local media organizations that have lost out to national sources. [p100]\nIt is a refreshing change to read a book about the cultural and political impact of the Internet that actually looks closely at Internet traffic (what people read) rather than at the number of sites (what people write), and it\u0026rsquo;s this perspective that leads Hindman to his myth-busting conclusions. The main flaw of the book is that it falls between two stools: it\u0026rsquo;s clearly an academic work that started as a set of papers or a thesis, but it is looking for a wider, popular audience. To reach that audience, Hindman should have got rid of many technical details and written a book with more narrative, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind reading technical studies, this is a good one, and I recommend it.\n_The Myth of Digital Democracy _has been out for a year or so now, so after I finished it, I looked at some reviews, and got a surprise. The books detractors argue that no one claimed the Internet democratizes politics, and if they ever did then they don\u0026rsquo;t any more, and if they still do then they mean something different.\nSo here are links to some critiques of Hindman\u0026rsquo;s book, and some words in defence of The Myth of Digital Democracy:\n Charlie Beckett of the LSE\u0026rsquo;s think tank POLIS writes that the idea \u0026ldquo;that the Internet is innately democratic and that it will have revolutionary political consequences\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;a straw man\u0026rdquo;. He goes on: \u0026ldquo;I always struggle in lectures or talks when I have to find quotes from these digital utopians. I can always cite lots of people (like me) who argue that the Internet has given us great tools and that it offers huge potential for civic engagement and public self-expression. I can even find examples, from Mysociety to Iran and Twitter that show concrete cases. But I don’t know many serious people talking about a revolution.\u0026rdquo;\n  This is a little cheeky from someone whose own book is called SuperMedia, and which is publicised as a \u0026ldquo;manifesto\u0026rdquo; for a \u0026ldquo;radical new relationship between the media and the public\u0026rdquo;, and which apparently \u0026ldquo;explores the potential for an entirely new type of journalism\u0026hellip; and makes the case that journalism could be the catalyst for change needed to solve many of the world\u0026rsquo;s problems.\u0026rdquo; All sounds pretty revolutionary to me. Beckett is getting hung up on the title, which was probably the publisher\u0026rsquo;s idea anyway, and needs to read the book more closely.\nAs for actually finding quotes about the Internet\u0026rsquo;s innately democratic and revolutionary (or at least radically disruptive) nature, well there\u0026rsquo;s always Google\u0026rsquo;s description of its own PageRank search algorithm as \u0026ldquo;drawing on the uniquely democratic nature of the Internet\u0026rdquo; and its recent claims that in Iran, citizen video reporting via YouTube \u0026ldquo;appears to have become an essential part of their struggle\u0026rdquo;. Or there\u0026rsquo;s Lawrence Lessig in Remixed: \u0026ldquo;The neutral platform of the Internet democratized technical and commercial innovation. Power was thus radically shifted.\u0026rdquo; Or Yochai Benkler at the very beginning of his influential The Wealth of Networks: \u0026ldquo;Enabled by technological change, we are beginning to see a series of economic, social, and cultural adaptations that make possible a radical transformation of how we make the information environment we occupy as autonomous individuals, citizens, and members of cultural and social groups. It seems passe today to speak of \u0026lsquo;The Internet revolution.\u0026rsquo; In some academic circles, it is positively naive. But it should not be.\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s ignoring all the talk of Twitter Revolutions in Moldova and Iran, and Egypt\u0026rsquo;s Facebook Revolution.\nDiscussion of the Internet\u0026rsquo;s impact on all aspects of our society is routinely cast in a revolutionary light, with a strong dose of \u0026ldquo;power to the people\u0026rdquo;, and if such language is usually kept out of academic journals, that\u0026rsquo;s no reason to ignore it.\n For Mark Bahnisch of Inside Story, Hindman \u0026ldquo;narrows down the possible targets for his myth-busting to the claim that the internet will bring about \u0026lsquo;democratisation.\u0026rsquo; But it\u0026rsquo;s unclear who\u0026rsquo;s actually making this claim, and Hindman ignores most of the more nuanced and specialised scholarship on the topic. If what he has to say when he gets down and dirty with the blogs later on is any indication, the real target is a nuch of journos and op-edders writing in the New York Times circa 2004.\u0026rdquo;\n  Bahnisch is saying Hindman should ignore \u0026ldquo;journos and op-edders\u0026rdquo; with audiences of millions and focus instead on \u0026ldquo;nuanced and specialised\u0026rdquo; scholarship that general readers like me will never read. Rubbish. The real debate about the role of the Internet is a public one, and Hindman has done exactly the right thing to tackle this perception that\u0026rsquo;s out there among the unwashed masses like myself. If the nuanced and specialized among us have good things to say, they should get out there in public and say them.\n When it comes to the concept of democratization, Bahnisch and others people bring up \u0026ldquo;Michel Bauwens\u0026rsquo; concept of equipotentiality\u0026rdquo; as an alternative meaning interpretation of \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo;. Equipotentiality is a fancy word for speculations about how peer-to-peer networks function: no one said that democratization means a wider set of voices are heard, simply that anyone can potentially reach an audience of millions, and if only a few do, well good for them.\n  The whole point Hindman\u0026rsquo;s approach makes is that concepts, whether they coin new words or not, need to be grounded in reality. Is the loose world of blogs equipotential? Who knows, given the vagueness of the concept? But that potential is certainly not equirealized and that\u0026rsquo;s a point worth making.\n Allison Hayward writes that \u0026ldquo;to observe that \u0026lsquo;digital democracy isn\u0026rsquo;t always and everywhere the rule is not the same thing as saying that the Internet hasn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;democratized\u0026rsquo; politics\u0026hellip; For the Internet to be \u0026lsquo;democratizing\u0026rsquo; we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t require that it be revolutionary, only that at the margins it provide a broader population with more opportunities to contribute, volunteer, engage, and advocate, and make changes that are sustainable over time.\u0026rdquo;\n  Sigh. Hindman has demonstrated that many of these functions are not accessible to a broader population in any meaningful way. The book challenges those who believe the Internet is \u0026ldquo;democratizing\u0026rdquo; in whatever way to show there is some substance to these claims, and the rebuttals are wishful thinking based in, well, nothing much really.\n Matt Bai argues that Hindman\u0026rsquo;s data is old, and \u0026ldquo;the political impact of the Internet is spreading so quickly that it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to capture and quantify\u0026rdquo;: he disparages Hindmans\u0026rsquo;s graphs and equations and prefers anecdotes about internet activists from modest backgrounds.\n  By the time I\u0026rsquo;d read this review I was feeling pretty sorry for Matthew Hindman, because it is clear that he just can\u0026rsquo;t win. Bai has a belief in the power of the Internet that borders on the mystical (\u0026ldquo;spreading so quickly that it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to capture and quantify\u0026rdquo;), so what would it take to persuade him otherwise? Nothing short of careful, detailed data I\u0026rsquo;m sure. But when someone does the work, well it takes time, and so it is dismissed as \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; and full of obscure graphs and equations. There is little point entering such an argument.\n Along these lines Henry Farrell, in the Times Higher Education Supplement, suggests that Hindman should just not engage with these claims, that he spends too much time \u0026ldquo;refuting bad ideas\u0026rdquo; and tackling \u0026ldquo;stupid claims for the democratic benefits of technological pixie dust\u0026rdquo; and goes on to say that \u0026ldquo;To really understand how the internet affects democratic politics, we need to forget about the internet evangelists. Not only were they badly wrong, but their notions of democracy were sloppy and unhelpful.\u0026rdquo;\n  I sympathize with Henry Farrell: it would be nice if we could forget about bad ideas and move ahead on more constructive paths, and I hope people do. But sloppy or not, those notions of democracy are out there, and are still influential, and Hindman has made a valuable contribution towards refuting them.\n","date":1262997231,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"c5148be7334f884d80d5a96959fdc2f2","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-myth-of-digital-democracymatthew-hindman-princeton-university-press-2009matthew-hindmansthe-myth-of-digital-democracyfi/","publishdate":"2010-01-09T00:33:51Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-myth-of-digital-democracymatthew-hindman-princeton-university-press-2009matthew-hindmansthe-myth-of-digital-democracyfi/","section":"post","summary":"The Myth of Digital Democracy, Matthew Hindman, Princeton University Press 2009\nThe last sentence of Matthew Hindman\u0026rsquo;s The Myth of Digital Democracy is \u0026ldquo;It may be easier to speak in cyberspace, but it remains difficult to be heard\u0026rdquo;.

Maybe opening up the algorithms will provide a solution.  **\nNeutrality and the Common Carriage Bargain**\nAt the heart of the net neutrality debate is an old bargain called common carriage [Christian Sandvig link to a small PDF]:\nCommon carriage is a common law legal concept that may date to the Roman empire... In brief, a common carrier is a private party offering transport or communication services who is subject to special public duties in return for legal benefits. The chief obligation of the common carrier is nondiscrimination—it must undertake to carry all people indiscriminately. (This is of course the center of the network neutrality debate.) Common carriers include railroads, taxis, airplanes, and telephones. In exchange for this burden of nondiscrimination, common carriers have received a number of benefits: chiefly, liability protection. As common carriers can have no interest in the content that they carry, they are not liable for transporting stolen property—you can’t sue the phone company for copyright infringement if a telephone is used to read aloud a copyrighted work. Carriers may also not be liable for any other illegal content: offensive messages, indecent messages, or death threats.  The bargain is a problem for Internet Service Providers who want to carry out content-based traffic shaping to make the most of their investment in networks but who don\u0026rsquo;t want to be liable for illegal or offensive content passing through their systems. Profit and liability go together: ISPs who argue that \u0026ldquo;we can\u0026rsquo;t be responsible to the law for the content we deliver, but we have to be responsible to our shareholders for the content we deliver\u0026rdquo; have an obvious consistency problem.\nCommon Carriage 2.0\nAs the Web has morphed into Web 2.0, openness is less about filtering at the level of TCP/IP packets and more about what the major platform owners do. Peer to peer traffic has fallen off dramatically in the last couple of years, replaced by video streaming from YouTube and file sharing sites such as Rapidshare [link]. What responsibilities does Google have for the content of YouTube videos? Is Rapidshare a common carrier? And is there a role for search neutrality as well as net neutrality?\nHere is where the common carriage bargain comes in. Google\u0026rsquo;s advertising-driven business model is based on matching advertisements to content. As soon as Google started down this path it could no longer shrug its shoulders at regulators and say \u0026ldquo;who me? I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s on YouTube. I\u0026rsquo;m just the carrier.\u0026rdquo; To make money it built algorithms that know about the nature of the content, and the more it wants to make money the more those algorithms will know, and the copyright owners will have Google by the short-and-curlies.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s response has been to accept liability to preserve its advertising revenue. And where does that revenue come from? Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s Ye Olde Media Companies [September 2008 link]:\n_McKinsey Quarterly: _Will the Internet bring down barriers, making markets more democratic? _Eric Schmidt: _I would like to tell you that the Internet has created such a level playing field that the long tail is absolutely the place to be—that there's so much differentiation, there’s so much diversity, so many new voices. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. What really happens is something called a power law, with the property that a small number of things are very highly concentrated and most other things have relatively little volume. Virtually all of the new network markets follow this law. So, while the tail is very interesting, the vast majority of revenue remains in the head. And this is a lesson that businesses have to learn. While you can have a long tail strategy, you better have a head, because that's where all the revenue is. And, in fact, it's probable that the Internet will lead to larger blockbusters and more concentration of brands. Which, again, doesn’t make sense to most people, because it’s a larger distribution medium. But when you get everybody together they still like to have one superstar. It's no longer a US superstar, it's a global superstar. So that means global brands, global businesses, global sports figures, global celebrities, global scandals, global politicians. So, we love the long tail, but we make most of our revenue in the head, because of the math of the power law.  Last month Google followed through by partnering with Sony and Universal Music Group to launch Vevo, the YouTube-based site for music videos (currently available in the US, Canada, and Japan only). The videos on the site are encoded to prevent downloading. They are surrounded by ads. They are removed from the YouTube APIs so that third-party applications can\u0026rsquo;t access them [link]. It\u0026rsquo;s a closed site based on closed technology - so much for Google\u0026rsquo;s commitment to openness as announced a week or two later [link]. But then, Google had little choice, given where its advertising money comes from.\nThe Vevo venture is extreme, but the same principle applies to other material on YouTube: the more Google extends its advertising throughout the site, the more it accepts the role of content cop, tracking down and removing material that is accused of breaking, the terms of copyright.\nThe issue goes beyond YouTube: here is Google\u0026rsquo;s claim that it can\u0026rsquo;t be held to blame if its image search algorithms give top ranking to an offensive picture of Michelle Obama:\nSometimes Google search results from the Internet can include disturbing content, even from innocuous queries. We assure you that the views expressed by such sites are not in any way endorsed by Google. Search engines are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the Internet. A site's ranking in Google's search results relies heavily on computer algorithms using thousands of factors to calculate a page's relevance to a given query.  Or, \u0026ldquo;what me guv? I\u0026rsquo;m just the postman.\u0026rdquo; But obviously Google can and does filter its image results by other criteria - it has a \u0026ldquo;safe search\u0026rdquo; option that excludes pornography but does not exclude racist images - and those criteria themselves are not chosen algorithmically.\nIs Openness the Solution?\nThe advertising model is currently driving all before it when it comes to the Web, but while Google, Facebook and others will try to play both sides of the game, in the end you can\u0026rsquo;t be both a common carrier and a successful ad-driven company.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s defense of \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not me, its my algorithms\u0026rdquo; will be challenged at some point, and Google will either have to take responsibility for the content it delivers, or forego revenue. But maybe there is a third option, which is to open up the algorithms themselves. Right now, Google expects us to take on trust what it can and cannot do, but that defense won\u0026rsquo;t last for long, particularly because of the barriers to entry for large-scale search and content hosting. One bargain it may be able to strike would be to keep both its common carrier role and its ability to make money off advertising, but to lower the barriers to entry for competitors by opening up its code and its data centre architecture. Despite its vaunted commitment to openness, Google won\u0026rsquo;t do this without a struggle, but maybe it will if it provides a way out of the common carrier dilemma.\n","date":1262528693,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4b1b061ce7e6cc1a31fb1f7020f75ee5","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-web-20-dilemma-profit-and-liability-go-together/","publishdate":"2010-01-03T14:24:53Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-web-20-dilemma-profit-and-liability-go-together/","section":"post","summary":"Google and other Web 2.0 companies have a problem: like it or not, profit and liability go together when it comes to delivering content.

Personally I\u0026rsquo;m not that interested in Pierre Trudeau, but apparently a lot of other people are, and Paul Wells of Macleans reviews the latest biography by John English called We’re Still Watching and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more. I feel pretty good at being in that company.\nOne of the nice things about LRC is that you get over 2000 words, so you can do an essay not just a summary of the book\u0026rsquo;s contents. Here are some excerpts from the first few paragraphs to give a sense of where it goes:\nThe global supply chain digs shale from the hostile terrain of Northern Alberta, refines it, ships it half way round the world and back again, and in the process turns it into thousands of distinct consumer items, from dollar store plastic sharks to laptop computers. Some see this continual transformation of the world's raw materials into things that consumers can use as a Hayekian cornucopia...Others see something more sinister at work...Both pictures have some truth. Nothing can be this massive without having multiple faces, but Gordon Laird definitely leans towards the \"sinister\" camp. While he does note that \"the supply chain has brought us many gifts\", he is more concerned that it has done so with \"a global legacy of unresolved problems\": environmental horrors in the backwaters of rural Asia, unregulated emissions of shipping fleets in the world's oceans, conflict and oppression of the labour force in China, global warming.   But, argues Laird, the era of the global supply chain is almost over. We have gone on our spending binge, and now we must face the hangover. As the environmental consequences of lax standards come home to roost, as sources of cheap energy, cheap credit, and even cheap labour threaten to dry up, we are nearing the death of globalization. \"The golden age of affordable consumerism was short. We will very likely never shop this hard again\". ... \"Our bargain-addicted consumer economy is dangerously leveraged on a series of innovations and inventions not built to last. Specifically, the fundamentals of growth - cheap credit, offshore labour, affordable energy, and transport - will be depleted or become unavailable during the twenty-first century\". He is not alone: ex-CIBC economist Jeff Rubin and John Ralston Saul both broadly share his opinion about the future of global trade, which is that there will be less of it, and that it will leave many difficult problems in its wake.   Gordon Laird ... starts by browsing with us through piles of cheap consumer goods at Las Vegas trade shows for discount stores, then takes us to Shenzen in China where many of the goods are made, shows us around the port of Los Angeles where a never-ending stream of standardized containers flows off the ships and onto trucks, and flies us back to the very beginning of the chain, to the muskeg of northern Alberta where the largest industrial project on the planet is run with Wal-Mart-like precision to extract oil from tar sands. He also ventures to the Mexico-US border to track the migration of workers driven by the shifting labour patterns of globalization. He supplements this field work with wide reading (his list of sources is 25 pages long and contains about 400 items) and a good selection of interviews. The _Price of a Bargain_ is a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on global trade, its impact, and its future.   But while Laird's willingness to travel and read is obvious, the book would be better if he had sat longer, alone and quiet, to distil the complexity he presents into a coherent picture. As it is, his portrayal is confusing and sometimes contradictory. The book is strong on data, weak on synthesis. ...

One was in Wired Magazine and one was in the New York Times., and each focused on one outstanding problem that the competitors faced. Wired looked at the quirkiness of users as they rate movies, and the NYT focused on the difficulty of predicting ratings for a handful of divisive movies.\nNow that the contest is over we can answer the question, “were those problems solved?”\nLet’s start with the Wired article. Entitled “This Psychologist Might Outsmart the Math Brains Competing for the Netflix Prize” [link] it interviewed Gavin Potter, aka “Just a guy in a garage”. Here’s the hook:\n   The computer scientists and statisticians at the top of the leaderboard have developed elaborate and carefully tuned algorithms for representing movie watchers by lists of numbers, from which their tastes in movies can be estimated by a formula. Which is fine, in Gavin Potter's view — except people aren't lists of numbers and don't watch movies as if they were.    Potter is focusing on effects like the Kahneman-Tversky anchoring effect:\n   If a customer watches three movies in a row that merit four stars — say, the Star Wars trilogy — and then sees one that's a bit better — say, Blade Runner — they'll likely give the last movie five stars. But if they started the week with one-star stinkers like the Star Wars prequels, Blade Runner might get only a 4 or even a 3. Anchoring suggests that rating systems need to take account of inertia — a user who has recently given a lot of above-average ratings is likely to continue to do so. Potter finds precisely this phenomenon in the Netflix data; and by being aware of it, he's able to account for its biasing effects and thus more accurately pin down users' true tastes.    Well Potter didn’t win, but did these kind of ideas help when it came to the winning submission? The answer is yes. The winning teams worked these kind of patterns, which are independent of particular user-movie combinations, into their models through the bland name of “baseline predictors”.\nAny model has to predict ratings that individual users will give for particular movies. A very simple baseline predictor could take the average of all the ratings for that movie, take the average of all ratings given by the user in question, and split the difference. So if the movie has an average rating of 3.45 and the user has rated all the movies he/she/they have watched with an average of 2.55, then the model would predict a rating of 3. This includes some minimal level of user-quirkiness (are they a high or low rater?), some level of information about the movie (is it rated highly or not?) yet has nothing to say about how this particular user is expected to react to this particular movie.\nIn their winning submission, the BellKor team [PDF link] list their major improvements in the final year of the competition, and the first item they give is improved baseline predictors. In particular,\n   Much of the temporal variability in the data is included within the baseline predictors, through two major temporal effects. The first addresses the fact that an item’s popularity may change over time. For example, movies can go in and out of popularity as triggered by external events such as the appearance of an actor in a new movie. This is manifested in our models by treating the item bias as a function of time. The second major temporal effect allows users to change their baseline ratings over time. For example, a user who tended to rate an average movie “4 stars”, may now rate such a movie “3 stars”. This may reflect several factors including a natural drift in a user’s rating scale, the fact that ratings are given in the context of other ratings that were given recently and also the fact that the identity of the rater within a household can change over time…     It was brought to our attention by our colleagues at the Pragmatic Theory team (PT) that the number of ratings a user gave on a specific day explains a significant portion of the variability of the data during that day.    A model with these variations, and no specific user-movie considerations (i.e., one that is useless for presenting a list of recommendations to a user) actually ends up being significantly more accurate than Netflix’s own Cinematch algorithm was at the beginning of the competition.\nSo score one for the winners – they solved the user-quirkiness problem.\nThe second article was in the New York Times and was called “If You Liked This, You’re Sure to Love That” [link]. Its focus was not the quirkiness of users, but unpredictable movies. Author Clive Thompson interviewed Len Bertoni, a leading contestant:\n   The more Bertoni improved upon Netflix, the harder it became to move his number forward. This wasn’t just his problem, though; the other competitors say that their progress is stalling, too, as they edge toward 10 percent. Why?     Bertoni says it’s partly because of “Napoleon Dynamite,” an indie comedy from 2004 that achieved cult status and went on to become extremely popular on Netflix. It is, Bertoni and others have discovered, maddeningly hard to determine how much people will like it. When Bertoni runs his algorithms on regular hits like “Lethal Weapon” or “Miss Congeniality” and tries to predict how any given Netflix user will rate them, he’s usually within eight-tenths of a star. But with films like “Napoleon Dynamite,” he’s off by an average of 1.2 stars…     And while “Napoleon Dynamite” is the worst culprit, it isn’t the only troublemaker. A small subset of other titles have caused almost as much bedevilment among the Netflix Prize competitors. When Bertoni showed me a list of his 25 most-difficult-to-predict movies, I noticed they were all similar in some way to “Napoleon Dynamite” — culturally or politically polarizing and hard to classify, including “I Heart Huckabees,” “Lost in Translation,” “Fahrenheit 9/11,” “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,” “Kill Bill: Volume 1” and “Sideways.”     So this is the question that gently haunts the Netflix competition, as well as the recommendation engines used by other online stores like Amazon and iTunes. Just how predictable is human taste, anyway? And if we can’t understand our own preferences, can computers really be any better at it?    The reason Napoleon Dynamite is a problem is not because it’s the most difficult movie to predict – it isn’t – but because it’s difficult to predict and it was rated by a lot of people. A movie that is difficult to predict but which is rated by only a handful of users will contribute very little to the total error in a model.\nWell, now the competition is done, the complete data set and the predictions of the winning submission are available for download [link], so download them I did, loaded them into a SQL Anywhere database, and graphed the results. Here is a plot of the remaining error for each movie against the total number of ratings for that movie, for all 17770 movies. Napoleon Dynamite is the red dot.\n\nWith 116,362 ratings, Napoleon Dynamite has a higher error than any other movie rated more than 50,000 times. I’s RMSE is 1.1934: just as bad as it was for Len Bertoni when the original article was written.\nSo there you go: user quirkiness was resolved, at least the the extent that was needed to win the prize, while quirky movies remained stubbornly unpredictable till the end.\n","date":1256504984,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"ebcf354b2e43b072fd1fba9e7dbcd267","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/netflix-prize-was-the-napoleon-dynamite-problem-solved/","publishdate":"2009-10-25T21:09:44Z","relpermalink":"/post/netflix-prize-was-the-napoleon-dynamite-problem-solved/","section":"post","summary":"I just gave a talk at work on “Recommender Systems and the Netflix Prize”, and included the two major popular articles about the prize in its final year or so.

More often than not, the end result is additional confusion, because the thing they are talking about (Chris Anderson’s book) defines the concept in many different ways, depending on what the author feels like talking about at the moment.\nThe latest is a working paper called Is Tom Cruise Threatened: Using Netflix Prize Data to Examine the Long Tail of Electronic Commerce, by Tom Tan and Serguei Netessine of the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania [PDF, summarized here]. It got slashdotted here, written up in The Register here, and Chris Anderson responds to it here.\nHere is what the paper does. It takes the sample of 100 million DVD ratings provided by Netflix for the recently-completed Netflix Prize, and breaks down the trends in ratings from 2000, when Netflix stocked relatively small numbers of titles and had relatively few users, to 2005 when Netflix had many more DVD titles and many more users. Then they ask whether demand for “hit movies” and “niche movies” increased or decreased over that time, as reflected in the number of ratings in Netflix’s sample data set. Not surprisingly, they notice that when measured absolutely (top 10, top 100) the demand for hits decreases and when measured in percentage terms (top 1%, top 10%) it increases.\nThe problem is that the Netflix Prize data set, while fascinating to explore, has nothing to say about the long tail by itself. Between 2000 and 2005 the DVD as a format exploded, with many old titles getting put on the new format, and Netflix exploded as the convenience of online movie rental took off. But comparing early Netflix to late Netflix doesn’t tell us anything at all about the evolution of consumer taste in the online world, or about the relative diversity of demand from online and ‘bricks and mortar’ stores, which is supposed to be what this is all about.\nTo be charitable, the nearest we can get is that it’s a comparison of a restricted set of choices (2000) and a broad set of choices (2005), but given that the size of the available set of titles increased by a factor of about 5 while the user base increased by a factor of 50, interpreting the results as “the effect on demand of this increase in variety [of titles]”, as Anderson does, is simply seeing what you’d like to see.\nIf we are going to take Anderson seriously then we should adopt his standard definition when the long tail gets challenged:\n   This is a good moment to remind everyone of the normal definition of \"head\" and \"tail\" in entertainment markets such as music. \"Head\" is the selection available in the largest bricks-and-mortar retailer in the market (that would be Wal-Mart in this case). \"Tail\" is everything else, most of which is only available online, where there is unlimited shelf space. [[link](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/06/excellent-hbr-p.html)]    It’s a definition that is skewed to guarantee success for his model, and which is completely uninteresting (as I have posted about ad nauseam) but hey, it’s his definition. And the Netflix data has nothing to say about it.\nSo when Chris Anderson posts his favourite graph from the data and claims it’s a vindication of the long tail (“Netflix data shows shifting demand down the Long Tail”), it can only be because it looks like the schematic, unlabelled, number-free graphs in his book. It’s cherry picking the data for the most simplistic of reasons because the two lines he’s comparing have no relation to what he talks about elsewhere, but hey, who cares?\n","date":1253876646,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"50e6f3252911f397486a08844b58edbb","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/more-long-tail-everyone-is-still-wrong/","publishdate":"2009-09-25T11:04:06Z","relpermalink":"/post/more-long-tail-everyone-is-still-wrong/","section":"post","summary":"Every now and then another study comes out about the long tail and gets discussed in the usual places.

He\u0026rsquo;s obviously thought hard about the conflicts (privacy) and opportunities (advertising) that arise when people provide their identity to online services, and about what kind of regulation may be needed to ensure those services behave responsibly with the data they collect. After all, as he says:\nIn the past, we have regulated intermediaries at these transactional bottlenecks - banks, cable companies, phone companies and the like - and limited the ways in which they can use the information that they see. Presumably the same forces that animated those rules - fundamental concerns about customer privacy - need to be assessed for our new information intermediaries.  In introducing the topic of advertising, Picker makes the standard point that \u0026ldquo;Ads in these [traditional] media are targeted to rough demographics. The Internet, in contrast, promises advertising matched to me\u0026rdquo;. And this, he claims, is a good thing: \u0026ldquo;Think about TV advertising and how many ads that you see for products that you never consume. Those ads are almost all wasted. Behavioral advertising [ie, personalized, online advertising] offers the promise of tailoring ads to individual consumers greatly increasing the efficiency of each ad dollar spent\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd then it clicked. I\u0026rsquo;d never realised it before, but the assumption that accurate advertising is better for me than inaccurate advertising is completely wrong. 180 degrees wrong. The truth is that accurate, targeted advertising is not a good thing, it\u0026rsquo;s a terrible thing.\nTo be slightly more nuanced, there are two kinds of ads in the world: listings and intrusions (I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are better names out there, but that\u0026rsquo;s all I can think of), and while accurate listings are OK, accurate intrusions are a terrible thing, because they intrude more effectively.\nListings are ads that I seek out: If I\u0026rsquo;m looking to buy a second-hand chest of drawers I\u0026rsquo;ll look in the back of the local paper, or on Craigslist or on Kijiji, and here I want to be able to find what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for, just like Randal Picker says. An ad for a car is no use if I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a chest of drawers. if I were looking for a job I\u0026rsquo;d want ads that match my skills and interests. So when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about listings, accuracy is good.\nBut then there are all those ads that you try to ignore, because they work by getting in your way when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking to buy anything at all. TV ads, radio ads (thank heavens for the CBC), some newspaper and magazine ads are all intrusions. They work by intruding into something else that you\u0026rsquo;re doing and catching your attention. And what I want from these ads is for them to be as obviously wrong and inaccurate as possible, because then I know I can ignore them safely. The more inaccurate they are, the less they drag at my attention, and the less likely they are to pull me away from what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do. More accurate ads are a more effective distraction. And while that may be good for the advertiser, and even for the owner of the delivery medium, it\u0026rsquo;s bad for me.\nThis is not some fancy rhetorical point - it\u0026rsquo;s actually how I experience newspapers and the Internet, and I suspect you do too.\nThink about Adwords. When you carry out a search, you don\u0026rsquo;t want the advertised listings, you want the \u0026ldquo;honest\u0026rdquo;, unpurchased listings. Try it yourself. If you are interested in finding out more about the subject of this post you may google online advertising. Do you want any of those listings down the right hand side? No you don\u0026rsquo;t. Do you want to go to those top three advertised links? No you don\u0026rsquo;t. Fortunately, they are all pretty much obviously outfits you don\u0026rsquo;t want anything to do with and you can easily ignore them. But if they were closer to what you were really interested in, you\u0026rsquo;d have to look over them, wonder whether to click them, decide whether to discard them or not. It\u0026rsquo;s all effort and attention and I\u0026rsquo;m lazy enough that I really don\u0026rsquo;t need it. The closer those ads are to what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for, the more distracting they are, and the more effort it is to drag my eyes away from them to the results I actually want.\nFortunately, despite the promises of individually targeted ads that know my inner desires and motivations, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about them becoming too accurate to ignore in the near future. After all, right now all we get is weight loss ads on Facebook and everywhere else and everyone gets to see those.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t miss much. It was a precis of Clay Shirky\u0026rsquo;s book Here Comes Everybody (my views on that are here), about how the Internet is dramatically enhancing our abilities to cooperate, collaborate, share, join and do all kinds of groupy things, prefaced by a few paragraphs in which he tried to claim that this groupiness is \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo;. In that it\u0026rsquo;s social, or something. KK doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care if it\u0026rsquo;s socialism or not of course, but using the word in the pages of a Condé Nast-owned publication sounds daring and provocative, so why not? And what else would you expect from someone who calls himself \u0026ldquo;Senior Maverick at Wired Magazine\u0026rdquo; [link]? (In the comments section of the first link of the following paragraph, Seth Finkelstein says all this more energetically.)\nLaw professor Lawrence Lessig took umbrage at the dread word, because \u0026ldquo;at the core of socialism is coercion\u0026rdquo; so \u0026ldquo;I will never agree to call what millions have voluntarily created on the Net \u0026lsquo;socialism.\u0026rsquo; That term insults the creators, and confuses the rest.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t read his posts when they first came out either, so I missed the sentence \u0026ldquo;No one forces Wikipedia editors to build a free encyclopedia\u0026rdquo;, which is close enough to a certain book title to catch my eye.\nBut I did see Henry Farrell\u0026rsquo;s fine post, calling Lessig\u0026rsquo;s arguments \u0026ldquo;a horrible, horrible mess\u0026rdquo;:\n\"Item one: under Lessig’s definition, when the Young Socialists League of the Socialisty Socialists of America organizes its volunteer commune in Ann Arbor, this commune isn’t a socialistic one, because no-one is being forced to join. Item two – that if you are to deplore your critics for having mysteriously misinterpreted you as associating coercion with Stalin, you probably shouldn’t have been arsing on about Stalin, collective farms _und so weiter_ in your original post. This class of rhetorical maneuver is what we call running with the hare and coursing with the hounds in the country where I grew up.\"    This sent be back to the original articles, which I read with increasing irritation. I\u0026rsquo;m eagerly awaiting Henry Farrell\u0026rsquo;s promised longer post on the subject, but there\u0026rsquo;s no sign of it yet. So as a substitute here\u0026rsquo;s what gets me pissed off about the Lessig/Kelly debate.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not what they disagree about that annoys me. Is this socialism or is this just love? At some point the label doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter: you say tomayto and I say tomahto, a rose by any other name, sticks and stones, etc.\nNo, it\u0026rsquo;s what they agree on that drives me spare. The idea that the technological innovation surrounding the Internet is a transformative social movement and, what\u0026rsquo;s more, a political movement in the broad sense. LL and KK ascribe explicit political consequences to open source software, the hacker ethos, Wikipedia, and so on. They adopt and share with others an implicit belief in technological determinism, in which new technology is inherently linked to a particular kind of progressive and liberating social change. Clay Shirky is another who looks at the world this way:\n\"The internet’s output is data, but its product is freedom, lots and lots of freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of association, the freedom of an unprecedented number of people to say absolutely anything they like at any time, with the reasonable expectation that those utterances will be globally available, broadly discoverable at no cost, and preserved for far longer than most utterances are, and possibly forever.\" [[link](http://many.corante.com/archives/2007/07/09/andrew_keen_rescuing_luddite_from_the_luddites.php)]    KK calls the development of open source and social software \u0026ldquo;an alternative to capitalism and corporatism\u0026rdquo;, and LL sees the debate in explicitly political terms:\n... sloppiness here has serious political consequences. When a founder of the movement which we all now celebrate calls this movement \"socialist,\" that plays right in the hand of those would attack everything this movement has built.    Here\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\nThis rhetoric of liberation has led many a talented and idealistic young person to believe that coding, especially for free, is a political statement. In the guise of an anti-establishment, scrappy, can-do underdog attitude, LL, KK and their colleagues have created an environment in which well-intentioned people really believe that the commercialization of friendship by Facebook is a democratizing force, that it\u0026rsquo;s progressive for technology entrepreneurs to make billions from the work of artists who get nothing, and that posting book reviews on Amazon and movie reviews on Amazon-owned IMDB is contributing to a public good. In which otherwise intelligent people believe that Google and Twitter are somehow morally different from Microsoft and Wal-Mart because their employees are younger and because they use phrases like \u0026ldquo;radical transparency\u0026rdquo; without living up to them.\nSome of those young people have created great things. Others have been suckered into digital sharecropping efforts believing that they are doing something worthwhile, painting a fence for some Tom Sawyer with a venture capitalist behind him who makes a mint off their efforts. And others have become those rich young men (almost always men) with their private jets. As Time Magazine wrote in its portrait of Flickr founders Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield: \u0026ldquo;IPOs? Web 1.0. Building it and flipping it to Yahoo, Google or Microsoft? Web 2.0\u0026rdquo;.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s get some things clear.\n The Internet doesn\u0026rsquo;t have one product, it has many products. Some of which are wonderful and some of which are politically reactionary. It has produced some admirable and exciting cultural innovations, and it has also led to a huge influx of money to the pockets of Silicon Valley billionaires and away from proprietors and employees of small-scale, independent outfits that are vital to our cultural health.\n The Internet is not inherently anti-corporate and it is not anti-state. If you want to be part of an anti-corporate movement, simply doing your digital thing is not enough.\n Google is not an upstart. Anyone who can read their statement about making YouTube profitable and still think Google is run by coders, not bean counters, is kidding themselves.\n The open source \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo; is not a political movement and open source is not a political virtue. Open source is perfectly compatible with businesses as conservative as they come. The largest death machine on the planet has its own open source initiative [link]; anything key to IBM\u0026rsquo;s strategy is not an alternative to capitalism. Of course, Google says that in building its new Chrome OS on top of Linux \u0026ldquo;We have a lot of work to do, and we\u0026rsquo;re definitely going to need a lot of help from the open source community to accomplish this vision\u0026rdquo; [link]. So go ahead, help them, but don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;re doing something progressive.\n I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that the Internet is inherently reactionary, any more than it is inherently progressive. Political activists are spending a lot of time building digital tools to help maintain movements and promote worthwhile causes, to promote worthwhile goals, and these are useful activities. Even I use Drupal and CiviCRM for groups I am a member of. But let\u0026rsquo;s not think that these tools make this generation of activists materially different from previous generations. Elsewhere on this blog Phil Edwards (blog here) relayed a question he asked John Curtice: \u0026ldquo;has pervasive Internet access been a force for good in terms of expanding participation, i.e. were people who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t previously have been informed \u0026amp; involved using the Net to get informed \u0026amp; involved? His answer was, um, no, not really - political activism was a minority pursuit \u0026amp; always had been, and the Net hadn\u0026rsquo;t made it any less of one. Afterwards I asked the Shirky/Howard Dean question - had the Net been a negative influence, in that the frictionless ease of Net activism actually attracted people away from real-world politics? His answer was, um, no, not really - political activism was a minority pursuit \u0026amp; always had been, and in all probability the same minority were going to the physical meetings and joining the Facebook groups\u0026rdquo; [link].\n  Somehow the digirati choose to ignore the fact that the major media corporations they love to knock are doing just fine in the brand new world of the Internet - but then a Condé Nast publication may be expected to believe that. LL\u0026rsquo;s talk of a \u0026ldquo;hybrid economy\u0026rdquo; is filled with optimistic assumptions about the behaviour of the new corporations and breezy acceptance, even approval, of the fact that his young children\u0026rsquo;s everyday social interactions are now a legitimate target of advertisers. Even when a cool kid shows signs of disillusionment, as Boing Boing\u0026rsquo;s Cory Doctorow did recently, he wraps his claims in qualifiers:\nI sympathize with companies and creators who want to keep Google or Amazon from becoming gatekeepers on culture. Not because of who runs Amazon or Google -- I know senior people at both companies whom I believe to be honorable and decent -- but because no one should be that gatekeeper. I'd oppose consolidation in distribution and sales channels, even if the companies involved were Santa Claus Inc., Mahatma Gandhi Ltd., and Toothfairy Enterprises LLC. [[link](http://www.internetevolution.com/document.asp?doc_id=178058)]    Cory - you\u0026rsquo;re on the right track, but why would you think that the character of the people you know matters a damn? It certainly sounds like you think the \u0026ldquo;honorable and decent\u0026rdquo; nature of people at Google and Amazon ameliorates the impact of those companies. The problems with the mainstream institutions you have so little time for are nothing to do with levels of honour and decency among their senior people. This is not a matter of good guys and bad guys. As someone who knew a bit about socialism once said \u0026ldquo;In the social production of their existence, men [and women too] inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [the] relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not anti-technology. But it\u0026rsquo;s time to think about the Internet and digital technology in the same way that we think of the road system or other pieces of our social infrastructure. It would be ludicrous to claim that roads have one product. I just watched my son drive off with a car full of friends to a weekend at a cottage - a form of freedom possible only because of the technology of the road. But I worry a little, as any parent does, because roads are dangerous places too (as a scar on forehead from when I was eight years old reminds me). Few people are pro- or anti-road in general any more; instead the interesting questions are about how to make the most of the benefits roads can bring and how to limit the damage they can cause. The same goes for the Internet: let\u0026rsquo;s not assume its progressive nature, let\u0026rsquo;s not assume that everyone working in an open source manner or building new technologies is somehow on the same side, let\u0026rsquo;s appreciate those who are building progressive spaces on the Internet because they are progressive spaces, not because they are on the Internet.\n","date":1248003466,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0af665943516b0292a465740f8887d0c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/wikibollocks-lawrence-lessigkevin-kelly-edition/","publishdate":"2009-07-19T11:37:46Z","relpermalink":"/post/wikibollocks-lawrence-lessigkevin-kelly-edition/","section":"post","summary":"I don\u0026rsquo;t usually read Wired so I didn\u0026rsquo;t see Kevin Kelly\u0026rsquo;s article called \u0026ldquo;The New Socialism: Global Collectivist Society is Coming Online\u0026rdquo;.

The same girl, searching on Overture, will encounter a commodity toy\u0026rdquo;.\nBut that was in 2006. Since then things have changed in the google-sphere. I posted about this 18 months ago in Barbie slinks back to the confines of feminist-criticism symposia. Here were the Google first page results from 2006 as reported by Benkler:\nbarbie.com\nBarbie Collecter\nAdiosBarbie.com\nBarbie Bazaar\nIf You Were a Barbie, Which Messed Up Version would you be?\nVisible Barbie project (macabre images\u0026hellip;)\nBarbie: The Image of us all (1995 undergraduate paper)\nAndigraph.free.fre (Barbie and Ken sex animation)\nSuicide bomber Barbie\nBarbies (dressed and painted as countercultural images)\nand here were the results in January 2008:\nBarbie.com - Activities and Games for Girls Online!

Clicking the top link takes you to a pink page with \u0026ldquo;Think Pink\u0026rdquo; written in the middle of it, and the majority of the sites feature pink prominently. No more defining the cultural symbols of our day for you, nine-year-old girl! Quit the self-aware political discourse and get back to dressing that doll in gender-appropriate colours (as selected for you by Mattel).\u0026rdquo;\nEvery now and again I google barbie and see what\u0026rsquo;s changed as the Google search engine becomes more elaborate. So here are today\u0026rsquo;s results (from southern Ontario).\nBarbie.com - Activities and Games for Girls Online! (together with eight other links to My Scene, Evertythingggirl, Polly Pocket, Kellyclub, and so on).\nBarbie.com - Fun and Games\nBarbie - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nNews results for barbie (with several other links)\nBarbie Collector - (The official Mattel site for Barbie Collector)\nBarbie.co.uk - Activities and Games for Girls Online!\nBarbie.ca\nBarbie Girls - and a sublink\nCelebrate 50 Years of Barbie\nVideo results for barbie - with two links to Aqua\u0026rsquo;s Barbie Girl video\nSearches related to barbie - all strictly orthodox except for one about Taiwanese actress and singer Barbie Xu.\nYes, the little girl who searches for Barbie on Google will now encounter a commodity toy.\nThe one big change in the last 18 months is that the remaining countercultural site from 2008 has now been pushed over the edge to page 2 of the search results, displaced by two Google-owned collections of links (News and Videos). I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve seen this in your own searches. Google presents more links on and around the \u0026ldquo;top ten\u0026rdquo; results, in \u0026ldquo;related searches\u0026rdquo;, and in collections of video, news, and image links. One effect of this change is that Google now often gets one more click from you before you leave their domain. Google is extending its role from pointing you vaguely towards your destination to guiding you more precisely, and more profitably, all the way along the path.\nOf the other top-level links, seven are owned by Mattel (Two to barbie.com, Barbie collector, Barbie Girls, barbie.co.uk, barbie.ca, Celebrate 50 years of Barbie) and the remaining link is to Wikipedia, now the only non-commercial site on the front page. Following Nick Carr\u0026rsquo;s informal experiment we may have expected Wikipedia to move even higher in the results, but it has just held its place.\nIndependent sites are out there in their millions of course, but they are unfortunately being pushed to the periphery of our field of vision by commercial efforts - of Mattel in this case. It should be no surprise that as the web has become mainstream, and as corporations realise the necessity of investing in their web presence, the web begins to look more like other mainstream media. Perhaps more evidence that the Web\u0026rsquo;s counter-cultural moment is over.\n ","date":1246661225,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5f21a7d84f51f75bb39bd62f7bd2c413","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/googling-barbie-again/","publishdate":"2009-07-03T22:47:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/googling-barbie-again/","section":"post","summary":"My writer\u0026rsquo;s block has writer\u0026rsquo;s block.

But now the boot is on the other foot and it looks like even core economic observations may be better explained by other social sciences. Robert Solow apparently said that attempts to explain differences in economic growth across countries typically end in \u0026ldquo;a blaze of amateur sociology\u0026rdquo;. The focus on psychology in explanations of the banking crash shows that growth is not the only area of economics where the discipline runs out of steam before reaching its destination. The rise of behavioural economics, surely a last-gasp attempt by economists to match their models to the real world without changing departments, suggests that the condition goes deep.\nDespite its title, Hayagreeva Rao\u0026rsquo;s Market Rebels (Open Library link, publisher\u0026rsquo;s page) challenges the economic analysis of innovations. At 180 pages and full of case studies it\u0026rsquo;s easy to read quickly, but I was so taken by it that I went through it a second time and found much that I had missed. Rao does not hammer the reader over the head with the implications of his case studies, but for me as a non-sociologist and non-economist the implications are huge and I\u0026rsquo;ll be thinking about the book for a long time.\nThe case studies are diverse, but are centered around a single claim: the \u0026ldquo;joined hands of activists\u0026rdquo; play an important part in the creation, diffusion, and blocking of innovations. Collective action matters. Rao describes how hobbyists were key to the cultural acceptance of the car and the development of the personal computer; how microbrewers brought diversity back to beer; how nouvelle cuisine grew from the rebellious student movements of Paris 1968; how shareholder activism has pushed large companies to change behaviours; how community activists attempted to stall the spread of chain stores and then of big-box stores; how the green movement blocked the development of biotechnology in Europe. These studies, many based on his own research, help to bring activist groups and their campaigns out from the wings and into the spotlight as we think about innovation and social change, and by doing so Rao is performing a valuable service.\nThe book is not strong on systematic analysis. The closest he gets to describing what determines whether movements succeed or fail is that successful movements must create \u0026ldquo;hot causes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cool mobilizations\u0026rdquo;. Both concepts are tied in to the concept of \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo;, which for Rao is the underlying motive that causes people to join with or against social movements. A \u0026ldquo;hot cause\u0026rdquo; is the spark that successful activists use to light a fire. It\u0026rsquo;s a lightning-rod incident or issue that arouses strong emotions such as pride or anger. Examples include the frustrated demonization of \u0026ldquo;big beer\u0026rdquo; by real ale enthusiasts; the outrageous bonus paid to Home Depot CEO Robert Nardelli which crystallized the shareholder rights movement. But \u0026ldquo;hot causes\u0026rdquo; by themselves are not enough for a prolonged campaign. \u0026ldquo;Cool mobilizations\u0026rdquo; are actions that keep a movement going forward by \u0026ldquo;engaging audiences in new behaviors and new experiences that are improvisational and insurgent\u0026rdquo;. Examples include setting up a microbrewery or formulating shareholder resolutions. The concepts are useful, but it\u0026rsquo;s a shame Rao doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a stronger turn of phrase. Naming concepts can be key to owning them, and \u0026ldquo;hot cause\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cool mobilization\u0026rdquo; are too literal and clumsy to take on the weight they need. But this is a detail (and I don\u0026rsquo;t have better ideas).\nFor someone who has spent most of their non-fiction reading time reading economics and economics-inspired books in recent years, Rao\u0026rsquo;s is a welcome and refreshing change. Economic analysis too-often reduces the political left-right split to the false dichotomy of market vs state, but this reduction maps badly on to the real experience of political activism. Those who protest Monsanto\u0026rsquo;s private-sector use of genetic engineering are often the same as those who protest state-driven wars. Many of those who oppose new Wal-Mart stores also oppose the extension of surveillance powers by the state. Where do such activists see themselves in a market vs state debate? For many, they don\u0026rsquo;t: market vs state is not what it\u0026rsquo;s about. So it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that economists have a blind spot when it comes to social movements, and that the discipline systematically minimizes their impact. By putting social movements at the centre of his stories, Rao shows that they can and do have an influence, and that they deserve a place in any serious look at institutions that shape social change.\nAlthough he says almost nothing about the Internet and digital collaboration, Market Rebels\u0026rsquo; focus on innovations makes the book obviously relevant. Rao\u0026rsquo;s analysis is a welcome alternative to the usual focus of widely-read writers like Yochai Benkler and Clay Shirky. These writers take the economics point of view and focus on issues such information as a public good, lowering transaction costs for online exchanges, and the vanishingly small marginal cost of reproduction of digital information. Rao\u0026rsquo;s unspoken counterargument, which convinces me, is that group formation is not a problem of information, it\u0026rsquo;s a problem of identity. If he is right then although we can expect to see many examples of successful groups in the online world, we won\u0026rsquo;t see not a huge flowering of groupiness compared to the information-starved analogue world.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, if Rao is right and initiatives such as Wikipedia, blogging and the Open Source movement really are social movements, then they may have a limited lifespan. Digital activist identity is a rebellious and anti-establishement stance, but such a stance can only be maintained while the movement is oppositional. Open Source, with a longer history behind it than Wikipedia or blogging, has changed its identity to being more professionalized, more establishment. Its participants are less likely to be the radicals of yesteryear. Once Wikipedia is established as a success for a few years, rebellion becomes irrelevant as a motive and one may wonder whether the activists will find the \u0026ldquo;cool mobilizations\u0026rdquo; to maintain involvement and participation.\nIf there is an economics tie-in with Rao\u0026rsquo;s analysis, it\u0026rsquo;s with the analysis of identity pioneered by Rachel Kranton and Robert Akerlof (and which I sketched in the final chapter of No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart). Rao does little to pick apart the concept of identity and it looks to me like the K\u0026amp;A analysis would have been helpful to him. For Kranton and Akerlof, identity is a set of social categories (car enthusiast, green activist), a set of prescriptions that go along with those categories, and a set of costs and benefits associated with following or not following these prescriptions. We each choose an identity from the range that society provides (\u0026ldquo;environmentalist\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo;, etc). Forcing this choice is the object behind Rao\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;hot cause\u0026rdquo;: the lightning-rod issue that polarizes participants into supporters and opponents (\u0026ldquo;which side are you on, boys, which side are you on?\u0026rdquo;, as the greatest living American sings). Once you have chosen an identity, you must affirm it by following the prescriptions associated with that identity (shopping at independent stores, eating nouvelle cuisine, etc) or you pay the price of dissonance if you take actions that go against those prescriptions (shopping at W al-Mart, eating classical cuisine). Creating a strong set of such prescriptions is the essence of Rao\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;cool mobilizations\u0026rdquo;, which serve to maintain a sense of solidarity and identity among movement members.\nOne of the more common criticisms of No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart was that, although I argued in favour of collective action as a corrective force to free markets, I had little to say about what forms that action should take. It\u0026rsquo;s a fair knock, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy that I can now point such readers to Rao\u0026rsquo;s book. Not only does he take on several of the issues that I cover (Wal-Mart and big-box stores, biotechnology, real ale) but he takes them much further than I could ever had done, and in a wonderfully specific and constructive way that provides concrete guidance to activists. I take my hat off to him.\n","date":1245591466,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1c99f97f026a517e70940f69a1a1804e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/raos-market-rebels-a-review-1/","publishdate":"2009-06-21T13:37:46Z","relpermalink":"/post/raos-market-rebels-a-review-1/","section":"post","summary":"Market Rebels: How Activists Make or Break Radical Innovations, Hayagreeva Rao, Princeton University Press 2009\nFor decades, economists have extended their intellectual reach beyond mere money in an attempt to encompass all the social sciences in their analytical framework.

Oh I know you are a lot more attractive than Wal-Mart - younger, cooler, and with much better taste in office furniture. But underneath all the surface appearances you share the same hobbies and even the same values, so you\u0026rsquo;ll overcome any awkwardness pretty soon. Trust me, you\u0026rsquo;re birds of a feather.\nWhat hobbies? Well, you love to collect vast amounts of crap and then make it easy and cheap for people to get at it. And guess what? So does Wal-Mart. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, Wal-Mart isn\u0026rsquo;t in your league. He only gets crap from a small number of people compared to you. But he does have some great stories about making bargains. Just ask him to tell about the time he told Coca Cola to go back and redesign their Diet Coke recipe just for him - it\u0026rsquo;s hilarious.\nAnd you know that crowdsourcing thing you do, where you get other people to work for free because it\u0026rsquo;s fun? Well he\u0026rsquo;s pretty good at that too, except he does it with whole companies. Like, he gets deodorant companies to manage his deodorant shelves for him, so he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to! Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you love to pull a trick like that with NBC or Fox? Look, I know he wears crappy clothes, but he can be a hoot when he\u0026rsquo;s in the mood.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not too surprising that you have these things in common when you think about it. You\u0026rsquo;re both really good with technology and numbers to start with. And I heard some stories about you from Eric Clemons. Actually he was telling me that you remind him of airline customer reservation systems (CRSs) Sabre and Apollo. He told me that you come \u0026ldquo;between the shopper and the ultimate service provider (hotel, airline, retailer, or manufacturer), just as we saw in the case of the airline CRSs. The conditions are right for Google to enjoy enormous market power over service providers, who feel they must bid for positions in Google’s sponsored search keyword auctions.\u0026rdquo; Well that\u0026rsquo;s Wal-Mart to a tee.\nPlus, you and Wal-Mart both have a sense of mission - that you are acting on behalf of your customers and bargaining for them against these powerful institutions like Coca Cola or CBS. You know what Wal-Mart says? He says \u0026ldquo;There is only one boss. The customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else\u0026rdquo;. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the kind of thing you would say? Except you would be classier about it. You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t talk about anything as crass as money.\nSo you could learn a lot from Wal-Mart, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t just be a one-way conversation. I think you could tell Wal-Mart some pretty good stories too. There\u0026rsquo;s a thing you both do which I love. You\u0026rsquo;ve both got (I hope you don\u0026rsquo;t mind me saying) piles of money, but whenever someone asks you to pay for something you have this great way of showing your empty pockets - and they are always empty - and saying \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d love to, but I just can\u0026rsquo;t afford it. I\u0026rsquo;m nearly broke as it is\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a hoot! But you do it even better than Wal-Mart. His line is always that he makes only a penny or two on each sale so he\u0026rsquo;s nearly broke. Even he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the gall to say he makes nothing.\nYou should tell him the story about the musicians. You know the one. Where you got Billy Bragg and Robin Gibb to work together. Not singing together - that would be a thing - but writing a letter at least. They said that YouTube should pay artists a royalty when someone listens to a song, kind of like when radio broadcasters or TV stations do. And after paying $1.65 billion-with-a-B to buy YouTube from these guys, you just stood there with a straight face and said \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t afford it\u0026rdquo;. It was hilarious! What were your words? Oh yes, you cannot be expected to engage in a business in which you lose money every time a music video is played. And you got plenty of people to buy it as well even though you never said how much money you make on advertising. They think Billy Bragg is the privileged jerk and you\u0026rsquo;re the poor guy on the corner just trying to make a living and on the side of the little guy. Really, you\u0026rsquo;ve outdone Wal-Mart on this one.\nSo let me introduce you. Google, meet Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, meet Google.

But I don\u0026rsquo;t feel too guilty: if I was really trolling for traffic I could have called it \u0026ldquo;Learning from the Big Penis Book\u0026rdquo; [see Music Machinery for why].\nSecond, no matter how hard you try to be clear, many people don\u0026rsquo;t get what you are trying to say. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not their fault. For examples, see some of the comments here and here and even a bit here and on the original. The main complaint is that picking two example runs from a simplistic simulation of a small system with a small and fixed number of customers and products doesn\u0026rsquo;t simulate the entire Internet. Where is the statistical sampling, the exploration of the sensitivity to parameters, the validating of the recommendation model? And on and on.\nThese folks don\u0026rsquo;t get why people do simple models of complex things.\nThe goal of simulations is not always to reproduce reality as closely as possible. In fact, building a finely-tuned, elaborate model of a particular phenomenon actually gets in the way of finding generalizations, commonalities, and trends, because with an accurate model you cannot find commonalities.\nFor example (and I\u0026rsquo;m not comparing my little blog post to any of these people\u0026rsquo;s work), in chemistry, Roald Hoffmann got a Nobel Prize and may be the most influential theorist of his generation because he chose to use a highly simplified model of electronic structure (the extended Huckel model). It is well known that the extended Huckel model fails to include the most elementary features needed to reproduce a chemical bond. Yet Hoffman was able to use this simple model to identify and explain huge numbers of trends among chemical structures precisely because it leaves out so many complicating factors. Later work using more sophisticated models like ab initio computations and density functional methods let you do much more accurate studies of individual molecules, but it\u0026rsquo;s a lot harder to extract a comprehensible model of the broad factors at work.\nOr in economics, think of Paul Krugman\u0026rsquo;s description of an economy with two products (hot dogs and buns). Silly, but justifiably so. In fact, read that piece for a lovely explanation of why such a thought experiment is worthwhile.\nOr elsewhere in social sciences, think of Thomas Schelling\u0026rsquo;s explorations of selection and sorting in Micromotives and Macrobehaviour, or of Robert Axelrod\u0026rsquo;s brilliantly overreaching The Evolution of Cooperation, which built a whole set of theories on a single two-choice game and influenced a generation of political scientists in the process. All these efforts work precisely because they look at simple and even unrealistic models. That\u0026rsquo;s the only way you can capture mechanisms: general causes that lead to particular outcomes. More precise models would not improve these works - they would just obscure the insights.\nThat said, there are valid questions. Under some circumstances, aggregating large numbers of opinions into a single recommendation can give this odd combination of broader individual horizons and a narrower overall culture. Are there demonstrable cases of the monopoly populism model out there in the wild (aside from the big penis book)? Is this a common phenomenon or an uninteresting curiosity? Well I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I do think so, obviously, otherwise I would not have written the post. But it\u0026rsquo;s a hunch, a hypothesis, a suggestion, that I find intriguing and which I may or may not try to follow up.

Internet sharing mechanisms such as YouTube and Google PageRank, which distil the clicks of millions of people into recommendations, may also be promoting an online monoculture. Even word of mouth recommendations such as blogging links may exert a homogenizing pressure and lead to an online culture that is less democratic and less equitable, than offline culture.  Whenever I make these claims someone says \u0026ldquo;Well I use Netflix and it\u0026rsquo;s shown me all kinds of films I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about before. It\u0026rsquo;s broadened my experience, so that\u0026rsquo;s an increase in diversity.\u0026rdquo; And someone else points to the latest viral home video on YouTube as evidence of niche success.\nSo this post explains why your gut feel is wrong.\nThe argument comes from a paper by Daniel M. Fleder and Kartik Hosanagar called Blockbuster Culture\u0026rsquo;s Next Rise or Fall: The Impact of Recommender Systems on Sales Diversity. They simulate a number of different kinds of recommender system and look at how these systems affect the diversity of a set of choices. Towards the end of the paper they observe that some of their recommender systems increase the experience of diversity for every individual in the sample and yet decrease the overall diversity of the culture. So I wrote a program that does basically what they do in their paper and tweaked it to highlight this result.\nThe result is what\u0026rsquo;s important here, rather than the particular algorithm used to generate this instance of it. But I know some people will want to know how the results are generated, so I\u0026rsquo;ll give a short sketch. If you want more than this, Fleder and Hosanagar provide details, my tweaks to their model are available as source code (python) if you want, and if you post in the comments we could get into a discussion. But it\u0026rsquo;s not important, trust me.\nEach simulation starts with 48 customers and 48 products. Each product is described by two attributes, with values generated according to a normal distribution. So the products are distributed on a two-dimensional grid, with a value of about -3 to +3 along each axis. Each customer is assigned a taste for each attribute, so they also are scattered about in the same space. The idea is that a customer will prefer, other things being equal, a product that is close to it in these attributes. Here are two distributions of customers (blue) and products (red). You can see that most customers share a mainstream taste around the middle of the graph, but there are a few who have odd tastes off to the edges. Likewise, most products have attributes that are mainstream, but there are a few \u0026ldquo;niche\u0026rdquo; products closer to the edge. In this particular simulation, a customer can choose the same item over and over again, so it simulates something like streaming radio more than a bookstore. Each simulation starts off with a priming phase, in which each customer makes 75 choices according to a function which favours nearby products, but with some randomness so that they may on occasion choose one further away. After 75 choices we turn on a recommender function. Whenever a customer goes to make a choice, the recommender system identifies a product and recommends it to the customer. The recommendation increases the chance that the customer will choose the recommended product. Fleder and Hosanagar look at a few recommender functions. The one I use works like this:\n The set of 48 customers is divided into equal-sized communities, with members\u0026nbsp;chosen at random so they may not be close in taste.\n The recommender function chooses an item by looking at what customers in the same community have chosen. It recommends the one most popular among others in the community.\n  I\u0026rsquo;m just going to show you two simulations. Run 1 above - which I will call Internet World - treats the entire set of 48 customers as a single community. The other (run 28 above), which I will call Offline World, breaks it into 24 communities of two people each. In Offline World I will get recommendations from the people around me and you will get recommendations from the people around you, but these recommendations are separate and isolated. In Internet World we each get recommendations from all 48 customers.\nHere are the results for the two simulation runs I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on. The results of these simulations are far from the only possible outcome, but they show why the gut feeling may fail, and I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen them for that purpose.\nIn Internet World each customer experiences an average of 3.5 products over the course of 75 choices with an active recommender system, while in Offline World each customer experiences only 2.4 different products. So the wider set of people providing recommendations in Internet World has led to an increase in individual diversity. This is like saying that \u0026ldquo;Netflix shows me pictures I would never had heard about from my friends alone\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Amazon recommended a book I had never heard of, and I liked it\u0026rdquo;.\nOn the other hand, the overall diversity of the culture can be measured by the Gini coefficient of the products. A Gini coefficient of zero is complete equality (each product is chosen an equal number of times) and a Gini coefficient of 1 is complete inequality (only one product is ever chosen by anyone). And Internet World has a Gini of 0.79 while Offline World has a Gini of only 0.52. Internet World is less diverse than Offline World.\nHow can these seemingly contradictory results happen? Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look.\nIn the following graph, each dot is a customer, arranged in their two-attribute preference space (just like in the graphs above). But this time the area of each dot is proportional to the number of unique products they experience. So in Run 1 (Internet World) you can see that the dots are, on average, bigger than the dots in Run 28 (Offline World). This shows the greater individual experience of diversity in Internet World; for example, there is a customer with attributes of (1.1, -0.8) who samples no less than 38 different products, and only seven of the 48 customers stay with a single product throughout the whole simulation. Meanwhile in Offline World the most eclectic customer samples only nine and there are no fewer than 19 customers who sample just one product. The experience of individual customers in Internet World is of broader horizons and more selection, as recommendations pour in from far and wide, rather than from the limited experiences of their small community in Offline World. This picture has become the standard narrative of choice in the Internet World - our cultural experiences, liberated from the parochial tastes and limited awareness of those who happen to live close to us, are broadened by exposure to the wisdom of crowds, and the result is variety, diversity, and democratization. It is the age of the niche.\nBut wait!\nHere is a graph of the products in each simulation. This time, the area of each dot shows its popularity: how often a customer chooses it.\nYou can see that on the left, in Internet World, a few products were chosen a lot, especially the one centred on about (-0.2, -0.2). In Offline World there are many more medium-sized dots, showing that the consumption of products is more equal. In Internet World one product has \u0026ldquo;gone viral\u0026rdquo; and gets chosen over 1500 times out of the total of 3600, while 26 products languish in the obscurity of being sampled fewer than ten times. In Offline World no single product is chosen more than 10% of the time, and only 14 products are sampled fewer than ten times. In short, niche products do better in Offline World than in Internet World.\nWhile each customer on average experiences more unique products in Internet World, the recommender system generates a correlation among the customers. To use a geographical analogy, in Internet World the customers see further, but they are all looking out from the same tall hilltop. In Offline World individual customers are standing on different, lower, hilltops. They may not see as far individually, but more of the ground is visible to someone. In Internet World, a lot of the ground cannot be seen by anyone because they are all standing on the same big hilltop.\nThe end result is the Gini values mentioned before. Here are Lorentz curves for Internet World (blue) and Offline World (green), in which the products are lined up in order of increasing popularity along the x axis, and the cumulative choices for those products is plotted up the Y axis. So there it is. Individual diversity and cultural homogeneity coexisting in what we might call monopoly populism.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t think this is just about automated recommender systems, like the ones that Amazon and Netflix use. The recommender \u0026ldquo;system\u0026rdquo; could be anything that tends to build on its own popularity, including word of mouth. A couple of weeks ago someone pointed me to this video of Madin, a six-year-old soccer prodigy from Algeria, and the next day my son, who moves in very different online circles to me, was watching the same one. I know who Jim Cramer is even though we don\u0026rsquo;t get CNBC in Canada because everyone is talking about him and helping his disembodied head to shoot down Jon Stewart. More people watched Tina Fey being Sarah Palin online than on Saturday Night Live, and Fey is now famous in countries where no one watches the TV show. Clay Shirky writes an essay and I get five different links to it in my Google Reader feed in one morning. Our online experiences are heavily correlated, and we end up with monopoly populism.\nA \u0026ldquo;niche\u0026rdquo;, remember, is a protected and hidden recess or cranny, not just another row in a big database. Ecological niches need protection from the surrounding harsh environment if they are to thrive. Simply putting lots of music into a single online iTunes store is no recipe for a broad, niche-friendly culture.\n","date":1237125470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"3e417be452f380bdfc7dd79342f5dd9e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/online-monoculture-and-the-end-of-the-niche/","publishdate":"2009-03-15T13:57:50Z","relpermalink":"/post/online-monoculture-and-the-end-of-the-niche/","section":"post","summary":"Online merchants such as Amazon, iTunes and Netflix may stock more items than your local book, CD, or video store, but they are no friend to \u0026quot;niche culture\u0026quot;.

In the previous episode, Kylie and Edmund vanished from Whimsley Hall after finding out that Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s recommendations were doing nothing to help sell Kylie\u0026rsquo;s story The Adventures of Wazzock. Whimsley sunk into a brief depression before being roused by Jennie the one-legged housekeeper, who sent him into the village just in time to see Kylie and a pack of teenagers heading towards Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop with trouble on their minds.]\nI wrote the first ten episodes of this story in a couple of weeks around Christmas, when I had some time off work and the story seemed fresh and interesting. The two most recent episodes have been written on weekends in and around cooking, cleaning and so on. And now we have all the principals with the exception of Jennie the one-legged housekeeper - Whimsley, Google, Kylie, Edmund (who is in the crowd, near the back, though you might not have noticed him), Mr. Amazon - in one place, and something dramatic is obviously about to happen. But what?\nNow I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go all John Fowles here (see the book in the title) and pontificate about the nature of the plot as artifice and the role of the author. That\u0026rsquo;s so last century. Plus, when Fowles wrote that he could send his heroine this way or that, and when he wrote his alternative endings, he had actually finished his book, so the questioning of his role as author was a little precious.\nMy problem is different. I don\u0026rsquo;t have two ways to finish the story, I have none. In fact, there is no story from here on.\nI have some ideas about things that might happen next, including what seems to me a rather neat twist about the obviously impending assault on Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop, but they are vague and they have problems. Not least among them is my growing tiredness with Whimsley himself. His one-dimensional nature was a benefit in Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook (written just over a year ago! how time flies), but after stretching him over 15,000 words rather than 2,000 I am not sure there is much more to be said about the internet from the point of view of a delusional alcoholic gothic anachronism.\nI did think Kylie may provide an alternative focus for the story, but she has fallen somewhere between a youthful village mob-boss, a smart and witty kid, and a yokel, without one aspect of her character really crystallizing in my imagination.\nAnd then there is the technology issue. Clearly the Kindle has to come in to the plot somehow. Having Google already on scene means that a last-minute twist driven by the Google Book Settlement might be a nice way to finish off the tale. Perhaps Kylie drives Amazon out of town only to hand Google her stories for him to distribute? And I am sure that after all this it will turn out that there are indeed mole-people, but that they are working for Google, not Amazon, slavishly copying all those books for his ever-expanding guidebook.\nSo we will see. I realize this raises questions about the responsibility of the author to finish a story once started. I would like to finish it, and I expect that I will do so. But there will be no episode this week.\nThis is not a fish for attention and reinforcement, by the way. I have appreciated the comments on earlier episodes. And to prove that it is not, I will close comments on this posting. It\u0026rsquo;s just an observation that I have other things going on, like work and family and friends and books and spring, and I have no episodes stocked away ready to be brought out and posted.

In the previous episode, Kylie and Edmund spent a morning running Whimsley\u0026rsquo;s differ and made some disturbing findings about the Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s recommendations. Then Kylie left without warning to go and steal some lunch, leaving Whimsley even more bemused than usual.]\nAfter the excitement and confusion of Kylie and Edmund\u0026rsquo;s investigation, evening found me tired and emotional. My head was spinning with all the numbers they had collected and what Kylie seemed to make of them. You may not believe this, but I was feeling a little out of my depth. At sea even. We gentry typically have little use for numbers bigger than a dozen or so; anything more and we have hired help to deal with them. And though my interest in the differ had got me more familiar with numerology than most of my class, I had always been more enthusiastic about building the device than actually using it.\nI had written Kylie off as riff-raff when I first met her, but I was beginning to realize that some of these youngsters may actually know a thing or two. Her outburst about Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s unfairness carried the mark of immaturity and self-dramatization so characteristic of her class and sex, but as I pored over the notebook I really did not know what to make of the reams of Edmund\u0026rsquo;s writing in my notebook. Yesterday Kylie had showed me one page of summary and claimed that is showed Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s populist claims to be fraudulent, but as I turned page after page of my notebook I could make neither head nor tail of the admirably neat tables and lists that I saw in front of me. My first thought was that it would be embarrassing to have to ask for more detailed explanations, but then I realized that numerology is really a matter for the trades, not for men of standing, so there is no shame in being a little foggy when it comes to details. My neighbour Mr. Belloc was correct when he told me of his friend\u0026rsquo;s fate:\nLord Finchley tried to mend the electric light It struck him dead, and serve him right. It is the duty of the wealthy man To give employment to the artisan.  By then I was looking forward to Kylie\u0026rsquo;s return, when I would demand further explanation of her investigations and take our next steps in what seemed increasingly like a campaign against Mr. Amazon and his book \u0026ldquo;shop\u0026rdquo;. I had the bit between my teeth and was ready to run - I felt energized and zealous.\nBut Kylie did not reappear the next day. I fretted, and paced the grounds.\nAnd she did not appear the following day either. I went by the gardener\u0026rsquo;s hut to ask Edmund her whereabouts, but Edmund had vanished as well! I expressed my concern to his father, who told me Edmund frequently went to stay with relatives in the village and that I \u0026ldquo;should not worry my little head\u0026rdquo;, which seemed charming enough, but was hardly helpful.\nWhen neither was to be seen on the third morning, my spirits tumbled and I retreated into the gloom of Whimsley Hall. Their explosion of youthful energy reminded me what a grim dwelling it has become over the years, and their sudden absence plunged me into weeks of sour temper. The stone pillars, the sepulchural halls, the long shadows - they speak to my bones through the generations of Whimsleys, and yet there are times when I resent their weight and their lugubrious depths. A darkness came over me in those days, despite the summer sunshine outside. I spent morning after morning in the breakfast room just staring at the patterns made by the damp on the ornate wallpaper, afternoons in the library poring slack-jawed over erotic tales and cheap pulp novels. The evenings in fitful, chemically-assisted slumber.\nGoogle would bring me the newspaper each morning and tell me the odd facts he always has at his fingertips that would normally keep me amused, yet they could do nothing to lift my spirits. Jennie would clatter into the room, swinging on her crutch, to bring me my breakfast or to clean away a few of the every-accumulating cobwebs. Usually a friendly sight, she became a Barquentine-like presence, stunted and cantakerous and clouded with a deep rage. And why not? He family has served mine for six generations, tied almost as intimately as myself to the arches and history of Whimsley Hall. She has watched from close up my failure to maintain its legacy, to prevent its fall. The world was changing around me, I felt. Whimsley Hall has been, truth to tell, an anachronism for years. And now, in the new world of the prim Mr. Amazon and his impersonally-friendly recommendations, what place would there be for the traditional virtues of short sharp floggings, of loyalty and doffings of caps and tied cottages? Ritual and symbol were fading. I could see no way to raise myself from despondency.\nIt was Jennie who dragged me out of my self-absorpion, as autumn approached and the winds and rain came back to scour Whimsley village. One morning she hobbled in with my usual breakfast tray of fried eggs, fried bacon, fried black pudding, fried potatoes, fried sausages, fried mushrooms, fried tomatoes and fried bread, together with a half-full bowl of soup. She was breathing deeply, clearly exhausted from her journey up the staircase as she cleared a spot on the desk and threw the tray unceremoniously in front of me. \u0026ldquo;There you go. Full English. Not that it will help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean, help?\u0026rdquo; Jennie rarely spoke these days, so I was taken aback.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve not been eating right for weeks. Ever since that excitement with Kylie and Edmund and the differ. You\u0026rsquo;re going downhill in a big way sir, and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to stand by and watch it happen. You need to pull yourself together.\u0026rdquo;\nOf course, if there is one thing guaranteed not to help a person in spiritual pain it is telling them to pull themselves together. I scowled and stabbed a fork half-hearedly at a half-hearted sausage.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re fretting about them numbers Kylie and Edmund put together ain\u0026rsquo;t you? She\u0026rsquo;s too quick for the likes of you, that one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know Kylie?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026rdquo;, she said in a most un-servant-like tone, \u0026ldquo;they don\u0026rsquo;t call it Whimsley village for nothing. It\u0026rsquo;s not exactly surprising if I live down the street from Kylie Higgins is it? There\u0026rsquo;s not that many streets. And even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t, everyone knows Kylie. You can\u0026rsquo;t miss that one, what with running the bookie\u0026rsquo;s for her Dad. She\u0026rsquo;s smart, that kid, and she puts up with no nonsense.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The bookie\u0026rsquo;s eh? That would explain her facility with numbers. Do you know where she is? She said she would be back, but then she and Edmund just vanished.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well she\u0026rsquo;s been up to no good, I can tell you that. Sometimes I sit on my porch of an evening you know. Watch the dogs fight, just to pass the time. It\u0026rsquo;s not easy to get around a lot, what with having one leg. Not that some people care, getting me to hop up and down staircases all bloody day long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A little exercise will do you good, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. Just you wait and see. But what do you mean \u0026lsquo;up to no good\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What I heard was that she decided Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s a fraud. So she\u0026rsquo;s been rounding up some of the local kids - teenagers with nowt to do over the summer holidays. She started off by telling them stories about this Wazzock character and his dragon and they loved it. But then last night she just stopped. They got mad and she just says \u0026lsquo;Well if you want to know more you\u0026rsquo;d better go and get Mr. Bloody Amazon to sell you a book then.\u0026rsquo; They didn\u0026rsquo;t look so keen on that, so she says \u0026lsquo;And if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to buy one, maybe you could just take it. Who\u0026rsquo;s to stop you?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; So I reckon she\u0026rsquo;s got it in for this Amazon and she\u0026rsquo;s going to set the neighbourhood kids on him - break in and do the place over, if you get my meaning. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve already done it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve no doubt she\u0026rsquo;s capable of vandalism. But vandalism won\u0026rsquo;t help sell her book, will it? I think I\u0026rsquo;ll have to talk some sense into the young harridan. We pillars of the community have a duty, don\u0026rsquo;t you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You betcha. You\u0026rsquo;d better not waste any time if you want to stop her. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably find her at the bookie\u0026rsquo;s or in the park by the pond. So you won\u0026rsquo;t be needing these eggs then? Not to worry, I\u0026rsquo;ll look after them.\u0026rdquo; And with that Jennie whisked the tray from under my nose, and clattered off towards the staircase before I could say anything, spilling the remaining soup in all directions as she went.\nIt was indeed time, I decided, to take action. Raising myself from my torpor I flung open the windows and breathed in the stale odour of the Whimsley air. I found my walking stick, put on my heaviest boots and within a few minutes I was striding off down the road to the village, with the cobwebs of my mind left among the cobwebs of Whimsley Hall. Just as I approached the gate I noticed Google talking to the gardener. He\u0026rsquo;s a big man and might be handy if there\u0026rsquo;s trouble, I decided. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re with me Google!\u0026rdquo; I cried, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s trouble at Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s shop and we need to be the voice of reason. I know you don\u0026rsquo;t like the man - not too keen on him myself - but we can\u0026rsquo;t have hooliganism in Whimsley village. Not cricket is it?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m gratified to say that Google looked shocked. I can tell you that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen often. He dropped his conversation like a hot potato and came after me, and the gardener followed too.\nWe approached the village and turned up the street on which Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s bookshop was found, and were greeted by the sight of a crowd of youth - perhaps twenty of them - approaching the shop from the other end. They looked tense and nervous; sleeves rolled up, ready for business. Kylie was at their head, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t even acknowledge my presence. Instead the crowd went straight to the bookshop and she yanked at the door.\nIt did not open.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, Amazon!\u0026rdquo; she yelled. \u0026ldquo;I want some answers. And I want you to sell some copies of my book. I\u0026rsquo;ve got some customers here, so let us in, right?\u0026rdquo; She hammered on the door again.\nIt looked like there was going to be trouble.

A list of all episodes is here; the previous episode is here. In the previous episode Kylie began to think that Mr. Amazon might be \u0026ldquo;just like the bastard publishers\u0026rdquo;, pushing big sellers at customers rather than promoting books like her own novel The Adventures of Wazzock. Meanwhile, Whimsley was becoming increasingly befuddled by the swirl of activity around him. His befuddlement even interfered with his sleep\u0026hellip;.]\nI had trouble sleeping that night. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just the heat mixing with the cat-urine-induced damp of the carpets to produce the acidic tang that so characterizes Whimsley Hall in the summer; I find that odour reminds me of my own childhood and is surprisingly comforting. No, Kylie\u0026rsquo;s virulence had quite upset me and my usual tonics did not seem to relax me as they usually do. But finally I slept fitfully, only to dream\u0026hellip;\nI looked out of my bedroom window to see a book lying in the middle of the vegetable garden. As I watched, the book opened and a vine grew from its spine, each page becoming a leaf. The vine sprouted pods periodically along its length, and each one erupted to vomit a new book onto the ground. These new books sprouted vines in turn, and the vegetable garden was soon a mass of twisting green creepers, writhing ever closer to the walls of Whimsley Hall. Before I knew what was happening, they were appearing at the window, and each leaf bore the face of Mr. Amazon. \u0026ldquo;If you like vegetables\u0026rdquo;, said one, \u0026ldquo;maybe you would be interested in this,\u0026rdquo; and the leaf rotted on the stalk, emitting a stench of rotten turnip. \u0026ldquo;If you like books\u0026rdquo;, said another \u0026ldquo;maybe you would like a phonograph, or some toys, or some gourmet groceries\u0026rdquo;, and an avalanche of bread, mechanical devices, soup, toy soldiers, and other contrivances flooded the floor of my bedroom. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a new economy of abundance!\u0026rdquo; crowed a face to my left; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a world of choice!\u0026rdquo; cheered one to my right. More and more, faster and faster, the faces wriggled and wormed their way over the windowsill, in through the ceiling, up through the floor, until I could hardly move\nI woke suddenly, tangled in the bedclothes, sweating and shaking. The room was empty, the window closed, the night quiet. I squirmed out from the sheets, ran to the window and stared out, but everything was peaceful. Reassured but exhausted, I put my nightcap back on my head and returned to my bed, and drifted back to slumber. But just as I was about to lose consciousness, I thought I heard Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s voice again. \u0026ldquo;If you want a vision of the future, imagine a human trying on a new boot - forever.\u0026rdquo;\nThe following day dawned grey and wet. The rain battered the windows, and I felt a mixture of relief and disappointment as I realized Kylie was unlikely to venture all the way from the village to Whimsley Hall today, but before I had even started in on my kippers there was a knock at the window.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;re you doing Mr. W? Me and the imbecile had been busy for hours. Come and have a look.\u0026rdquo;\nI ran to the door, and sure enough, steam was billowing from the stable chimney. The differ was running. I stood straight, called for an umbrella, and set out to join the urchins. Jennie the one-legged housekeeper carried the umbrella for me so that I could finish my kippers and tea on the way over. The umbrella kept knocking against my head as she bounced up and down. It really is most inconvenient to keep her on sometimes, but one does what one can.\n\u0026ldquo;So tell me,\u0026rdquo; I demanded as I strode - impressively I\u0026rsquo;m sure - into the stables. \u0026ldquo;What have you been doing with my differ?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; started Kylie, \u0026ldquo;the undersized lamebrain here was watching you when you set up your dials to send the questions to Mr. Amazon. So we worked out how to send our own questions. And we chose another book, and we grew a shop from it. We did the same as you did: choose one book as the seed; visit about a thousand times. Each visit, we look at summat between 0 and 20 books, and the shortarse wrote down all the output.\u0026rdquo; She pointed at Edmund, asleep in the corner. \u0026ldquo;This time we chose something called The Shack by William Paul Young. It\u0026rsquo;s a one of a kind invitation to journey to the very heart of God, and a lot of people seem to like it. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got the whole bookshop down in your notebook. You\u0026rsquo;ll be needing some new cats by the way.\u0026rdquo; She gestured to a damp pile of fur on the floor opposite the dials.\n\u0026ldquo;And what did you find?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In short, a lot. Here, why don\u0026rsquo;t I pour you a drink and you can take a seat while I tell you all about it.\u0026rdquo; She poured what looked like a stiff gin into a cup and handed it over.\nI took the drink with thanks, and sat attentively.\n\u0026ldquo;First things first. In the Shack shop, we spent half the time looking at books in the top 2204 sellers, which is pretty much just the same as the Special Topics in Calamity Physics book shop. And four fifths of the time is spent in the top 22,700, which is five thousand less than yesterday\u0026rsquo;s bookshop, and there\u0026rsquo;s only one in ten views that are outside the top one hundred grand. So that\u0026rsquo;s slanted even more to the best sellers than the Special Topics shop.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve obviously been busy,\u0026rdquo; I was having a hard time following all these numbers, but Kylie ploughed on remorselessly.\n\u0026ldquo;So dummkopf here, he\u0026rsquo;s pumping the bellows like mad and writing it all down and he says \u0026lsquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do some more Kylie!\u0026rsquo;, so we did. He\u0026rsquo;s quite the bundle of energy this kid\u0026rdquo;, She punched him amiably in the stomach and Edmund stirred in his sleep. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll show you the results here.\u0026rdquo;\nA sheet of paper in my notebook had a summary of each of the shops they had created, the median sales rank, and the time spent in browsing around the top 100,000 sellers.

Somehow this venture did not feel entirely mine any more.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like this,\u0026rdquo; the vixen explained, slightly patronizingly I felt, \u0026ldquo;We did a number of books as seeds to see how things went differently depending on your starting point.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But some have the same book name.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because each bookshop may go different ways, depending on what choices the cat tells you to make, and we wanted to see if the results depended a lot on what book you start with. So would you always get the same shop if you start with one book.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And do you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Like, we did Our Mutual Friend twice because we both did Charles Dickens at school and hated it. Can\u0026rsquo;t that man say anything in less than twenty pages? And you can see that one of them ended up with a median of 2471 and one with a median of over 7,000. That\u0026rsquo;s quite a difference on this list. And we did The Long Tail quite a few times because Mr. Amazon told me about that when I asked him how he could help The Adventures of Wazzock to get what it deserves. But in the end, with a few exceptions it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much difference what book you start with. You\u0026rsquo;ll spend at least half your time in the top 10,000 books, which is like browsing around the heavy traffic area of a regular bookshop. And you\u0026rsquo;ll spend almost all your time in the top 100,000, so you don\u0026rsquo;t really see much that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see in a normal bookshop.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about these exceptions you mention?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There are three that are different, and all for the same reason. Look at these bottom three in the list. The Secret History, Last Best Gifts, and The Dilbert Principle.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well The Dilbert Principle is the book that spends most of its time out in the outsider part of the shop, beyond the 100 grand mark. Any idea why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well I have heard that Dilbert is an humorous illustration of some kind. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, so what you get is, you bounce around a lot of other comic books. Every one of the top 14 books is a Dilbert book and from what I can tell all but two of the top 80 are comics. There\u0026rsquo;s not really any one big bestseller in comics, so that\u0026rsquo;s why you spend so much time in the outsider books.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what about Last Best Gifts?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A bit different. It\u0026rsquo;s basically an academic book and you end up going round a lot of other academic books. You don\u0026rsquo;t always do that - like Graph Theory is pretty much like a bestseller - but Last Best Gifts seems to just wander the academic ghetto. What a bunch of losers!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And The Secret History?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now that one is very strange.\u0026rdquo; Kylie frowned and scratched her stomach, contemplating the oddities of the world. \u0026ldquo;This shop has the least number of books of all. Ten thousand different views and there\u0026rsquo;s only 14 different books in the lot! The reason is that early on it gets into books by this bloke Christopher Moore who, it says here, writes offbeat humour. And then all the recommendations are for other Christopher Moore books. And the really odd thing is that none of those books appear in any of the other bookshops. You either like Christopher Moore or you don\u0026rsquo;t I guess.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what have we learned?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, first that it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to get distracted by these little stories of what makes one bookshop different from another.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And second?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait until tomorrow. I\u0026rsquo;m hungry and I\u0026rsquo;m going to steal some lunch.\u0026rdquo; And with that she stalked, hands deep in pockets, down the drive towards the village.\n","date":1236113334,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"7c9a0c46cc6abf4bd95c38b8388422bd","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-recommending-the-big-sellers/","publishdate":"2009-03-03T20:48:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-recommending-the-big-sellers/","section":"post","summary":"[This is the eleventh episode of Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop.

By the end of the summer it will be running on eight campus networks around the country.\nThe idea is to build a new Internet with improved security and the capabilities to support a new generation of not-yet-invented Internet applications, as well as to do some things the current Internet does poorly — such as supporting mobile users.\nThe Stanford Clean Slate project won’t by itself solve all the main security issues of the Internet, but it will equip software and hardware designers with a toolkit to make security features a more integral part of the network and ultimately give law enforcement officials more effective ways of tracking criminals through cyberspace.\nEd Felten of Princeton University responds with an orthodox hacker-purist line:\n[The first misconception] is the notion that today\u0026rsquo;s security problems are caused by weaknesses in the network itself. In fact, the vast majority of our problems occur on, and are caused by weaknesses in, the endpoint devices: computers, mobile phones, and other widgets that connect to the Net. The problem is not that the Net is broken or malfunctioning, it\u0026rsquo;s that the endpoint devices are misbehaving \u0026ndash; so the best solution is to secure the endpoint devices\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an appeal to ye-olde Internet mythologie, complete with deferential references to \u0026ldquo;the founders\u0026rdquo; and their foresight, as if the Internet were some real-world Seldonian Foundation.\nNeither position is good enough, and Jonathan Zittrain\u0026rsquo;s wise book The Future of the Internet And How to Stop It [home page, Open Library entry] does a great job of explaining why and of providing some better ways of thinking about the problem. Yes, designing security into the Internet will inevitably cripple the very flexibility and permissiveness that has made the Internet a continuing source of unpredictable and surprising innovations. But sentimental idealization of the Original Internet and its \u0026ldquo;end-to-end\u0026rdquo; design won\u0026rsquo;t do either [p165].\n[U]sers are not well-positioned to painstakingly maintain their machines against attack, leading them to prefer locked down PCs [as Felten appears to advocate, ed], which carry far worse, if different, problems. Those who favor end-to-end principles \u0026hellip; should realize that intentional inaction at the network level may be self-defeating, because consumers may demand locked-down endpoint environments that promise security and stability with minimum user upkeep. This is a problem for the power user and consumer alike.\n\u0026hellip;When endpoints are locked down, and producers are unable to deliver innovative products directly to users, openness in the middle of the network becomes meaningless. Open highways do not mean freedom when they are so dangerous that one never ventures from the house.\nThe passage shows the strengths and weaknesses of the book. Zittrain takes an unusually and refreshingly pragmatic, realistic view of the Internet, rejecting old approaches as and when needed. On the other hand, you can see from the first two sentences that his prose can be repetitious and dry. You have to work your way through some dense thickets to get to through this forest - but if you are ready to make the effort, it\u0026rsquo;s a worthwhile journey: one of the best Internet books I\u0026rsquo;ve read.\nZittrain\u0026rsquo;s central concern is a dialectical contradiction at the heart the Internet:\n The Internet\u0026rsquo;s success comes from its remarkable ability to repeatedly generate new and unexpected uses.\n This \u0026ldquo;generativity\u0026rdquo; (yuck, what a clumsy word), comes in turn from the deliberate dumbness of the Internet protocols themselves; they were deliberately designed to permit any kind of traffic, for any purpose, to pass between end points of the network.\n But the more the Internet becomes \u0026ldquo;prime time\u0026rdquo;, the more it attracts spammers, virus writers and information thieves to prey on the online population, and the Internet\u0026rsquo;s dumbness is free for them to use as well.\n The more these highway predators threaten our online experience, the more we seek to retreat to the safety of a closed and protected world.\n A closed and protected world may give us safety, but will spell the end of the Internet as a fount of innovation.\n  The Internet, like capitalism, contains the seeds of its own destruction. But Zittrain is a digital reformer, not a revolutionary. Inspired by the continuing success of Wikipedia in the face of similar problems, he favours a combination of light regulation (like health and safety standards for the Net) and popular community action (neighbourhood watch). He believes that these, combined, can preserve the creative spirit that has led to so many innovations, while staving off the worst of the security and other problems. And he makes a solid case, buttressed by broad research (50 pages of notes and references) and a careful, undogmatic and pragmatic attitude.\nThe book is in three parts. Part I is a history of the Internet, told to highlight two design principles that were present right in the original TCP/IP architecture. The first is the \u0026ldquo;procrastination principle\u0026rdquo;, which says the \u0026ldquo;the network itself should not be designed to do anything that can be taken care of by its users\u0026rdquo; [p31]. Most features of a network should be implemented at its computer endpoints (the end-to-end principle) rather than \u0026ldquo;in the middle\u0026rdquo;. The second principle is trust; the Internet is \u0026ldquo;a bucket-brigade partnership in which network neighbors pass along each other\u0026rsquo;s packets\u0026rdquo;, and the assumption of co-operation and fair dealing is present in its design. So the Internet has no built-in security or identification mechanism; anyone can join the network; and there is no quality of service guarantee for packets it delivers. These two principles have led to what Zittrain calls the \u0026ldquo;generative dilemma\u0026rdquo; [36]. \u0026ldquo;The idea of a Net-wide set of ethics has evaporated as the network has become so ubiquitous\u0026rdquo; [45]. So how do we regain security while maintaining the ability to be creative?\nPart II outlines what Zittrain sees as some of the dangers facing the Internet. One danger is the rise of Internet appliances, such as many of today\u0026rsquo;s mobile phones, X-boxes, and Kindles. These devices promise a secure environment, but at the cost of restricting the ability of programmers to be creative. The second is at the other end of the network, where \u0026ldquo;Web 2.0\u0026rdquo; platforms such as Google Maps, Facebook, Salesforce and other hosted environments offer \u0026ldquo;contingent\u0026rdquo; environments for programming, where the prospect of unilateral changes to terms of service or agreements inhibits creativity.\nZittrain is enthusiastic about much of what the Internet has wrought, but he parts company from current digital orthodoxy on these issues. When it comes to Web 2.0, influential commentators from Shirky to Lessig to Tapscott and even to Benkler gloss over the differences between commercial web sites and non-profits, in an attempt to highlight a unified Internet culture. Lessig, for example, talks optimistically of a hybrid economy in which these motivations muddle along next to each other, and while Benkler does see an opposition of interests between the market economy and the collaborative network economy, he never makes much of it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen as clear-minded an analysis of why commercial Web 2.0 platforms threaten creativity as Zittrain provides and I agree with him wholeheartedly.\nThe mobile Internet is only beginning to get the kind of attention that Web 2.0 has received. Today\u0026rsquo;s smartphones and yesterday\u0026rsquo;s desktop computers are similar in terms of computational power (see this claim of Windows 3.1 running on a Nokia N95 if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me). But whereas Microsoft got hauled in front of the courts to keep the desktop computing environment open for non-Microsoft applications and opposing the bundling of Internet Explorer, there are no such worries for mobile phone vendors as they keep their proprietary app stores and their managed devices in the name of security. There are layers of the iPhone, the BlackBerry - yes, and Android devices too - that are open only to the operating system, and which third-party applications cannot access.\nA natural response to Zittrain\u0026rsquo;s worry that we face an Internet of closed appliances (or, as Margo Seltzer calls them, \u0026ldquo;gizmos\u0026rdquo;) and closed services is that these can exist in parallel with open, \u0026ldquo;generative\u0026rdquo; devices and communications. But Zittrain rejects this particular compromise:\neven in a world of locked-down PCs there will remain old-fashioned generative PCs for professional technical audiences to use. But this view is too narrow. We ought to see the possibilities and benefits of PC generativity made available to everyone, including the millions of people who give no thought to future uses when they obtain PCs, and end up delighted at the new uses to which they can put their machines. And without this ready market, those professional developers would have far more obstacles to reaching critical mass with their creations.[165]\nThe end-to-end principle, argues Zittrain, has had its day, as \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;middle\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;endpoint\u0026rsquo; are no longer subtle enough to capture the important emerging features of the Internet/PC landscape\u0026rdquo; [167]. In its stead he advocates a more general principle that seeks explicitly to maintain \u0026ldquo;generativity\u0026rdquo;, so that ISP filtering of viruses may be worth considering, for example.\nZittrain sees an inspiration in Wikipedia, whose shambolic, after-the-fact, bits-and-pieces way of fixing problems has been one of its strengths. Zittrain gives two initiatives he has been involved with, that could drive a similar approach for security while maintaining generativity. One is herdict, a browser plugin that collects the input of people from around the world to assess web site accessibility. Another is stopbadware.org , which helps to maintain a list of web sites that may host viruses and other badware. These initiatives extend the now commonplace collection of user experience by commercial software providers and service providers by making the collected data universally available. The distinction between, on the one hand, Google\u0026rsquo;s use of our searches and Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s collection of Windows crash reports and, on the other hand, herdict\u0026rsquo;s goal of making the collected data public is a big one. It shines a light both on the closed nature of the major corporate collectors (no matter how unevil they may claim to be) and on the possibilities of open data. Public access to current databases of virus reports, spam outbreaks, and so on provides a basis for innovative solutions to the worst damages inflicted by malware.\nMaintaining a healthy digital environment - both security and generative - is a commons problem, and while dictatorship is an appealing route to take to solve the security half of the issue, real transparency provides a second possibility that has more chance of solving both. But it needs to be real transparency, not just the half-hearted efforts of Web 2.0 companies as they dance along the line between community and profit.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot more in the book. On the technological front Zittrain sees virtualization technologies as reason for optimism and I agree; I\u0026rsquo;m getting a new computer at work next week and I anticipate running everything in virtual machines. If I get a virus or my registry gets screwed up, I\u0026rsquo;ll roll back to yesterday\u0026rsquo;s state and it will be gone. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the plan. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it works. On the social and political side, the book\u0026rsquo;s final pages tend to wander aroun d issues of privacy, reputation, and behavioural norms without saying a whole lot that\u0026rsquo;s new. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame the book finishes on this topic, because it fizzles out a bit. But don\u0026rsquo;t let that deter you - there is a lot of subtle insight and a real breadth of knowledge in these pages that you rarely see in books about the cutting edge of technology, and Zittrain\u0026rsquo;s efforts deserve to generate a big discussion.\n","date":1235853643,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"8084b50578816b7c5dcdcb41172b6fb1","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/review-the-future-of-the-internet-and-how-to-stop-it-by-jonathan-zittrain/","publishdate":"2009-02-28T20:40:43Z","relpermalink":"/post/review-the-future-of-the-internet-and-how-to-stop-it-by-jonathan-zittrain/","section":"post","summary":"The New York Times recently asked: Do We Need a New Internet?:\nAt Stanford, where the software protocols for original Internet were designed, researchers are creating a system to make it possible to slide a more advanced network quietly underneath today’s Internet.

Certainly no one is leveraging their unilateral control over your bell to hamper user choice, competition, and innovation.\u0026rdquo;\nI often regret asking too many questions of Google. I never know when he is being funny and when he\u0026rsquo;s not. Usually I decide to treat his remarks as humour because life is just easier that way, but he has an excellent poker face so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, never mind. Listen, we have some questions for you. It\u0026rsquo;s about Mr. Amazon.\u0026rdquo;\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s face showed an instant distaste: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do what I can.\u0026rdquo;\nI was just searching for the best way to phrase my questions when Kylie piped up.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey Mr. G. We\u0026rsquo;re trying to find out whether Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s recommendations are going to help me to sell lots of copies of The Adventures of Wazzock. We need to know some things about Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s sales. Like how much he sells that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t get in a regular establishment bookshop.\u0026rdquo; She spat at Edmund as she said this last sentence.\n\u0026ldquo;A fine question young miss. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. I am ashamed to say I know very little about Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s sales in any detail. I have means to find out many things, but he seems capable of great secrecy. But from what I hear it is possible that he makes about 25% of his sales from books beyond the 100,000 mark. Such measurement depends greatly, of course, on what length of time the sales ranks are averaged over. A book that is positioned at 150,000 could easily put itself into the top 100,000 by a single sale - so do you count the sale as before or after the purchase? Still, I imagine the figure is not too far from the truth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When it comes to real bookshops, a small independent bookshop may stock 30,000 titles. But of course they sell special orders too. Perhaps ten percent of their sales are special orders. A large chain store like Heather\u0026rsquo;s Big House O\u0026rsquo;Books may stock 100,000 titles. But there are larger ones still. I am told that Blackwells in Oxford, for example, stocks above 200,000 distinct titles in its shops on The Broad.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a gem Mr. G. That\u0026rsquo;s what we need to know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is?\u0026rdquo; I asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Obviously\u0026rdquo;, said Kylie. \u0026ldquo;Think a bit. He makes one sale in every four from outside the top 100 grand books. But when he mutters his \u0026lsquo;would you be interested\u0026rsquo; guff, we look at these outsider books only about once in eight times. So he\u0026rsquo;s pushing the top sellers, innit? He\u0026rsquo;s only selling them others because he\u0026rsquo;s a convenient way to order books you already know about, which is probably just taking business from the regular bookshops where you might have ordered them before. And quit the boozing, we\u0026rsquo;ve got work to do.\u0026rdquo;\nIt took a moment before I realized she was talking to me. I sheepishly replaced the cap on the flask of cognac and returned it to my overcoat pocket.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey shortbus,\u0026rdquo; Kylie was approaching Edmund, who flinched. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at that other graph of yours. What\u0026rsquo;s it show?\nLater on that day I managed to get a look at the graph, which I reproduce below. Meanwhile, Kylie was telling us all about it.\n\u0026ldquo;So if I read this right, you\u0026rsquo;ve got your views of a book up the side, and your sales rank along the bottom. And most of the books Mr. Amazon shows us are bunched up at the left among the mainstream establishment junk, which we knew already. But it also shows that the ones he shows many times lot are almost all best sellers. Look at them buggers that have come up more than 50 times! Let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026rdquo; (she scoured the notebook again, brow furiously furrowed.) \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s 31 books that we looked at over 50 times. Twenty three of those 31 are in the top grand. All but two of them is in the top two grand. And I bet not one of them is The Adventures of Wazzock. He\u0026rsquo;s just showing everyone the establishment books innit? I thought he was all friendly to us kids, but it looks like he\u0026rsquo;s just like the bastard publishers! I should have known. He\u0026rsquo;s all about the money. What an absolute pillock.\u0026rdquo; She spat on the ground as she said this.\nSuch was her virulence I confess that I actually felt sorry for Mr. Amazon, who is after all just trying to make a living.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s not leap to conclusions young Kylie. After all, this is just one sample, like you said. Maybe if we set up the differ again and start with another one, we\u0026rsquo;ll see something different. And would you like an ice cream?\u0026rdquo;\nHer expression remained ominously grim.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not being bought off with no ice cream. But you\u0026rsquo;re right Mr. W. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to try again. I\u0026rsquo;ll be back tomorrow morning.

He may smudge it with his grubby gardener fingers, or drip his slimy gardener snot over my pages!

You know, like Kylie says.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know that scold Kylie? How on earth?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes sir. At least, when we\u0026rsquo;re at school she always beats me up and takes my lunch money from me, and even though it\u0026rsquo;s summer holidays she turned up at my house yesterday because she said she was bored and wanted a reason to be pissed off at someone. I was looking at your notebook so she just took it. She\u0026rsquo;s a bit like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I had noticed. But wait a minute! You had my notebook? What kind of effrontery is that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, judging from how loud you were snoring and the level of the scotch bottle on the table in the conservatory you weren\u0026rsquo;t going to be needing it, so I thought I might be able to help you a little.\u0026rdquo;\nI brandished the switch, but restrained myself.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me the rest, vagabond.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well Kylie, she looks at it, and she says \u0026lsquo;This is T\u0026rsquo;owd Git\u0026rsquo;s innit?\u0026lsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;T\u0026rsquo;owd Git?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what we all call you in the village. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what it means. Something like \u0026ldquo;his lordship\u0026rdquo; but more affectionate I think. Anyway, she stared at it for some time and muttered to herself and then looked at me and said in this really grim voice, \u0026lsquo;The median salesrank is crap. And the distribution is scanty. There are too many repeats here. Something\u0026rsquo;s not right.\u0026rsquo; Then she gave it back to me and slapped my on the head.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Median distribution? What could she mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know sir, but I think she\u0026rsquo;s coming up here soon to talk to you about it. She\u0026rsquo;s not right pleased.\u0026rdquo;\nSure enough, who was coming up the driveway but Kylie, striding purposefully, arms swinging and fingers clenching. She entered the stable and stood, arms crossed, staring pugnaciously up at me.\n\u0026ldquo;Well Mr. W. Looks like we have a problem don\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that, Kylie? This is really too early in the morning for stressful conversations. Can\u0026rsquo;t it wait?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Either you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with that differ of yours\u0026rdquo; - she gestured dismissively towards my magnificent machine - or Mr. Amazon ain\u0026rsquo;t what I hoped he\u0026rsquo;d be. Now between you and me, guv\u0026rsquo;nor, Mr. Amazon looks a lot more likely to be the goods than you do. But I\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot riding on The Adventures of Wazzock and I need to know for sure. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know what you mean? Amazon is a prim little functionary, while I am a scholar and a gentleman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right you are. So he\u0026rsquo;s got an eye on the ready and you\u0026rsquo;re just pissing about, when you\u0026rsquo;re not blotto that is.\u0026rdquo; She nodded at my overcoat pocket, where my cognac flask created, I fear, a slight bulge.\n\u0026ldquo;And one other thing. That notebook of yours said it was volume 49 number 11, so I\u0026rsquo;m thinking you do a lot of writing. I bet you\u0026rsquo;re going to write this whole escapade down in one of them notebooks of yours ain\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, the thought had crossed my mind,\u0026rdquo; I admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;Well I bet you make a reet mess of the way I speak. I bet it\u0026rsquo;s nowt like how I sound. I bet you can\u0026rsquo;t even decide what part of the country I come from.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Never mind that, young lady. Back to your visit. I have a proposal.\u0026rdquo;\nShe raised her left eyebrow quizzically.\n\u0026ldquo;Three things. First, you get to take part in my grand inquisition here. I\u0026rsquo;d be lying if I told you that I like Mr. Amazon, but I do want to be fair and you may be able to help balance my enthusiasms.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fair enough.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Second, you stop taking young Edmund\u0026rsquo;s lunch money.\u0026rdquo; The gormless youngster was positively cowering from Kylie, and a small part of me felt almost protective of the rabbit-like idiot.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem. He never has much anyway.\u0026rdquo; She glanced scornfully and dismissively in the oaf\u0026rsquo;s direction. \u0026ldquo;Relax, prat. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you be.\u0026rdquo; Edmund gave a long and relieved sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;And third, you promise to work with us as a team.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No sweat guv\u0026rsquo;nor. Let\u0026rsquo;s get to work. Show me what you\u0026rsquo;ve got.\u0026rdquo;\nI brought out my notebook and Edmund\u0026rsquo;s scrapbook. She snatched them both and took them into the corner and stared fixedly at them for ten minutes. I was a little affronted, but Kylie was such a hellion that I dared not interrupt, so I pretended to be inspecting and oiling the differ. Finally, she emerged.\n\u0026ldquo;Right Mr. W. First thing. Your method is crap. You obviously have no idea about proper statistics. You look like you\u0026rsquo;re making it up as you go along.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But the differ\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But let\u0026rsquo;s put that aside. I don\u0026rsquo;t see that other methods are going to give information that\u0026rsquo;s much different. The best way to know what Mr. A. is up to is to look inside his operation, but even I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do that, so I\u0026rsquo;m sure you haven\u0026rsquo;t got a clue. Without that kind of insider info, this will have to do. The problem is not collecting information, it\u0026rsquo;s knowing what questions you want to ask of it once you\u0026rsquo;ve collected it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well why don\u0026rsquo;t you tell me your ideas, since you seem to have such a low opinion of mine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right you are then. You\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple of good things, here in this scrapbook. Funny how your handwriting is getting better, and these graphs are very nice. Is this your neat copy or what?\u0026rdquo; Fortunately she did not give me a chance to answer.\n\u0026ldquo;This graph. Here\u0026rsquo;s the way I see it. You\u0026rsquo;ve got about 10,000 book views here. That\u0026rsquo;s books Mr. A. has recommended and that you\u0026rsquo;ve picked up to look at. The median sales rank is 2120. That means about half of all the book views in this shop, the one that\u0026rsquo;s grown from Special Topics in Crap Physics or whatever, is spent in the top 2000 sellers. Now 2000 is a small number.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No it ain\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; the stunted moron interjected, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a bloody big number.\u0026rdquo;\nKylie paused. \u0026ldquo;Unbelievably, you may be right, blockhead. First thing we do, we find out how big a number 2000 is. And there are some other numbers too. Four fifths of the time is spent looking at books in the top 30,000. And just over an eighth of the time is spent looking at books outside the top 100,000. So are these big numbers or what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I believe I can help.\u0026rdquo; I had been caught a little off-balance with this flurry of numbers and thoughts, but righted myself quickly to reassert my natural authority. \u0026ldquo;I have just the person who can tell us these things. My butler is a whiz when it comes to trivia.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that Mr. Google?\u0026rdquo; asked Kylie, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, he\u0026rsquo;s smart.

The least I can do is defend him against his critics, so here are answers to a few of the most common criticisms in the comments to his post.\nI can switch any time I like, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem. Or \u0026ldquo;The Google monopoly seems a lot less scary than it\u0026rsquo;s marketshare would suggest because a new search engine is only a click away.\u0026rdquo;\nNo you can\u0026rsquo;t switch any time you like, for two reasons.\nFirst: you can use another search engine, but when everyone else is using Google to find their way around the web, any other search engine that uses popularity as an input (most of them I think) is going to reflect Google\u0026rsquo;s recommendations. Google shapes the web as much as mapping it, and you can\u0026rsquo;t escape that shape easily even if you use another search engine.\nSecond: Google isn\u0026rsquo;t in the search business, it is in the advertising business. And while Adwords is its big moneyspinner, Doubleclick and Adsense ads are all over the place and you can\u0026rsquo;t escape them (not easily anyway).\n_The problem is that Microsoft acted in a belligerent and bullying manner, whereas google has not. An no one feels locked in, because they can switch in an instant.\n_Can we get past this idea that Microsoft is full of moustache twirling evildoers while Google is populated by friendly helpful people? Face it: companies respond to incentives. Google\u0026rsquo;s incredible success has saved it the tough decisions of squeezing the most out of every customer (and employee) so far, but when times get tough for Google, as they will sometime, it will squeeze just as hard as Microsoft, because it will have no choice.\nAlso, we have a different relationship to Google than to Microsoft. Most of us are Microsoft customers, but we are not Google\u0026rsquo;s customers, we are Google\u0026rsquo;s product. It sells us to advertisers. Google\u0026rsquo;s treatment of its advertisers is mysterious, but there are grumbles. For example, see El Reg on Google\u0026rsquo;s Money Machine; its ability to place ads on search terms that an advertiser did not bid on (and so collect money) and to extend ads to the iPhone (and charge for them) without asking their customers. And Google is quite keen to \u0026ldquo;embrace and extend\u0026rdquo; news organizations with Google News, and to use its site-directed top search results to take extra advertising revenue from the sites it directs you to.\nGive Google time, then ask their customers if they feel they can switch.\nA lot of people compared the Googopoly to the Micropoly. My very smart colleague Graeme commented: \u0026ldquo;In short, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s monopoly was created, Google\u0026rsquo;s was earned.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a tough one, but I disagree. In the key areas, both MS and Google made very good products by making the most of increasing returns to scale and from network effects. Many years ago I used Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, but Office just got better and more integrated. But that\u0026rsquo;s a subjective opinion and it is asking for trouble. In the end, sure we use Word because everyone else uses Word, but in a way we use Google because everyone else uses Google: like Microsoft they work hard to exploit their relationship to us. Microsoft did it with design consistency and with file format compatibility, Google uses the information we give them every time we search to tweak its products._ _Both have produced some very good products and some products that win just because of company size. I use Google Docs because the scale of Google\u0026rsquo;s operation makes it responsive and convenient, but let\u0026rsquo;s face it, it\u0026rsquo;s an unpleasant experience compared to other writing and spreadsheet products.\nAnd finally, although I can\u0026rsquo;t find a comment, there\u0026rsquo;s this impression that Google is closed  open while Microsoft is openclosed. Rubbish! Google gives away stuff that doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to it. When it comes to its core technologies - the Adwords and Search algorithms and its data centre construction, Google is as closed and secretive as anyone. It recently refused to give information on water use at one of the new data centres because \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re in a highly competitive industry and, frankly, one or two little pieces of information like that in the hands of our competitors can do us considerable damage. So we can\u0026rsquo;t discuss it.\u0026rdquo;\nVery friendly.\n","date":1234298637,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"179a3f7bc6b306615353c56b03b94115","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/google-monocult/","publishdate":"2009-02-10T20:43:57Z","relpermalink":"/post/google-monocult/","section":"post","summary":"Jeff Atwood at Coding Horror sent about 3,000 people here over the last couple of days from his post about the dangers of Google Monoculture.

Just watch and learn. And pump those bellows, there\u0026rsquo;s a good lad.\u0026rdquo;\nThe halfwit pumped and soon I was ready to embark on my first serious venture.\nI had the first few lists of books for what I now thought of as a bookshop grown from a single seed, that seed being Special Topics in Calamity Physics. I had already carried out two \u0026ldquo;visits\u0026rdquo; to the shop, first picking up a dozen books in succession, and using Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s recommendations to build shelves around each book, selecting one from the shelf each time as a starting point for a new shelf. Now I wanted to do this again and again, and I wanted to find out just how big the bookshop would grow, and how diverse it would be. This time I would use Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s sales rank to tell me about what kind of books Mr. Amazon is really recommending. Would Mr. Amazon lead me into the world of undiscovered books? Would he, I found myself wondering, recommend Kylie\u0026rsquo;s The Adventures of Wazzock? Would \u0026ldquo;browsing\u0026rdquo; through his recommendations uncover the hidden gems in the mass of barely-read, midlist and overlooked books? I could hardly wait to find out.\n\u0026ldquo;Right young Edmund, let\u0026rsquo;s get ready for some serious work. You pump the bellows like mad, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give this engine a run like she\u0026rsquo;s never had before!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whoopee!!\u0026rdquo; yelled the knee-high dullard, and he pumped harder and harder. I flung the cat at the wall and it selected a visit-length of 5 books. I sent off the first request and it came back quick as a flash, I flung the cat, and repeated four more times. I scribbled the list in my notebook, this time together with the sales rank of each book:\nBridge of Sighs (1,132)\nThe Gathering (978)\nOn Chesil Beach (3451)\nOut Stealing Horses (268)\nMan Gone Down (62472)\nI was exhausted, but a convenient thought came to my mind. Edmund had got the bellows working well enough that he only pumped them one minute in every three.\n\u0026ldquo;Edmund! Can you write, young lad?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That I can Mr. Whimsley sire. I win prizes for my calligraphy.\u0026rdquo;\nI doubted the word of the stunted cretin, but thought he may be able to help me nevertheless. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a chance then. Come here and write what I say.\u0026rdquo; I handed him my pencil and notebook, and constructed the next visit:\nTree of Smoke (3583)\nThe Savage Detectives (1130)\nThe Gathering (978)\nBridge of Sighs (1132)\nThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle (17)\nI had to admit his handwriting was exemplary, and quick as a flash too. Perhaps young Edmund was not as retarded as I had thought, despite his perpetually snot-dripping nose. We sent a query again and constructed another visit, then another and another. By the end of the morning my notebook was full with no less than a thousand visits. I was exhausted and young Edmund was sweating profusely.\nI looked at Edmund\u0026rsquo;s nebbish expression and, not for the first time, told myself I was really too kind hearted. Here was this child, destined by bloodline to be nothing but a mere gardener, and here was I giving him this once in a lifetime opportunity to take part in a numerological experiment of the highest order. \u0026ldquo;Whimsley, you sentimentalist\u0026rdquo;, I told myself, \u0026ldquo;if you deprive the child of a severe and structured environment you\u0026rsquo;re doing him no favours.\u0026rdquo; Yet my soft heart won over. \u0026ldquo;Take a break, Edmund\u0026rdquo;, I told him, \u0026ldquo;and as special reward, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to weed the vegetable patch this afternoon, just the flower beds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh thank you sir.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just be ready tomorrow morning. We start bright and early at ten.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m such a soft touch.

A list of all instalments is here; the previous instalment is here.]\nEdmund, the gardener\u0026rsquo;s son, has the look of a runt about him: he is undersized, has a perpetually dripping nose and a habit of scratching his backside. He is looked down on by the Whimsley village children, which is an achievement in itself: he positively broadcasts stupidity. On the other hand, his is obedient and hardworking, which are important qualities in the servant classes, and has a strong pair of arms so I decided to let him assist me with my investigation.\nI dragged Edmund out to the stables on a warm July morning, ready to set the differ to work and send more questions to Mr. Amazon, and with a fresh supply of pencils to record the results in my trusty notebook. I set the young halfwit to start the bellows and he soon worked up a healthy pressure. I turned the dials and tugged the pulleys to set my question, and was about to pull the master lever one more time, when Edmund shouted and pointed up at the stable roof. I followed the line of the simpleton\u0026rsquo;s finger, and saw the topmost reaches of my differ perspiring and shivering, as if with fever. The pistons wailed, the cylinders grated, and then the edifice ground to a juddering halt with an earsplitting thud. The differ was obviously damaged and my investigations were going nowhere soon. I kicked Edmund out of the stables in frustration.\nFor the next month I searched for parts, scoured manuals, and consulted other differ enthusiasts in an attempt to fix my machine. And while I waited for the postman to bring the replies to my questions I did what I could to keep myself occupied. I even cleaned some of the abandoned rooms in Whimsley Hall, myself. The drawing room I restored to, if not exactly its former stateliness, then at least habitability. The worst of the cobwebs and nests were evicted, and with a solution of vinegar and water I attacked the windows so vigorously that light penetrated the room for the first time in years. Thanks to the previous gloom the velvet drapery and the rich colours of the upholstery were unfaded, but the profuse spattering of stains were too ingrained to be removed. I did not mind. They were part, you might say, of the fabric of the place, and each with its own memory.\nWhen I was too tired to work on Whimsley Hall I walked to the village and back, pacing the bounds of the old estate. With head thrust forward, deep in thought, and with a perpetual frown on my face I was doubtless a forbidding site sight, and I was avoided by most villagers.\nIt was on one of these walks that I was bumped into, literally, by one of the youngsters I had seen around the village - none other than the pugilistic Jane Austen you may recall from a couple of months earlier. I was walking alongside the river, and seized her by the ear as she attempted to barge past on the narrow pathway.\n\u0026ldquo;Ow! Leggo! Piss off guv\u0026rsquo;nor!\u0026rdquo; she bawled, in that endearing manner I have come to know so well in the past few months.\n\u0026ldquo;Not before you tell me your name, young harridan!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Kylie, innit\u0026rdquo; she grunted.\n\u0026ldquo;How likely. I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced at all. You know who I am?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re the bloke what lives at the Hall, innit?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seventh Earl of Whimsley, but I will let is pass. You can call me Mr. Whimsley and I\u0026rsquo;ll call you Kylie for now. Now listen, I have some questions for you. I need answers and I\u0026rsquo;m prepared to pay. Shall we say a hot chocolate at Mr. Horton\u0026rsquo;s? That should pay for fifteen minutes of your time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever. Just let go of me bloody ear! And stop writin\u0026rsquo; me dialogue in that patronizing phonetic bullshit way. It\u0026rsquo;s not like you speak the way it\u0026rsquo;s written.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Deal. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u0026rdquo;\nI put her down, and we made our way to Mr. Horton\u0026rsquo;s Coffee Establishment where, once I convinced the proprietor Kylie was not about to steal the contents of the till, we sat and drank a mug of hot chocolate. Kylie was a small and wiry child of about fifteen, with a perpetually sullen expression. I told her that I had overheard her yelling about Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop and about her literary ambitions and asked to hear more.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, Mr. Whimsley, I like to write. Always have done, ever since looking after my brothers and sisters when they was real young. I made up stories to keep them from ripping the doors off their hinges. Anything to keep the little buggers quiet. So it became a habit, and I reckon I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at it. But there\u0026rsquo;s no way any of those hi-faluting publishers are going to pay attention to me. I have no education worth speaking of, no contacts to call on\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And almost certainly no talent. But point taken, go on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s like, Mr. Amazon is an odd fish, but I can get the books I like at his shop so I go there sometimes and then one day he told me that if I had written anything I could just give it to him and he\u0026rsquo;d sell it, just like he sells the other books. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that amazing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It certainly sounds attractive. And have you taken him up on his generous offer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You bet! I mean, at first I was pretty suspicious and figured he just wanted to rob me of my just rewards, but I had a word with Mr. Anderson - he\u0026rsquo;s a bloke that lives down our street - and he told me it\u0026rsquo;s OK. He said Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s way better than those other bookshops for me because they\u0026rsquo;re all elitist institutions and Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s on my side. He said something else really weird too\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (here she looked around and lowered her voice) \u0026ldquo;He told me that Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s got a long tail. And that made me think I\u0026rsquo;ve only ever seen him from the front, and I can\u0026rsquo;t look over the desk. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s true! What do you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh I doubt that\u0026rdquo;, was my first reaction, \u0026ldquo;but come to think of it I, too, see him only from the front. And he does have a certain reptilian quality.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Anyway\u0026rdquo;, Kylie carried on, \u0026ldquo;I finished my book a few weeks ago. It\u0026rsquo;s called The Adventures of Wazzock. It\u0026rsquo;s about a boy who finds a polished blue stone in a mountain chain near his home. He discovers that his stone is really a dragon egg when it hatches suddenly in the night. Wazzock gives his dragon the name Saphira, which he learns from the village storyteller. After the dragon hatches the King sends his servants after Wazzock and Saphira, in an effort to capture or kill them. Wazzock and Saphira flee their hometown and embark on a number of adventures involving swordplay, magic, friendship, betrayal, and death.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure they do. Very good, very good. And how is it going?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great. It\u0026rsquo;s only been a few weeks, but I\u0026rsquo;ve already sold five copies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really! And who to?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s my brother and my mum, and then my friend Sharon, and then two boys in my class. Of course, I told them I\u0026rsquo;d beat them up if they didn\u0026rsquo;t buy it. That\u0026rsquo;s called marketing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And is he selling your book at any of his other shops, or just here in Whimsley?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s selling it\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, here her voice dropped to a hushed whisper, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;all over the world. Anywhere you go, you could walk into a Mr. Amazon and ask for The Adventures of Wazzock and he\u0026rsquo;ll sell it to you. Right then and there. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that amaaziing??!! It\u0026rsquo;s just me and my audience. No gatekeepers! It\u0026rsquo;s just like Mr. Anderson said. I\u0026rsquo;m alread y working on my next book, so I\u0026rsquo;m ready once Wazzock goes viral.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Admirable. Admirable. Now that\u0026rsquo;s enough young Kylie. I may have need of you again. I have obviously underestimated both you and Mr. Amazon. You have given me much to think on. Off you go.\u0026rdquo;\nShe grabbed my half-eaten doughnut and waltzed out of the door, looking far too pleased with herself. I pondered, is this how it works? Is this the new world? Are \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; bookshops a thing of the past? Perhaps - the idea filled me with dread - despite all my effort at staying up to date, I am not quite as au courant as I like to think. Maybe - notwithstanding my natural flair for the common touch - I am a touch elitist at heart? And could it be that - however maverick I may be in my soul - there is a waft of conservatism that has settled over me in my middle age?\nMy personal doubts about Mr. Amazon carried over into these broader concerns that I, as a member of the gentry, have such a duty to worry over. Does Mr. Amazon really give any book a chance at success, as young Kylie claims? Is he really an agent in the quest for a more democratic, more varied and diverse culture? Or is he, perhaps, a gatekeeper just as effective as those publishing houses the local hooligans scorn? And is he hiding a long tail behind that desk of his?\nDisturbing thoughts. I obviously needed to find out more. My investigation of Amazon seemed to be growing more urgent at every turn, but until the replacement parts for my differ arrived I was stalled. My impatience was, I am sure, almost as intense as yours, waiting for the next episode of my story\u0026hellip;\n","date":1233605661,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"e0accfd239c427c223ace07fae272543","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-down-with-gatekeepers/","publishdate":"2009-02-02T20:14:21Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-down-with-gatekeepers/","section":"post","summary":"[This is the seventh instalment of Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop.

Then relax and, if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind a few f-words, enjoy the hilarity of a supposed media company shooting itself in the foot. Then the other foot. Then going so far beyond shooting itself in the foot you won\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\nBut, while that\u0026rsquo;s one way to look at it, there is also the possibility that this is a tragedy. That the state of the world is so grim that these poor hapless people are driven to extremes of apparent stupidity. What could be going on in their lives to reduce them to this? Do they have landlords demanding the rent by tomorrow or they will be out on the street? Or what? Because, really, there is something here that is undeniably pathetic.\nBut enough of the teaser. On to the action. A couple of weeks ago I posted about my own unpleasant experience with SYS-CON media. I already knew about, but did not mention, the LinuxWorld fiasco there, because it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem fair. But that\u0026rsquo;s for later.\nYesterday a comment on that post led me to Jame-Ane Ervin\u0026rsquo;s blog, where she describes a run-in with the CEO of SYS-CON. In short, as an advertiser on SYS-CON she offered some suggestions, in an abrupt but not impolite way, on how they could improve what they do. And she asked to be removed from their site. According to Jame Ervin (whom I have never met) she got a reply including these words from SYS-CON CEO Fuat Kircaali:\nWho the fuck you think you are, lady? Are you fucking out of your mind?\nYou are certainly mixing SYS-CON media with some other company. The reason you heard from the CEO of the “most powerful” tech media company in North America today is because he could not believe your email, out of more than 4,000 contacts who received the same email, you had to be the only bitch with a big fucking mouth.\nNow it did occur to me that this was so unbelievable, so incomprehensibly over the top, that it was a fake. I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t know Jame Ervin. It could be a hoax, right? She could have said something unbelievably offensive to Mr. Kircaali to prompt this outburst? The world is a pretty damn strange place sometimes, right?\nBut today I see that SYS-CON have actually posted, on their own site, the entire correspondence, to explain their response. So go read it if you are interested. Did Jame Ervin behave outrageously? She did not. The entire correspondence just makes the Kircaali email more jaw-droppingly offensive than it already seemed.\nAnd just in case you thought this was all, SYS-CON also posted an article about the affair. Go ahead, read it. I\u0026rsquo;ll wait here.\nDone? Good. I think my favourite line is this:\nWell, reporters use the word \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; casually these days. Last week, there was a headline published here, announcing the new Yahoo CEO as \u0026ldquo;Tough Brazen Bitch Takes Over Yahoo,\u0026rdquo; but I know Carol Bartz and this crackpot marketing woman is no Carol Bartz.\nThe linked-to headline is, of course, a SYS-CON one.\nNow maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be joking about something as offensive and aggressive as these insults. But really, the SYS-CON people can surely not be in a position to hurt Ms. Ervin professionally, and I trust they live miles away, so I\u0026rsquo;m assuming the offense - unpleasant as it is - carries no real threat with it. In which case it comes across as being simply delusional.\nAnd now back to the beginning, where I mentioned LinuxWorld. A technical magazine run by volunteer editors, the entire editorial board resigned a couple of years ago in response to a complete lack of editorial control and in the wake of a scandal involving personal attacks written by a SYS-CON writer. When Dana Blankenhorn wrote about this SYS-CON responded by, you guessed it, publicly having a go at Blankenhorn. Of course, being SYS-CON, their article is posted across all their publications, including the unbelievable Yacht and Charters Magazine: see here, calling him a \u0026ldquo;crackpot\u0026rdquo; (the same word they used for Ms. Ervin) and poking fun at Mr Blankenhorn\u0026rsquo;s possible joblessness.\nFrom what it looks like, he has been in the business for 25 years and can not find a job, and because of that he hates the company (SYS-CON) and its founder.\nIs this over now? Part of me hopes so. But I admit that another part of me can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what these people say next. You really couldn\u0026rsquo;t make this stuff up, could you?\n","date":1233258580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4487984938dc126cc4a4440ec5fa9e3b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/syscon-media-redux-you-couldnt-make-this-stuff-up/","publishdate":"2009-01-29T19:49:40Z","relpermalink":"/post/syscon-media-redux-you-couldnt-make-this-stuff-up/","section":"post","summary":"Here is how I was going to start this post:\nDo you have fifteen minutes or so?

A list of all instalments is here; the previous instalment is here.]\nI rocketed over to my stables at the crack of noon and cleaned up the old difference engine, or differ as we enthusiasts call it. My friend Mr. Babbage, you will recall, had told me that Mr. Amazon had a new trick - instead of going to Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop, one could use a difference engine to ask him as many questions as you like. I determined to use my differ to interrogate Amazon and better understand how his intriguing operation works.\nI had to chase out a few voles and a cat that had set up house in among the levers and pistons, and it was nearly dinner time before I fired up the bellows and the great machine began to hum. It had been some while since I last set it going and the smell of burning dust was atrocious. But finally I was able to start communing with it, and I readied my questions.\nMy first query to Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s service was a simple one, and harked back to my earliest visit. \u0026ldquo;If I tell you I like Special Topics in Calamity Physics, what books would you recommend?\u0026rdquo;\nI twisted and turned the knobs until the instructions were in place, and then pulled on the master lever to set the machine to work. Steam hissed, a piercing high-pitched whine drilled at my ear drums, and for a moment I thought the whole thing was going to explode. What could be going on? I was sure I had the instructions right. I pulled harder on the lever, hoping to blow past the obstruction, but to no use. The temperature reading was creeping dangerously high and I cast about for what was wrong. Finally I caught sight of a large beetle stuck in one of the outlet valves, obstructing the flow of air. I pulled at the release lever, shutting down the process, and watched in relief as the temperature lowered.\nOnce I had cleaned out the valves, I took a swig from the sherry bottle and pulled the master lever again. \u0026ldquo;If I tell you I like Special Topics in Calamity Physics, what books would you recommend?\u0026rdquo; And this time, after a few scraping noises, the output pointers began to swing. A short while deciphering and I had my answer:\nAbsurdistan by Gary Shteyngart\nSuite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky\nThe Yiddish Policeman\u0026rsquo;s Union by Michael Chabon\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz\n\u0026hellip; and a handful of others.\nI was thrilled. I stared at the list, entranced, until a thought crawled into my awareness. Here, it said, was the link between Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop and what I think of as a real bookshop.\nMr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s is not a bookshop. It is closer to the truth to say it is a mechanism, a differ if you like, that we each use to generate our own personal bookshop, with shelves and all, by the questions we ask of its proprietor. I had accused Mr. Amazon of not having shelves, but here was a set of books grouped together as I looked at Special Topics\u0026hellip; Surely that is close enough to a shelf.\nI chose one of the ten recommendations at random by the usual method of throwing a barnyard cat at the wall and counting the number of squeals it emitted. The cat squealed twice to indicate The Yiddish Policeman\u0026rsquo;s Union (occasionally the cat does not scream, so the counting starts at zero). and I sent up my second question to Mr. Amazon. \u0026ldquo;If I tell you I like The Yiddish Policeman\u0026rsquo;s Union, what books would you recommend?\u0026rdquo; A moment later, back came the answer:\nThe Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay (also by Michael Ch abon)\nGentlemen of the Road by, you guessed it, Michael Chabon.\nOn Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz\n\u0026hellip; and a handful of others.\nThe shelf is longer, I muttered. Quickly I flung the cat again to select a book from the list (Falling Man, by Don DeLillo) and sent off the next query.\nThe Yiddish Policeman\u0026rsquo;s Union by Michael Chabon\nDivisadero by Michael Ondaatje\nTree of Smoke by Denis Johnson\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz\n\u0026hellip; and a handful of others.\nThis could go on indefinitely, I realised. There is no point in simply asking over and over again for recommended books. Sooner or later people stop browsing and either buy a book or leave the shop. I decided to cap the number of requests at a random number (poor cat) between 1 and 20 - 12 on this occasion - and then listed in my notebook each of the dozen books I had picked from among the recommendations. Here is that list:\nSpecial Topics in Calamity Physics\nThe Yiddish Policemen\u0026rsquo;s Union: A Novel (P.S.)\nFalling Man: A Novel\nTree of Smoke: A Novel\nBridge of Sighs: A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)\nThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle: A Novel (Oprah Book Club #62)\nThe Art of Racing in the Rain\nThe Beach House\nChasing Harry Winston: A Novel\nCelebutantes\nRemember Me?\nLove the One You\u0026rsquo;re With\nThat, I decided, looked like one visit to Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s shop. Each book selected from the list was one I had \u0026ldquo;picked up\u0026rdquo; and skimmed (at least those parts Mr. Amazon lets me see). Moving along shelves, picking books up that are not too far from the place you stand. There was an undeniable similarity, albeit a pale imitation of the casual, unpredictable and whimsical act of browsing in what I still thought of as a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; bookshop.\nI decided to simulate a second visit. I know Mr. Amazon would have a few recommendations waiting for me, based on my previous visits, so I cat-picked one from the list of books I had \u0026ldquo;picked up\u0026rdquo; (Falling Man: A Novel) and generated a second list of books:\nFalling Man: A Novel\nDivisadero (Vintage International)\nThe Yiddish Policemen\u0026rsquo;s Union: A Novel (P.S.)\nFalling Man: A Novel\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\nTree of Smoke: A Novel\nLegacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA\nThe Post-American World\nThe Second World: Empires and Influence in the New Global Order\nThe New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East\nThe Return of History and the End of Dreams\nDangerous Nation: America\u0026rsquo;s Place in the World, from it\u0026rsquo;s Earliest Days to the Dawn of the 20th Century\nPower, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East: 1776 to the Present\nSix Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\nThe Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977\nSix Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\nThe Arab-Israeli Wars: War and Peace in the Middle East\nSome books, I noticed, were appearing again and again. Who on earth, I wondered, is this Oscar Wao whose brief wondrous life is appearing in all the lists I generate? And what is this Falling Man? I had heard of neither, yet Mr. Amazon seemed to be pushing them at me insistently. And how had I got from a literary mystery to what looked like nonfiction books about the near Orient? There was so much to think about in these lists that I copied the second list into my notebook and headed to my library to think, telling Google to bring me some smoked kippers, Turkish coffee, and the latest copy of the Literary Review. He bowed obsequiously, but not quickly enough to hide the supercilious smirk he sometimes gives, as if he knows not only what problems I seek to solve but the answers too. But this quest was becoming my own, and I did not want his help.\nIt was Jennie the one-legged housekeeper who climbed the worn stone steps of the western wing to my library in the turret, bringing the kippers, a wet copy of the Literary Review, and a half-empty cup of luke-warm coffee. It is most inconvenient that she is crippled and I shall have to do something about it - perhaps reassign her to the kitchen where she does not have to move about so much? But this is not the time to indulge myself in such sentimental nonsense, I told myself. My warm heart and generous nature is so well known locally that I fear they are often taken advantage of. I must make myself of sterner stuff. So I dismissed Jennie and turned to the Review.\nFirst, those two books. It turns out they were not so obscure as I thought. Falling Man is written by that impetuous youngster Don DeLillo, author of Underworld. And Oscar Wao won something called a Pulitzer Prize, that is apparently worthy of note in the provinces. Amazon, I was slightly chuffed to realise, was showing me books that were new to me, but - despite what I am often told is my encyclopedic knowledge - far from obscure. I could probably pick up either of those volumes at Words Worth or at Heather\u0026rsquo;s Big House O\u0026rsquo;Books.\nAnd how did we get from Special Topics to The Arab Israeli Wars? Via The Falling Man, it seems. That book is a literary novel (and so linked to Special Topics) and yet is concerned with terrorism, and so leads us into other books about warfare and terrorism. Not too far-fetched, I thought, and yet ingenious.\nAs I stretched in front of the library fire, the warmth and my exhertions combined to induce a sluggish drowsiness. I drifted in and out of a doze, my mind filled with pictures of endless lists of books, on topics leaping from terrorism to gourmet cooking to accounting in a few bounds. How could I impose some kind of order on this profligacy? What can one learn from this spewing of titles? How does Mr. Amazon impose order? He must, I was convinced, have some mechanism for governing the labours of those poor, enslaved mole-people deep in his basement-factories.\nJust before my dozing turned to sleep, I remembered one nugget of information that had come back along with the title in response to my requests - the SalesRank. This, I knew, is Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s seller list. But unlike a real best seller list, it does not stop at a mere ten or so items. Instead, as seems typical of Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s industrious nature, it goes on and on into the hundreds, the thousands, the hundreds of thousands, each book with its rank. That, I decided, would be the starting point for my next investigation.\n","date":1232967842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"c5d23c849f9045eedcfddbcce36a06f7","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-the-differ/","publishdate":"2009-01-26T11:04:02Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-the-differ/","section":"post","summary":"[This is the sixth instalment of Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop.

A list of all instalments is here; the previous instalment is here. This instalment was written over the Christmas holiday, well before Belkingate.]\nMy inability to understand how Amazon worked was the first step in an increasingly tormented relationship with the shop and its owner during the last few months. Two other events pushed me from by early enthusiasm with the peculiar place to a more antagonistic stance.\nFirst, one of the other bookstores in town closed down. Mr. Babbage\u0026rsquo;s Books with a Difference (Engine) stocked books that dealt particularly with my old hobby - the steam-driven monstrosity I had built in the stables, and with which I had tinkered on the weekends for years. I bumped into him on the street and he complained that the kids these days bought all their books at Amazon\u0026rsquo;s shop. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame - Mr. Babbage had recommended several good books to me when I visited his shop and also given me several tips at times when I got stuck in the construction of my difference engine. I felt that the world of books was a little poorer for his loss.\nThe second reason was harder to put my finger on. Even though Mr. Amazon was never at a loss for a book to recommend, I was increasingly disappointed at the predictability of his suggestions, and at the limits of his knowledge whenever I ventured into new areas.\nHe would recite the comments of others but I increasingly felt that he did so with little conviction. He did not know who these others were or why they wrote what they wrote. One day I asked him what he knew of The Secret History by Donna Tartt and he just told me that someone called A Customer had said that \u0026ldquo;The Secret History has been one of my favorite leisure-reading selections for several years\u0026rdquo;.\nI guffawed.\nHe went on to say that \u0026ldquo;Gary Marfin says it is a very powerful novel and Gary Marfin\u0026rsquo;s real name is, in fact, Gary Marfin.\u0026rdquo; But this told me little - does Gary Marfin have the same refined tastes I do? Unlikely, given that he apparently comes from some place called Sugar Land in Texas: a more un-Whimsley like location I can hardly imagine.\n\u0026ldquo;But what do you think, Amazon, what do you think?\u0026rdquo; I pestered. All he could come up with was that \u0026ldquo;329 of 539 customers gave this book five stars\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;So what?\u0026rdquo; I demanded, and actually stamped out of the shop in a huff.\nI decided it was time to resolve some of my contradictory impressions about Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop. Its virtue is clear - if you know a book he will find it for you. Its limitations are also clear - it is not a real bookshop, for all his postmodernist posturing, and one cannot browse the shelves. For special orders of books Mr. Amazon is impressive, but if I don\u0026rsquo;t go there with a book in mind then all I have to go on are his recommendations. And these, despite the enthusiasm of the young, seemed limited to me.\nMy brow was sorely furrowed all the way home. I fed raw rice to the ducks in the park, but could not even raise a chuckle at the thought of their discomfort as it swelled inside them. But as I approached Whimsley Hall and walked past the stables a thought struck me. Just before going out of business Mr. Babbage had told me that Mr. Amazon had a new trick - instead of going to Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop, one could use a difference engine to ask him as many questions as you like. Perhaps, I thought, I could tune my difference engine to ask him for all kinds of recommendations, and then I could get a deeper sense of what his shop augured for the world of books. I was so excited I almost started on this project right away, but my stressful excursion had quite worn me out and I retreated instead to my bedroom and a spoonful of laudanum. Next day, I told myself, I would start up my difference engine and ask a few more questions of Mr. Amazon.\n","date":1232475682,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1cd64563134ee2beec3a326a75f4511e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-doubts-about-amazon/","publishdate":"2009-01-20T18:21:22Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-doubts-about-amazon/","section":"post","summary":"[This is the fifth instalment of Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop.

A quick scan suggests that most are stillborn. See http://ned.blogspot.com/ or http://karim.blogspot.com/ for a couple of examples.\n 361 were born and died in 2000.\n 2001 and 2002 were the peak years for firstname blogs, with over 900 dying off each year. Not surprising that this is an early peak: the firstname places would be picked up quickly. Perhaps more surprising is that these blogs have been sitting there for 7 or 8 years, unattended, and blogger hasn\u0026rsquo;t done anything with them.\n The number of dying blogs falls off - meaning that the number of active ones does as well probably. Until now, only 96 blogs have been updated in the first three weeks of 2009.\n  96 out of 7489. That\u0026rsquo;s about one in 75 that are active. Pretty small numbers.\nHow does this silly survey compare with a bigger picture? The Technorati annual review of blogging for 2008 says that about 7.5 million blogs were updated in the 120 days before their report of 133 million that they have ever indexed: about one in 20 or so. Given the longer timeframe, not too bad a match. So 19 out of 20 blogs that have ever been started are now moribund.\nAnd here, for those of you who are interested, the 96 firstname blogs still going strong are listed at the end of this post.\nMy technorati ranking is about 33 at the moment but I have been as high as 90. That puts me, they say, in the top 1% of blogs. I get about 50 readers a day, many of whom are googlers who probably land here and don\u0026rsquo;t find what they are looking for. And, on generous average, about one comment per post, so 99 out of a hundred bloggers get few readers and no comments. If these people are a typical sample, maybe one of them gets a comment per post. Maybe you should choose one and say hello.\nelvina\nadger\nminta\ncindi\nworden\ndoretta\ngrover\ncarmen\ncharlton\nhildagarde\nmelesa\nlillian\nmiranda\ndelcina\nbarbette\nurbanus\ntina\njess\nroland\nbonny\nmadalyn\nvivi\ncorabella\nnikoletta\nfaunie\ncherey\nhenka\nterrill\nolive\nvalli\nkamila\ncherice\nlorette\ndaune\norville\nsella\njohnathon\naleecia\nmadelina\ndottie\ndario\nroselyn\nmerrie\namalea\nephraim\ntrey\nwerner\nantonino\nlevon\nlavina\nsaxe\ndouglas\nmeira\ndanila\nwinston\nlavinie\nteresita\nclovis\nchas\nletti\nanders\nedythe\naileen\nluanna\nhuntlee\nbancroft\nsidonnie\nfancie\nmarcelline\njoella\npauline\nengracia\noran\nkirk\nrhonda\nleonardo\nclaudia\nevette\nkris\nbird\nzia\nwilmette\nmerrel\nfitz\ncain\nlindy\nhope\ndwain\nmareah\nsara\nberkley\npinchas\njosselyn\nrobinett\noprah\nheidi\n","date":1232401264,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5145aee1951e45aa26234fb3e8132cbb","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/so-some-bloke-called-graham-emails-me-about-my-competition-and-he-says-like-why-dont-you-do-it-yourself-heres-a-list-of-na/","publishdate":"2009-01-19T21:41:04Z","relpermalink":"/post/so-some-bloke-called-graham-emails-me-about-my-competition-and-he-says-like-why-dont-you-do-it-yourself-heres-a-list-of-na/","section":"post","summary":"So some bloke called Graham emails me about my competition and he says, like, why don\u0026rsquo;t you do it yourself then?

A list of all instalments is here; the previous instalment is here.]\nThe next day I woke early, Google\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop was founded on an illusion still hammering in my head. I decided that this puzzle needed to be solved and, unlike so many ideas that come on the threshold of sleep, my notion from the previous evening still seemed like a filly with legs. After breakfasting on the usual kippers, tea, and toast with ginger marmalade, I dressed and rushed into the village. I ducked into Words Worth and scanned the advertisements in the Literary Review until I found what I wanted: an announcement from Gallup Press promoting a new book entitled \u0026ldquo;Strengths-Based Leadership\u0026rdquo;. It sounded like the most ridiculous form of business-speaking, self-help-inspired, positive-thinking twaddle, but the announcement brandished a ribbon-like slash across one corner proclaiming \u0026ldquo;Coming Soon!\u0026rdquo; with a date about two months hence - and that\u0026rsquo;s all I needed.\nI rushed out of the door, strode down the street, and marched into Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop. I walked straight up to his desk and stared him in the eye. \u0026ldquo;Right then Amazon\u0026rdquo;, I said loudly, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like a copy of Strengths-Based Leadership, pronto.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Certainly sir.\u0026rdquo; He reached down behind his desk again and lifted up a book, \u0026ldquo;Here it is. Would you like to pre-order it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aha!\u0026rdquo; I shouted, pointing at the supposed book. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got you! That\u0026rsquo;s not a real book. It\u0026rsquo;s not even published yet. And if that\u0026rsquo;s not a real book, then you\u0026rsquo;re not a real bookshop! You\u0026rsquo;re just a, a\u0026hellip;. glorified catalogue!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course it\u0026rsquo;s a book sir. You can look at the cover, you can order it, and although it may take a little longer to arrive than some other books, it will arrive. If it\u0026rsquo;s not a book, then what could it be? Kippers and toast with ginger marmalade?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If it were a book, then I could touch it.\u0026rdquo; I grabbed at it across the desk, but Amazon was too quick for me and pulled it back. \u0026ldquo;See!\u0026rdquo; I cried, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a trick! I know it\u0026rsquo;s a trick!\u0026rdquo;\nHe was unflustered. \u0026ldquo;Sorry sir, you may not touch the books in our store, but feel free to read the back cover. Or I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to open it for you to look inside.\u0026rdquo;\nI stammered.\n\u0026ldquo;Excuse me sir,\u0026rdquo; he smiled patronizingly at me. \u0026ldquo;If I may make so bold, you seem to have a very old-fashioned idea of existence. What is a book anyway? Is it a physical lump of ink, paper and glue and card? Or is it the words, the ideas, the tale-well-told? When you buy a book, what is it you are purchasing? Printer\u0026rsquo;s ink and cheap paper, or a connection with the fertile mind of an author?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What you think of as a book\u0026rdquo;, he carried on in a patronizing manner, \u0026ldquo;is simply a replica, a particular physical manifestation of a book. Do you think a mere copy of one manifestation is the original, the archetypal, book? Certainly not - the physical object you so covet is the essence of duplicity; claiming to be a book and yet, in reality, being nothing but a grubby knock-off, a derivative product that supplements the elemental text with what is usually a poorly-chosen font and badly-illustrated covers. The real thing - the authentic book - is in the ether.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Many would say that books live, not between the covers, but in the conception of their authors - theirs is the heart that beats, the insight that inspires. Even those postmodernists you are so keen on, those who would dismiss authorial intent - even they would claim that a book is the text itself, not its physical manifestation in font and paper. And not only is your precious book itself an illusion but so is your crude idea of some real bookshop from which it is sold. There is nothing, I understand, beyond the text. And I,\u0026rdquo; (did his eyes glisten as he said those words?) \u0026ldquo;I have the text.\u0026rdquo;\nUsually so reserved, I had never seen him display this kind of intensity before and it quite took me aback. I had nothing to say in response. Before I could gather my wits he leant forward: \u0026ldquo;Let me tell you something, for your ears only\u0026rdquo;, he whispered, \u0026ldquo;the physical book you love so much is dead. What you see here, delivering books to you by post,\u0026rdquo; (did he sneer at the word \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;?) \u0026ldquo;this is just the beginning. My shelves are infinite. A book, as you will see, is nothing but a drop of condensation in the Cloud. And I,\u0026rdquo; (Did his teeth twinkle as he smiled?) \u0026ldquo;I have the Cloud.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well then,\u0026rdquo; I riposted bravely, gathering myself together. \u0026ldquo;If the grubby item you are sending me is not a real book, you won\u0026rsquo;t mind if I don\u0026rsquo;t pay you in this grubby money?\u0026rdquo; I waved two ten guinea coins under his nose and then put them ostentatiously back in my waistcoat pocket.\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely not sir. A credit card suits us better.\u0026rdquo;\nI spluttered, reduced to inarticulate mumbling, and was about to storm out, feeling that he had got the better of me again, when he spoke yet again.\n\u0026ldquo;May I ask, sir. Do you believe I am real?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You? I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; I admitted, \u0026ldquo;I suspect if I reached over the desk you would withdraw yourself quick enough. So how can I know? Tell me then, are you corporeal, or an illusion?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am as real as you are, sir.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well that\u0026rsquo;s a relief. At least I know I\u0026rsquo;m the real thing\u0026rdquo;, I chuckled.\n\u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rdquo;, he continued, \u0026ldquo;if I may make so bold, are hardly authentic are you? Not very original? Your language is a pale imitation of Sir Henry at Rawlinson End without the wit or the puns, your dress reminds me of Uncle Andrew from A Magician\u0026rsquo;s Nephew, your stick-like knees are nothing but Mervyn Peake\u0026rsquo;s Mr. Flay and I believe I detect a touch of Robert X. Cringely thrown in for good measure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need to be original. I\u0026rsquo;m real.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see. How convenient. Please come again. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you will.\u0026rdquo;\nAs I stepped into the gloomy summer rain of Whimsley High Street my mind was whirling. At least, it would have been if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been busy swilling down some bad cognac to slow it down. Is Amazon a real bookshop? Is there such a thing as a real bookshop? Is Mr. Amazon real?

Lawrence Lessig\u0026rsquo;s latest book is about how \u0026ldquo;a regime of copyright built for a radically different technological age\u0026rdquo; xvi: numbers in square brackets are page numbers] is inhibiting art, culture, and individual expression in a digital world. His inspiration, as a parent of two youngsters, is the \u0026ldquo;copyright wars\u0026rdquo; and the effect they are having on a generation of children and young adults. Copyright does have an important role to play, he argues, but Criminalizing an entire generation is too high a price to pay for a copyright system created more than a generation ago\u0026rdquo; [xviii].\nSurprisingly, given the author, the legal portion of the book is a relatively short final section, in which he outlines some common sense and practical suggestions for change in the regulatory environment of the USA. Instead, most of Remix is a description of what Lessig sees as the nascent and booming digital R/W culture that is under threat; of what kind of new activities are appearing and how they work economically. Lessig is mainly concerned with amateur activities like playing, hobbies, and gossip, and with how digital technology has changed them. Unfortunately, the picture he paints is less full of insight than his legal views. He paints a familiar heavily-photoshopped picture of reality that has now become almost orthodoxy in business and technological circles. Lessig\u0026rsquo;s views on culture and how it works include no references to the many writers who have thought long and hard about the subject. No Marshall McLuhan or Raymond Williams or their successors here. Instead, in what is an unfortunate Silicon Valley tendency, he simply ignores the history of the subject and decides to concoct his own ideas about cultures past and future, using \u0026ldquo;the language of today\u0026rsquo;s computer geeks\u0026rdquo;.\nHe divides culture, in an appropriately binary approach, into two forms. There is RO (read-only) culture: professionally produced, hierarchical, and characterized by control. In RO culture the role of amateurs is to consume \u0026ldquo;tokens of culture\u0026rdquo; (recordings, broadcasts and so on). Then there is RW culture (Read/Write), in which the consumers are also creators. RW culture is the domain of both professional and amateur, it is participatory.\nThe 20th Century, _Remix _says, saw the RO/RW pendulum swing sharply towards hierarchical and professional RO culture: \u0026ldquo;Never before in the history of human culture had the production of culture been as professionalized. Never before had its production been as concentrated\u0026rdquo; [29]. The 21st Century, driven by digital technologies, promises a revival of RW culture, a swing of the pendulum back to a more healthy balance. Healthy because the Internet \u0026ldquo;enables a wider range of people to speak\u0026rdquo; [132] and gives a new literacy to amateurs, who can \u0026ldquo;create in contexts that before only professionals ever knew\u0026rdquo; [108]. In short, the Internet promises to \u0026rdquo;democratize\u0026rdquo; culture by reviving RW forms.\nIn painting this picture _Remix _unfortunately airbrushes out all the RW culture happening in the 20th century and magnifies the new forms of RW culture emerging in the 21st. As a result it portrays what is actually a shift of activity, from some forms of RW culture to others, as a revival of RW culture.\nWe can imagine R/W culture as a pyramid of creative activities. Billions of people (including children) take part in creative activities casually, for fun, and we call that \u0026ldquo;play\u0026rdquo;. A small fraction of those people also take part more intensively and with more skill as a means of self-expression and we call those activities \u0026rdquo;hobbies\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;interests\u0026rdquo;. A very few skilled people become semi-amateur or professional and even fewer still become rich and famous. A healthy, \u0026ldquo;democratized\u0026rdquo; culture supports all the levels of this pyramid.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think about the broad base: play. When my teenage self painted a model airplane, or when my children modify a computer game, we are engaging in exactly the amateur creative activity Lessig labels W: we are manipulating \u0026ldquo;tokens of culture\u0026rdquo;. The big difference between my children\u0026rsquo;s creative pastimes and mine is that theirs, being digital, can be distributed by and monitored by other computers. Three things follow from this.\nFirst, their activities can be counted, and this gives the appearance of a huge growth of new cultural activity (millions of videos on YouTube! millions of photos on Flickr!) But such numbers are largely illusory. Most songs and videos are only ever seen or heard by a handful of friends and family, and this kind of small-scale sharing is really no more dramatic than me painting my airplane and showing it to my family and friends. It\u0026rsquo;s just easier to count.\nSecond, and this is Lessig\u0026rsquo;s main concern: the law can monitor and control digital play. Many creative activities, like creating music, require us to copy the works, either digitally on a computer or recreating songs on our own instruments. All such activity potentially triggers copyright concerns. Even consuming digital works, as Lessig points out, involves a form of copying the material from one place (a disk) to another (RAM) and processing it. DRM technology embedded in the files themselves, limit the ways in which a work can be copied and processed, even the number of times it can be processed. For material shared in public places, software can search and locate instances of songs, videos, and report back to the copyright owner. The intrusion of law and regulation further into our pastimes and hobbies than ever before is a development full of foreboding, and Remix is at its strongest when drawing attention to the intrusion and the dangers it brings with it. There is, to paraphrase Pierre Trudeau, no place for the state in the playrooms of the nation, and Remix is a strong argument for keeping it out.\nThere is a third change brought about by digital technology. It makes it possible for a few people to make unprecedented amounts of money from other people playing. As with the law, it is now possible to make money not just by selling us a toy to play with, but each and every time we play with it. Facebook, Youtube and other sites are, as Remix admits, increasingly driven by advertising. While Lessig is incensed at the raising of a generation of criminals, he is unfazed at the thought of raising a generation of commodities, whose attention and interest is a source of revenue for some venture capitalist. At a time when advertising directly to children is under increasing scrutiny, and for good reason, the commodification of friendship and of home videos should make a parent of young children concerned. But it does not.\nThe serious amateur and the part-time professional occupy a layer just above play in the cultural pyramid. In the non-digital world such a person may play in a band at local bars, or sing in local choirs. They may take singing or guitar lessons, or photography classes. They may even write a rarely-read book. These activities are valuable to the performers themselves and to their audience. Lessig is correct and articulate in arguing that the most dramatic benefit of cultural activity is not in the production of great works, but in large numbers of people finding their voice. These marginal but serious activities also generate income for the heavily-populated lower-income rungs of the professional ladder, as choirmasters, guitar teachers, book editors, sound technicians. In short, these small-scale public activities create the market for the \u0026ldquo;institutions of literacy\u0026rdquo; that Lessig correctly points out [108] are so important to the development of a healthy culture.\nIn the digital world, there is little place for these small-scale activities. Small-scale publishers and bookshops are derided by the digitocracy as \u0026ldquo;gatekeepers\u0026rdquo;, a purely negative function, while Netflix and Amazon are hailed as promoters of democratization. Nothing could be further from the truth: Netflix will never organize zombie walks in October as my local independent video store does; Amazon will never organize author tours for both eminent and marginal authors, as my local indepedent bookstore does. These stores are not \u0026ldquo;gatekeepers\u0026rdquo;; they are a central part of a healthy \u0026ldquo;democratized\u0026rdquo; culture. There is a whole rich ecosystem of activities, some paid, some not, around the production of small-scale culture, that Internet evangelists repeatedly ignore as they contrast the blandness of 20th century mainstream TV with the quirkiness of some favourite marginal Internet production. But the mainstream is still here in 2009, helped along by Netflix and Google and Amazon. And marginal, countercultural and avant-garde culture has a long history before Tim-Berners Lee.\nAmazon and Netflix\u0026rsquo;s economic efficiency derives from the automation of cultural work: carrying out the functions of distribution and promotion without having to pay people to do it. It may be inevitable, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it welcome. You\u0026rsquo;re a student and want to talk to someone at Netflix? Too bad, because their contact page says \u0026ldquo;If you are a student, we are unable at this time to grant requests for interviews.\u0026rdquo; In the 21st century the money that would have kept enthusiasts involved and employed in promoting culture is going, as our culture moves more online, to a few very wealthy people in Seattle and Silicon Valley. Democratization? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another trope that has become received wisdom in the world of the Internet: it is surprising that people take part in creative activity for free. As if joining in a game of football or painting a picture is surprising. Tied to economics as many are - the discipline that has the least insight into human motivations of all social sciences - they ask what the incentives are to build RW culture [116]? But, as Grant and Wood explain in their excellent book \u0026ldquo;Blockbusters and Trade Wars\u0026rdquo;, supply has never been the bottleneck for a healthy culture. Mississipi John Hurt had nothing but a harmonica - not even sight - yet he produced music, along with other talented musicians from all kinds of backgrounds and traditions. People find ways to create culture.\nThe bottleneck, instead, is in finding an audience. Promotion, seen in Remix as a technical matching problem to be solved by automated recommender systems, is the key to the cultural puzzle. And it is not yet proven that the Amazon\u0026rsquo;s and Netflixes of the world are better ways of promoting a diverse culture than the messy mix of older, smaller-scale institutions.\nLessig\u0026rsquo;s optimism regarding the future of serious amateurs and part-time professionals comes from his conviction that the worlds of the amateur and the professional can be reconciled on the Internet in the form of \u0026ldquo;hybrid economies\u0026rdquo;, where sharing and selling coexist side by side. Such mixtures are vulnerable, as he recognizes. Those who would contribute happily to non-profit Wikipedia do not contribute so happily if the fruits of their efforts are being pocketed by others.\nA key chapter of the book is devoted to classifying these sharing and commercial economies; labelling them as communities and community spaces and collaboration spaces. Unfortunately the result is a smattering of examples of attempts to mix money and non-commercial motivations, with varying degrees of success, and little to back up his conviction that the future will see a happy and democratic creation of hybrid models in which creators and platform owners each benefit.\nLessig describes himself as a Lefty, but it is a leftyness of a peculiar Silicon Valley type in these pages. If we take leftyness as being on the side of the underdog, then his attitude to copyright law and regulation makes sense: copyright law can be a way for big companies to limit little people.\nBut while Lessig doesn\u0026rsquo;t like \u0026ldquo;professionalism\u0026rdquo;, he has no problem with free markets, or with the commodification of increasing swaths of our lives. His vision of the future of hybrid economies is uncritical. He adopts a Silicon Valley anti-establishment stance by saying that, given a choice between the successful dinosaurs or the hungry upstarts \u0026ldquo;my taste is for the hungry upstarts\u0026rdquo; [142]. But given a choice between independent bookstores and Amazon, he\u0026rsquo;s on the side of Amazon and sees the small publisher as \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; and part of the old, RO culture.\nFor many cultural and artistic movements there is a \u0026ldquo;counter-cultural moment\u0026rdquo; when a previously obscure and out-of-the-way tendency suddenly gains prominence. It may be the surrealists in the \u0026lsquo;30s, Bauhaus in the \u0026lsquo;20s, the hippy movement in the late \u0026lsquo;60s, punk in the late \u0026lsquo;70s - each had a few years in which it was both important and yet still opposed to the mainstream. But that counter-cultural moment is short, often just a handful of years, and once it is over, the movement either becomes the mainstream or fades away. Only nine years after the summer of \u0026lsquo;67 the hippies were a thing of the past and punk set itself up in direct opposition to the pompous and irrelevant dinosaurs that \u0026ldquo;progressive rock\u0026rdquo; bands had become.\n\u0026ldquo;Geek culture\u0026rdquo; has had its counter-cultural moment. It\u0026rsquo;s over.\nIt is now several years since Wikipedia started, four years since blogging, ten years of Google. When it talks of \u0026ldquo;hungry upstarts\u0026rdquo; _Remix _lists Google, Yahoo! and other companies formed by Stanford dropouts, but a few years on, these upstarts (to the extent that Stanford vs Harvard [142] was ever a battle of underdog vs establishment) are now the establishment. Netflix partners with Wal-Mart, Google partners with CBS, Amazon is bigger than any of those \u0026rdquo;establishment\u0026rdquo; bookstores it challenged and pushes around publishers with impunity. Geek culture is now mainstream. Google, Amazon, Netflix have passed their counterculture sell-by date.\nLessig is recognized as a leader of admirable efforts to introduce copyright reform issue. The legal reforms which he briefly sketches in the final part of the book are well thought out and practical: deregulating amateur creativity, establishing clear title, simplifying copyright, decriminalizing the copy, and decriminalizing file sharing. His suggestions for changes we need to our norms are also fine so far as they go: extending the norms that govern text (the right to quote small parts of text for example) [275] to other areas of culture where there is no such leeway [104]; making copyright \u0026ldquo;opt-in\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026rdquo;opt-out\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;rediscovering the limits of regulation\u0026rdquo;. But that last one is a marker of the failings of the book. Ironically timed, given the current financial mess, Remix misses the point that we need also to learn the limits of markets, and the dangers of commodification.\n","date":1231968275,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"2f5611da40d1d066bdd290c3dec206b9","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/lawrence-lessigs-remix-a-rambling-review/","publishdate":"2009-01-14T21:24:35Z","relpermalink":"/post/lawrence-lessigs-remix-a-rambling-review/","section":"post","summary":"_Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy,_ Lawrence Lessig, Penguin 2008.

I often hinted to the man behind the desk that I would like to know, but he ignored me. I even asked him once in a direct and semi-serious manner: \u0026ldquo;what do you have down there behind that desk Amazon? How do you get these books? Is it mole-people, Amazon? Do you have hoards hordes of mole-people slaving in darkness down below, running back and forth in some gigantic basement-warehouse bringing you the books you need?\u0026rdquo; He smiled vaguely. \u0026ldquo;Not at all sir.

Mr. Amazon has set up shops in every city, town and village I can think of. And in each one they look the same. A desk, a person, and an empty room, and yet he produces the books you are looking for when you ask. Some people say all these stores are connected by a series of tubes that run from one to another underground, so books can be shipped from one to another at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;With mole-people, right! Mole-people with preternaturally strong forearms pushing trolleys underground from shop to shop! I knew it!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Er no, sir.

I received this nice email from sys-con\u0026rsquo;s Jeremy Geelan (\u0026ldquo;Sr. Vice-President, Editorial and Events\u0026rdquo;):\nWould you be cool with our republishing the post below in full, with your byline and bio (plus a link back to the original URL) at http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com?\nhttp://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2008/10/cloudy-monopolies-ii.html\n\nWe try and do this across all our many and varied sites from time to time by adding insightful posts by writers outside our immediate circle. It\u0026rsquo;s our way of introducing fresh new voices and technologies to our audience\u0026hellip;\nSo, let us know, yes? Thank you - meantime have a great Tuesday! :)\nJeremy G.\nA colleague of mine has been to a couple of conferences organized by sys-con. A quick look at their website suggested they are one of those gazillion or so Silicon Valley tech. news sites. So I thought, OK, I know there\u0026rsquo;s no money, and I\u0026rsquo;m displacing real columnists and it\u0026rsquo;s digital sharecropping, but let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes. I said OK and they republished the post. No one came through to my blog from their publication, which surprised me, and I did have to tell them to remove a copyright notice which claimed copyright for sys-con, which should have warned me off, but so it goes.\nThen in December I looked at my incoming traffic and saw someone had come from Yacht Vacations and Charters Magazine, which also includes my post here. I have no interest in my name being associated with anything that looks like a front for advertising junk so I wrote to sys-con at the email address they provided (seta@sys-con.com) saying this:\nI recently gave permission for SYS-CON to reproduce a piece of mine in a journal on cloud computing. I now see it posted as a commentary in Yacht, Vacation, and Charters magazine. It is completely inappropriate for that place and I did not give permission for its use in that context. Please remove it.\nThe piece I am referring to can be found at http://www.yachtchartersmagazine.com/node/725544.\nThe email bounced. I sent it to another sys-con email address I found. I heard nothing.\nThen yesterday I get someone coming to my blog from a third sys-con \u0026ldquo;magazine\u0026rdquo;, CRM (\u0026ldquo;The First and Only Independent Magazine Serving CRM Developers\u0026rdquo;): from here to be precise. Also inappropriate, also without permission. Plain wrong.\nSo I googled some text in the article, and it turns out that sys-con has posted my piece on 19 different sites (here is the list).\nI guess I could ask them to remove it again, but this is so obviously bad faith that I\u0026rsquo;ll just post this and unleash the awesome power of my internet influence instead. Plus, when I get back to work, I\u0026rsquo;ll write to the marketing people at work and tell them to stay well away from sys-con.\nEmphasis on the con.\n","date":1231690682,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"25924c8a74c6a91213224c403a52b158","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/syscon-media-is-an-appalling-and-shameless-outfit-avoid-it/","publishdate":"2009-01-11T16:18:02Z","relpermalink":"/post/syscon-media-is-an-appalling-and-shameless-outfit-avoid-it/","section":"post","summary":"Sys-con is commonly treated as a legitimate media organization.

But in a couple of days the book I had ordered (Special Topics in Calamity Physics, if you recall) did arrive with the post. Over the next few days I read it, and thoroughly enjoyed it despite the pretensions of the author (I do have a keen eye for pretentiousness), so my feelings for Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s bookshop were mollified a little.\nMr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s shop was frustrating, but over time I discovered that it also had an undeniable appeal. If I was shopping for a particular book and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it, I soon got used to dropping in at the odd little store and asking Mr. Amazon if he had it. And no matter what I asked, whether it was Nigella Lawson\u0026rsquo;s How to Eat or Kieran Healy\u0026rsquo;s Last Best Gifts, he would just reach down behind his desk and come up with the book, holding it up for me to look at. I became accustomed to the no-touch rule. I would have preferred to leaf through the book before buying it, but I\u0026rsquo;d look at the blurbs on the back, and sometimes he would open up the book so I could see a few pages inside. Then he would take my money, although not before giving one of his recommendations. Usually I would ignore these, but every now and again I would take him up on one. Who could resist a modest suggestion that \u0026ldquo;You know sir, some people who bought Last Best Gifts also bought Catherine Waldby\u0026rsquo;s Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism. Would you be interested in that too?\u0026rdquo; I said yes and he reached down beneath his desk and showed it to me, before putting all the books away again and taking my money.\nIt is true that I could have ordered these books from any of the other stores in the village, but the ones I ordered from Mr. Amazon did usually arrive quicker and cheaper than the others and I got used to relying on him for those books I needed. I still used the other bookstores if I wanted to browse around but went to Amazon\u0026rsquo;s if I knew what I wanted.\nOne day I walked into the shop and noticed that there were a few books lying open on the desk in front of Mr. Amazon. I walked over to them and teased him: \u0026ldquo;Getting sloppy are we Amazon? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t these be put away below your desk there?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Not at all sir\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;I saw you coming and took the liberty of putting out a few books you might like. Would you care to look at these?\u0026rdquo; And would you know it, I ended up buying one.\nI think that visit, almost a year after my first encounter, was when I started to look to Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s store first, rather than using it as a last resort. I\u0026rsquo;d walk in, go straight up to the desk (oddly enough there was never anyone else in the shop) and see what selection he had put out for me. Usually they weren\u0026rsquo;t any good, but I could always say \u0026ldquo;Amazon, old chap, do you happen to have \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and he would inevitably reach down behind his desk and produce the very book, usually murmuring something like \u0026ldquo;Some people who bought this also bought\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and mentioning another book or two.\nThat was almost two years ago, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been a regular customer of Mr. Amazon since then. And I\u0026rsquo;m far from alone. Mr. Amazon has gained a lot of other fans in the village, especially among the young folk. In fact, they seem to see him as more than just a convenient place to buy books; he\u0026rsquo;s become something of a hero to them. Somehow Mr. Amazon, neatly pressed shirts and all, has gained a reputation as a bit of a rebel, and we all know there\u0026rsquo;s nothing like a streak of the maverick to make youngsters turn their heads.\nThe first time I noticed this admiration was last spring, as the snow melted to leave the familiar spring-time odour of dog turds on every corner. I was out in the park putting out my usual batch of arsenic-laced sausages to dissuade the villagers from letting their curs roam free, when I heard the scamps on the way home from their schoolhouse, boisterously boasting about what they were going to do when they grew up. \u0026ldquo;No crappy old publisher is going to stand between my novel and its audience!\u0026rdquo; I heard one young Jane Austen exclaim, as she kicked her chum affectionately in the groin, \u0026ldquo;Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s going to tell the whole world about it.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah. Don\u0026rsquo;t you just hate publishers? Damn those gatekeepers. But elitist institutions won\u0026rsquo;t hold the new generation back!\u0026rdquo; countered her pal as he picked himself up off the ground. \u0026ldquo;Right!\u0026rdquo; said a third, \u0026ldquo;Mass media is so over. Who needs it when Mr. Amazon is on your side?\u0026rdquo; I smiled at their japes, watching as they ripped the sleeves off the jacket of a hapless and chubby twelve-year-old, smirking at him: \u0026ldquo;Look at you now, you\u0026rsquo;re just like Random House. \u0026lsquo;armless!\u0026rdquo;\nAh, such idealism! It took me right back to being pelted with stones by that Blemings lad as I scrambled across the rocks under the weir on the way home from school. Happy days!\nTheir enthusiasm was winning. Could it be, I wondered, that Mr. Amazon was going to open a new world of literature ahead of us? That the balance of power had tilted and that the author, the primary creative force, who I must admit has been so long unfairly neglected by the establishment publishing houses in the big cities of the world, finally had the upper hand? Could those authors (and don\u0026rsquo;t forget the charming authoresses!), with the tyranny of the old world left behind, usher in a new world of variety and diversity? Oh, I did so hope it might be so!\nBut if Mr. Amazon was the key to a new culture, how did he manage it? Try as I might, I could not guess how the little man could always reach to find just the book I asked for. And how had he, a rather prim and proper middle-aged man with none of the attractive whiff of dissipation I possess, gained the attention and even affection of the Scruffiest Generation? I decided that, in fairness to those village shopkeepers I had frequented for years, I should put my hopes of a brave new world on hold until I knew what was going on\u0026hellip;\n","date":1231180913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"e2bc79fd2b9362ec09224f45f315035d","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-the-appeal-of-amazon/","publishdate":"2009-01-05T18:41:53Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-the-appeal-of-amazon/","section":"post","summary":"[The table of contents for Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop is here]\nAfter my previous visit to Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop I was furious the whole way home, and wrote the man off as a charletan charlatan.

Mice chase spiders, earwigs and silverfish over the piles of discarded plates and glasses that are the inevitable aftermath of the annual party I throw for the villagers. The children have played their last game of Pin the Tail on the Vicar, and have vanished, thank God. I am sure some of the greedy little bastards steal my silverware; I know that the older children use Hide and Seek as an excuse to search through my erotica collection. And their parents are worse; they pretend to be friendly but I know they are only after the contents of my cellar, and to a one they seem to have a huge capacity for drink and other forms of debauchery. But they too are finally gone. People think I am fortunate, living in this picturesque and rambling manor, but the duties of the landed gentry are not easily shirked, and so year after year I spend the days between Christmas and New Year\u0026rsquo;s sitting at my desk with aching head and foul breath. Usually I spend these days reading a book, but this year I do not have a single one that takes my fancy. The reason is simple: I refuse to buy my books from a certain popular bookshop in town. Small wonder that as I sit, my mind is wandering back to a similar post-Christmas event a few years ago\u0026hellip;\nI had decided, that day, to walk from Whimsley Hall down into the village. I hoped that the unseasonably fresh air would clean away my own hangover and would also get me away from the Hall while the servants cleaned away the bacchanalian refuse. I would willingly help them of course, but their nature is coarser than mine so it only makes sense to leave them to it.\nI am a regular visitor to each of the village book shops and I wanted to pick up a novel or two. We had a lot of bookstores in Whimsley village until recently. One specialized in mysteries, one in politics, one in books about my hobby (Mr. Babbage\u0026rsquo;s Books with a Difference (Engine)), and there were a couple of second hand stores as well. Then there\u0026rsquo;s Words Worth the general bookstore and Heather\u0026rsquo;s Big House O\u0026rsquo;Books, a big but crass place I avoid when I can, but with an undeniably good selection. And if I\u0026rsquo;m in a hurry for a page-turner I can always pick up a best seller at the supermarket (you didn\u0026rsquo;t think we had a supermarket did you? Oh yes, we\u0026rsquo;re up to date in Whimsley village). So we were well provided for. I really didn\u0026rsquo;t think there was room for another book shop, but I had heard from Google - my butler and the source of a remarkable range of odd facts and fancies - of a new shop in town called Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop and I decided, being the open-minded chap I am, to give it a try.\nGoogle had told me that Mr. Amazon has the most amazing selection of books, so you can imagine how surprised I was when I walked in the door. Mr. Amazon is famous now, so you probably know what his shop looks like, but in case you haven\u0026rsquo;t been there let me tell you. The door is unprepossessing. Once inside there\u0026rsquo;s a bare wooden floor. No books, no shelves. It\u0026rsquo;s always empty of people. There are a couple of posters on the wall, and a short, trim middle-aged man, dressed smartly but informally, sits straight-backed behind a high desk. That first day I shook my umbrella to hide my confusion and nearly turned to leave, but then I thought it would be rude just to walk out so I asked him a question.\n\u0026ldquo;Excuse me, I seem to have stepped into the wrong place. I thought this was a book shop.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is,\u0026rdquo; said the man behind the desk. \u0026ldquo;And a very fine one I\u0026rsquo;m proud to say.\u0026rdquo;\nWas the man mad? I squinted at him though my monocle but he looked calm enough. I gestured at the empty room and addressed him again.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, most bookshops have - you know - books. You don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have any at all! There\u0026rsquo;s not a single shelf in sight!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;On the contrary sir, we have the finest collection of books in the village. We are aware of all books, we just don\u0026rsquo;t have shelves. Is there one you would like to see?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not one in particular, I just thought I\u0026rsquo;d look around - see what you specialize in, you know. See what your collection\u0026rsquo;s like. But, I\u0026rsquo;ve just realized I\u0026rsquo;m late for\u0026hellip; something - got to be going. Toodle pip!\u0026rdquo;\nI turned to leave, but he spoke before I got out of the door.\n\u0026ldquo;We are aware of all books sir. Any book you like, we have it. Is there one you would like to see?\u0026rdquo;\nHis words were so peculiar I decided that the butler was playing a trick on me. He\u0026rsquo;d sent me here to see this batty little man as a joke. Obviously the proprietor was touched in the head. I just shook my head and exited.\nI forgot all about Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s bookshop for a couple of months, and then an odd circumstance found me making a second visit. My plumber, a retired scholar, is a regular source of book recommendations. When I ask her how she can stand dealing with the contents of Whimsley Hall\u0026rsquo;s bathrooms after studying Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s sonnets she just looks at me and shakes her head and says \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a long time since you were at a university isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Anyway, she had told me about a new novel called Special Topics in Calamity Physics, which was apparently a hit in America and which both she and her husband had enjoyed. I\u0026rsquo;d been to a couple of the bookshops in the village but they both said they hadn\u0026rsquo;t got it yet. Disappointed, I was on my way home when I realized I was walking right by Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop. Truth to tell, I was surprised to see it still there. \u0026ldquo;Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s actually got some books now\u0026rdquo;, I thought as I walked in through the door. And I was confronted with the empty, hardwood-floored room and that funny little man sitting pertly behind his desk, just as before.\n\u0026ldquo;Still no books I see?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;On the contrary sir,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;We are aware of all books, we just don\u0026rsquo;t have shelves. Is there one you would like to see?\u0026rdquo;\nThe man was obviously run by clockwork or mad as a hatter, but I thought I\u0026rsquo;d amuse myself a little.\n\u0026ldquo;Well actually there is. I\u0026rsquo;m looking for Special Topics in Calamity Physics by Marisha Pessl. It\u0026rsquo;s new and the other shops don\u0026rsquo;t have it yet. Maybe you could point me to it?\u0026rdquo;\nI confess I smiled a little as I turned theatrically around, as if scanning the shelves. But quick as a kingfisher the little man reached under his desk, brought out a book, and held it out in front of him. \u0026ldquo;Ah yes, a fine choice. Here it is. Two hundred and sixty four of our customers have told us about this book, and 149 gave it more than three stars out of five. Take a look.\u0026rdquo;\nI stepped forward and reached for the book, but he pulled it away.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry sir, you may not touch the books in our store, but feel free to read the back cover as I hold it. Or I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to open it for you to look inside.\u0026rdquo;\nI was surprised and a little offended, but at least he had the book.\n\u0026ldquo;Never mind, I\u0026rsquo;ll take it\u0026rdquo;, I muttered, putting a few guineas on the desk.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you sir. Good Day.\u0026rdquo; And with that he put the book back beneath the desk.\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you forgetting something?\u0026rdquo; I said sharply. \u0026ldquo;My book?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No sir. We deliver our books. You will receive yours shortly. Good day. By the way, customers who bought Special Topics in Calamity Physics also bought The Secret History by Donna Tartt and Absurdistan by Gary Shteyngart. Would you be interested?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I should think not! Just see to it that my book is delivered, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u0026rdquo; And I stamped out furiously, cursing the difficulty of getting good service these days.\n","date":1230722341,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"96fd39ae60310886822c68f3ddfc7a13","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-first-visits/","publishdate":"2008-12-31T11:19:01Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-amazons-bookshop-first-visits/","section":"post","summary":"[The table of contents for Mr. Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Bookshop is here]\nWhimsley Hall is never a salubrious place, but in the days following Christmas it is truly disgusting.

You Are Just Slow.\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Here is a quandary in three parts. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to think about it clearly, much less how to resolve it.\nPart 1 is a letter in today\u0026rsquo;s Globe and Mail from Charles Cook:\nImagine settling down in a nice theatre seat only to have Marge Simpson sit in front of you. Thirty years ago, my balcony afforded a good view of Lake Ontario and the Toronto Harbour. Gradual infill building has blocked it all but I proudly boast of what is left, a view of the CN Tower.\nWith a watchful eye on high-rise projects, I got wind of a new mega condo to be built between me and this Toronto icon. When (or now, if) it\u0026rsquo;s completed, my iconic view will be gone. New condo buyers everywhere should not be influenced by artists\u0026rsquo; impressions of the view from an unbuilt living room. Marge Simpson may be their first guest.\nThe letter writer may suffer from Marge Simpson\u0026rsquo;s towering blue hairdo in front of him, but he seems blind to the fact that he is a Marge Simpson in front of someone else. And the first condo building is probably more of an issue than the hundred and first. It\u0026rsquo;s a vanguard of corruption.\nPart 2 is the occasional appearance of groups called something like \u0026ldquo;Artists Against Gentrification\u0026rdquo; (for Detroit see here). It\u0026rsquo;s a concept that is easy to mock. Seeking out cheap space in neighbourhoods that are not their own, yet which offer cultural novelty and distinctiveness, some artists like to think of themselves as champions of authentic neighbourhoods. Others cast them as the ground troops that come in first, paving the way for upscale developers.\nBut part 3 is more difficult for me to mock. The place I work is in a \u0026ldquo;Research and Technology Park\u0026rdquo; at the north end of the University of Waterloo (here). It\u0026rsquo;s a recent development; it has a handful of new office buildings surrounded by empty fields and untended scrubland. Sometimes I walk to work through this scrub and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing what you see. We have foxes, deer sometimes. The other day a hawk flew across the path ten feet in front of me at knee hight, driving a flock of pigeons into the air. There\u0026rsquo;s sometimes a blue heron in a gravel pond, and a groundhog I see regularly as it watches the construction of a new building from just outside its hole.\nAll this wildlife in the middle of town would vanish, of course, if the R\u0026amp;T park gets more tenants, or if the scrubby landscape is manicured to look more attractive. I would miss it and something valuable would be lost.\nYet of course I\u0026rsquo;m only aware of these gems because I work in the first building to be built in the park. I\u0026rsquo;d like to think I\u0026rsquo;m a champion of authenticity, but I guess I\u0026rsquo;m just in the vanguard of corruption.\nThe quandary is obvious. There are parts of the world (\u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; parts) that have value because they are different from their blander surroundings. And yet the value of those parts is largely invisible, and so they are vulnerable to the economic forces that would brush them aside. Preserving these authentic parts of the world requires that we know about them, and that requires someone from the outside to go in and tell us about them.

Charles Teague has put together some great graphs describing the state of the AppStore here.\nWhat Craig H sees is this:\ndevelopers are lowering prices to the lowest possible level in order to get favorable placement in iTunes. This proliferation of 99¢ “ringtone apps” is affecting our product development.\nand here is how:\nRaising your price to help cover \u0026hellip; costs makes it hard to get to the top of the charts. (You’re competing against a lot of other titles in the lower price tier.) You also have to come to terms with the fact that you’re only going to be featured for a short time, so you have to make the bulk of your revenue during this period.\nThis is why we’re going for simple and cheap instead of complex and expensive. Not our preferred choice, but the one that’s fiscally responsible.\nThe root cause of the low price is a classic market for lemons. Here is Craig H again:\nI’ve been thinking about what’s causing this rush to the 99¢ price point. From what I can tell, it’s because people are buying our products sight unseen. I see customers complaining about how “expensive” a $4.99 app is and that it should cost less. (Do they do the same thing when they walk into Starbucks?) The only justification I can find for these attitudes is that you only have a screenshot to evaluate the quality of a product. A buck is easy to waste on an app that looks great in iTunes but works poorly once you install it.\nOur products are a joy to use: as you well know, customers are willing to pay a premium for a quality products. This quality comes at a cost—which we’re willing to incur. The issue is then getting people to see that our $2.99 product really is worth three times the price of a 99¢ piece of crapware.\nThis is, of course, the dilemma of the Internet. Publication is easy, even when Apple maintains the right to take your app off their store. This does not mean everyone benefits from the audience that \u0026ldquo;being published\u0026rdquo; used to bring with it. It just means that the roadblock to finding an audience is shifted further down the road - getting attention for your product. And asymmetric information is a major barrier in your way. How do you distinguish your shiny needle from the haystack in which it sits?\nSo where, he asks, are complex, high quality applications for the iPhone going to come from?\nI can think of two ways forward for mobile apps in the absence of people being prepared to pay actual money.\nOne is that open source community-built applications will come along. But that\u0026rsquo;s less likely on a brand new platform than it is on existing platforms where a broad agreement can be reached on what an application needs to do.\nA second is that the successful applications (beyond Koi Pond) will be entry-points to some valuable service hosted elsewhere, for which someone can charge a subscription price. I\u0026rsquo;d bet on this second one. But applications for their own sake on mobile devices, it seems, will not be going far.\n","date":1229022654,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4e155c986bf843b715324be3047a9655","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/apples-market-for-lemons/","publishdate":"2008-12-11T19:10:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/apples-market-for-lemons/","section":"post","summary":"iPhone application developer Craig Hockenberry writes an open letter to Steve Jobs here, featured in Fortune magazine here, pointing out very reasonably that the 10,000 iPhone applications are experiencing a race to the bottom in terms of price.

Netflix claims that 60% of its rentals are driven by its Cinematch recommender system [link]; that\u0026rsquo;s over half a billion dollars of business in 2008. As online commerce continues to grow, recommender systems will only get more important.\nII\nRecommender systems are culturally important too. As more of our culture moves online, they will be responsible for more of our cultural experiences, and will play an important role in shaping the creative parts of our societies.\nIII\nRecommender systems will get better. Ten years ago they were largely improvised. Now you can do a Ph.D. in recommender systems and there are international academic conferences all about them [link]. The subject is ideal for academics - it is algorithmic and yet open ended, with many different approaches and criteria for success. It\u0026rsquo;s an endless playground for exploration and simulation.\nIV\nEven though they will improve, there is no such thing as an optimal recommender system. Accuracy is insufficient. The interests of recommendees vary. Serendipity, intra-list variety, reliability and trust-generation are just a few other considerations [pdf link].\nV\nDon\u0026rsquo;t confuse the outcome of recommender systems with intrinsic merit. The recommendations are highly dependent on history and are the products of cumulative advantage. Many think that \u0026ldquo;if the experts could only figure out what it was about, say, the music, songwriting and packaging of Norah Jones that appealed to so many fans, they ought to be able to replicate it at will\u0026rdquo;. But hits cannot be reliably predicted because our choices and preferences are too inter-linked. Clive Thompson writes that companies with recommender systems can \u0026ldquo;track everything their customers do. Every page you visit, every purchase you make, every item you rate — it is all recorded.\u0026rdquo; [link] But other studies have shown the systems to be chaotic. Tiny, random fluctuations can lead to completely different outcomes. [link]\n**VI **\nRecommender systems can easily reinforce inequalities among recommended items. A system that recommends popular items will increase those items\u0026rsquo; popularity. Unpopular items will be left in the dust. Such systems can make big hits even bigger, and can lead to an overall decrease in cultural diversity.\n**VII **\nRecommender systems can increase the experience of diversity. By drawing attention to items individuals have not found by themselves, they can lead to new experiences. But individual diversity is different from overall diversity. Some systems can increase both individual and overall diversity. Other systems increase individual diversity but, at the same time, prompt consumers to be increasingly similar to each other. Their selections then come from an increasingly narrow range of items [pdf link].\nVIII\nOwnership matters. Given the variety of approaches, outcomes, and absence of clear \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; alternatives, and given the ability of recommender systems to shape the experiences of their users, there is ample room for ulterior motives to become embodied in the system. The incentives for the recommender and the recommendee may be different. The incentives for Netflix in a regime where they deliver physical DVDs (of which they have limited stock) may be to promote the back catalogue. When they deliver movies digitally (as they are about to) there may be no such constraint and they may be more tempted to promote existing blockbusters. The most valuable recommender systems may be those that are independent of producers and vendors.\n**IX **\nTransparency matters. The unmarked presence of sponsored items in a recommendation list would be widely viewed as a corrupt set of recommendations, but just as some bookstores charge for premium display sites within the store, so sites on recommendation lists may be sold. Recommendees have a right to know if payola is part of the system.\nX\nRecommender systems will displace the filtering role of both reviewers and of publishers. But while bad reviewers and publishers would not be missed, good reviewers and publishers are not only filters; they are also an active part of cultural creation. The impact of recommender systems on these members of creative communities is important.\nXI\nThe word \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; is widely used in conjunction with recommender systems, but they do little to build communities. Their use is essentially an individual, isolated act. Groups and networks are as important in the creation and experience of culture as individuals. Recommender systems will play a role in how culture is experienced, but they are not necessarily a strong force pushing us either towards or away from a healthy culture.\nXII\nRecommender systems only filter culture, in various ways; the point is to create environments in which artists can prosper.\n","date":1227485312,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"034559ea75b567e81e10f52856eba6ad","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/theses-on-netflix/","publishdate":"2008-11-24T00:08:32Z","relpermalink":"/post/theses-on-netflix/","section":"post","summary":"Pretentious enough title for you?\nI\nRecommender systems - those algorithms that guess what you may be interested in as you browse Amazon or listen to last.fm - are commercially important.

So I\u0026rsquo;ll call them by their initials: NC (C for Carr and Cloud) and TO (for Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly and Two point O).\nTo bring you up to date:\n TO claims NC interpreted \u0026ldquo;network effects\u0026rdquo; too narrowly (\u0026ldquo;Nick only sees first order network effects\u0026rdquo;) while NC claims TO interpreted \u0026ldquo;network effects\u0026rdquo; too broadly (\u0026ldquo;today O\u0026rsquo;Reilly is expanding his definition of \u0026lsquo;network effect\u0026rsquo; far beyond his original definition\u0026rdquo;).\n Meanwhile NC claims that TO interpreted \u0026ldquo;cloud computing\u0026rdquo; too narrowly (\u0026ldquo;O\u0026rsquo;Reilly is here using \u0026lsquo;cloud computing\u0026rsquo; in the narrow sense\u0026hellip;\u0026lsquo;) while TO claims NC interpreted \u0026ldquo;cloud computing\u0026rdquo; too broadly (well, I can\u0026rsquo;t find a sentence to back that up, but it\u0026rsquo;s just too symmetrical to leave out).\n  TO actually has a point, and I agree with him that NC is overly-narrow. There are many kinds of indirect network effects that still qualify for the name. For example, here I am referencing only TO and NC while others have also contributed to the debate. And I suspect that TO and NC have taken this issue up because their opponent is an A-list blogger and so a dispute gives the issue a prominence it would otherwise not have. So both TO and NC are gaining readers because they already have a lot of existing readers. So the world turns.\nBut on the big issue, I still side with NC. Here\u0026rsquo;s why.\nTO defines the original issue as this claim, written by Hugh Macleod: \u0026ldquo;Nobody\u0026rsquo;s saying that one day a single company may possibly emerge to dominate The Cloud, the way Google came to dominate Search, the way Microsoft came to dominate Software.\u0026rdquo; But then TO later redefines the question as whether the cloud infrastructure business is likely to be a low-margin business based on selling commodities. Given NC\u0026rsquo;s question \u0026ldquo;will the infrastructure suppliers also come to dominate the supply of apps?\u0026rdquo; the dispute is actually about not one question, but a set of distinct questions:\n Is infrastructure cloud computing a low-margin business?\n Is infrastructure cloud computing a commodity business?\n Is infrastructure cloud computing a natural monopoly?\n Do profits lie solely at the top layer of the cloud (applications/APIs)?\n Are the synergies among layers of the cloud enough that success in one area translates into success in other areas?\n  You see, this is why I\u0026rsquo;m no top blogger. Each of these is a complicated question, and I\u0026rsquo;m not qualified to answer any of them. It\u0026rsquo;s not even clear to me which of these questions are separate. This is why I don\u0026rsquo;t trust big ideas or catchy names and why I\u0026rsquo;ll never write a best-selling business book (well, one reason. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are many more). But in pursuit of some light rather than heat I\u0026rsquo;ll try to draw some lines.\nMost importantly, the first three of these questions are obviously related, but TO combines them and confusion results. A typical commodity business (selling widgets that are the same as the next guy\u0026rsquo;s widgets) is low margin because a commodity business is characterised by decreasing returns and so by low barriers to entry and intense price competition. But you can be in the business of selling commodities and yet still profit from increasing returns. Amazon is a prime example. Books are commodities (anyone can sell a book), and this limits Amazon\u0026rsquo;s margin per book to being small. But online bookstores are not commodities - they are characterised by huge fixed costs (the Amazon computing infrastructure) and there are massive barriers to entry in the online bookselling business. So Amazon is a low-margin seller of commodities but is also a near-monopoly. Wal-Mart is another example in the physical world - it\u0026rsquo;s obviously in a low margin business (really low) but it has used economies of scale to build a large market share in the US. Telcos and utility companies are others where the forces towards a natural monopoly are strong enough to have attracted antitrust action while still being low-margin. Few would dispute the fact that Amazon and Wal-Mart are both immensely powerful companies. The argument that \u0026ldquo;infrastructure cloud computing is a commodity business, therefore no single company will dominate that layer of the cloud\u0026rdquo; is simply false.\nIs infrastructure cloud computing a natural monopoly? There are many forces (network effects and others) pushing it in that direction, but there are others (the variety of services demanded in particular) that pull it away from a natural monopoly. I suspect this market will be oligopolistic rather than monopolistic - that there will be enough fragmentation in the kinds of offering available that a demand for variety will make it more like the automobile industry than like the online bookstore industry.\nDo profits lie solely at the top layer of the cloud? Again, no. You can be low-margin and high profit as long as the scale is big enough (see Amazon and Wal-Mart, above).\nAnd finally, are synergies enough that a single company (Google being the obvious one) may come to dominate all layers of the cloud? That\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a question. If there is any company that could do so it would be Google. And if it does then I hope the antitrust people are all over it. But sources of variety are surprising - many people thought that the age of TV would mean local accents would die out, but of course they are still strong in many places - and I am hopeful that there are enough such sources to prevent the web collapsing into a Google-shaped black hole.\n","date":1225144470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"aa6199da7614b4e7bff9cd6fa7181fe9","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/cloudy-monopolies-ii/","publishdate":"2008-10-27T21:54:30Z","relpermalink":"/post/cloudy-monopolies-ii/","section":"post","summary":"After yesterday\u0026rsquo;s bout, Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly responds to Nicholas Carr and Nicholas Carr responds to Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly\u0026rsquo;s response.

The forces that shape the grocery store industry are different from those that shape the automobile industry, home furnishing stores, copper mining, the insurance industry, and so on.\nIn contrast, there is a tendency to think as if all digital industries are governed by the same set of factors. We talk about iTunes as if it has something to say about the success of SalesForce.com; about Netflix as if it has something to do with the success of Google. The runaway success of companies like Facebook and Amazon, which provide services that get more valuable the more people use them, has led to a focus on network effects as the driving force behind industry concentration. But it\u0026rsquo;s obviously true on the Internet just as it\u0026rsquo;s true elsewhere that selling books is different from selling advertising.\nI say all this because A-list technopundits Tim O\u0026rsquo;Reilly and Nicholas Carr have competing posts about industry concentration in the world of cloud computing. And while I lean towards Carr, each oversimplifies the issues.\nO\u0026rsquo;Reilly coined the phrase Web 2.0 and he says the cloud is, not surprisingly, all about Web 2.0. \u0026ldquo;Understanding the dynamics of increasing returns on the web is the essence of what I called Web 2.0. Ultimately, on the network, applications win if they get better the more people use them.\u0026rdquo; That is, there is one source of increasing returns you need to think about when considering industry concentration on the Internet, and that\u0026rsquo;s network effects. On the other hand, he recognizes that \u0026ldquo;cloud computing\u0026rdquo; is a name that covers several different developments, including hosted virtualized computers (Amazon\u0026rsquo;s EC2 and S3), hosted software platforms (Salesforce.com and Google Apps) and cloud-based applications (Facebook, Flickr). He claims that real industry concentration (and hence profits) will take place only in the third of these layers, because only here do network effects really come into play.\nCarr\u0026rsquo;s recent book The Big Switch caught the wave of cloud computing, and so he says that the cloud is more important than mere Web 2.0. He points out that there are many sources of increasing returns in addition to network effects. Using Google as an example, he points to (not by name) learning-by-doing (Google gets better at search algorithms because they learn from their own experience); high fixed costs (the need for massive data centres); and asymmetric information (the predictability of a brand-name experience). But Carr does not distinguish different aspects of cloud computing.\nI think Carr is closer to being right. There are so many sources of increasing returns in digital industries, in addition to the big one that the marginal cost of production of a digital good is basically zero, that the normal expected state of Internet industries is surely monopoly, give or take.\nBut guess what? Not all Internet industries are monopolies and if we are to get to grips with industry concentration in Internet-driven industries we need to acknowledge that different digital industries are pushed by different forces. Different parts of the cloud computing world really are different and will see different levels of concentration.\nWhat we need to do is not so much look at the sources of increasing returns to scale, which are many, but instead look for what factors might limit increasing returns and prevent the expected monopolies from forming. Any such factor will affect different digital industries in different ways. I\u0026rsquo;ll just look at one factor to show what I mean.\nJust to be au courant, let\u0026rsquo;s look at Paul Krugman\u0026rsquo;s Nobel prize winning work (see a PDF here) as a source of inspiration. We have, collectively and individually, a preference for variety (and, loosely speaking, a variety of preferences) and this preference limits industry concentration. Here\u0026rsquo;s how. According to the classical model of trade, industries should get very concentrated as each country focuses on its own area of comparative advantage. If Germany is good at making cars and Sweden is good at making bookcases then all the cars will be made in Germany and all the bookcases in Sweden - then they will trade cars for bookcases.\nBut in the real world both cars and bookcases are made in both Sweden and Germany and they each trade both cars and bookcases among themselves. Industry concentration is limited. How come?\nOne of the things Krugman used to explain this observation is the idea that as consumers we have a taste for variety. So MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s may have economies of scale and sell a lot of burgers, but no one wants to eat MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s all the time so there\u0026rsquo;s a limit to how much of the restaurant industry MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s can win over. There are many sources of heterogeneous tastes. Geography is an obvious one - I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in a bookstore in Saskatoon because I\u0026rsquo;ve no way of getting there. Culture is another - I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in Russian-language books. And when it comes to music and clothes, well there\u0026rsquo;s no accounting for taste. But wherever there is a taste for variety, industry concentration will be limited.\nIt will be interesting to see what kinds of variety create barriers to concentration in the cloud. On the hardware/virtual machine realm I can imagine security and service level agreements providing distinguishing factors that may encourage variety. Is it worth a hosting company going through endless certifications to get validated as a secure-host for private data? Will they bet the bank on high service levels? At the Web 2.0 applications level, it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that culture provides a surprisingly strong barrier for some experiences. As just one physical world example, the record of giant grocery stores outside their own country is surprisingly patchy. Wal-Mart, Tesco and Carrefoure each hold sway in their own country but haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to be successful in the others\u0026rsquo;. When I signed up to Facebook the obvio us Americanness of the site was a turn off (which college did I go to? a politics spectrum from \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;very liberal\u0026rdquo;?). Perhaps this is why different countries have different major social networking sites.\nBut my fear is that a taste for variety may not be strong enough to hold back very large concentration at many levels. You might think that people searching for different kinds of information may use different search engines. In Canada when I search for NDP I want to find the New Democratic Party, but an Irish searcher may be looking for the National Development Plan. But so far Google has been able to use its sources of increasing returns to scale to accommodate this variety and more, without letting competitors in. There are basically no niche search engines.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the same in online encyclopedias; in the real world the physical limits of books mean that there are all kinds of specialist interests that Encyclopedia Britannica cannot cater to, and so we have encyclopedias of film, of football, of frogs, and so on. In the online world there\u0026rsquo;s only one encyclopedia and it covers all these areas.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s why I am inclined to agree with Carr.\n","date":1225058742,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"2ee1ba7259a34507197fffcb72073bb6","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/oreilly-vs-carr-on-cloudy-monopolies/","publishdate":"2008-10-26T22:05:42Z","relpermalink":"/post/oreilly-vs-carr-on-cloudy-monopolies/","section":"post","summary":"In the offline world it is obvious that industries have different levels of concentration.

Here is some of it:\n[T]alking about \"free riding\" as a problem the Wikipedia community needs to solve doesn't make any sense. The overwhelming majority of Wikipedia users \"free ride,\" and far from being a drag on Wikipedia's growth, this large audience acts as a powerful _motivator_ for continued contribution to the site. People like to contribute to an encyclopedia with a large readership; indeed, the enormous number of \"free-riders\"—a.k.a. users—is one of the most appealing things about being a Wikipedia editor.   This is more than a semantic point. Unfortunately, the \"free riding\" frame is one of the most common ways people discuss the economics of online content creation, and I think it has been an obstacle to clear thinking.    The idea of \"free riding\" is based on a couple of key 20th-century assumptions that just don't apply to the online world. The first assumption is that the production of content is a net cost that must either be borne by the producer or compensated by consumers. This is obviously true for _some_ categories of content—no one has yet figured out how to peer-produce Hollywood-quality motion pictures, for example—but it's far from universal. Moreover, the real world abounds in counterexamples. No one loses sleep over the fact that people \"free ride\" off of watching company softball games, community orchestras, or amateur poetry readings. To the contrary, it's understood that the vast majority of musicians, poets, and athletes find these activities intrinsically enjoyable, and they're _grateful_ to have an audience \"free ride\" off of their effort.   The same principle applies to Wikipedia. Participating in Wikipedia is a net positive experience for both readers _and_ editors. We don't need to \"solve\" the free rider problem because there are more than enough people out there for whom the act of contributing is its own reward.    You can see how we got into this problem. Britannica is an encyclopedia and it is an economic enterprise. Wikipedia ends in pedia so it must be an economic enterprise too. But it is not, and we should look elsewhere for our analogies. Once we stop thinking of Wikipedia in economic terms the supposed paradox disappears. Small wonder that, as Lee says, economists are the ones who have the hardest time understanding it.\nAmateurs have performed on other world-stages before now. Sports provides prominent examples: rugby union,Wimbledon and the Olympics were all amateur-only for many years. What happened, of course, is that although these stages were not economic for their participants, the hosts ended up with a lot of money once the world of television and advertising intruded. And once the hosts got money the performers started acting like economic agents too and demanded their share. Giving an amateur performance on a non-profit stage is not a paradox, but giving an amateur performance on a profitable stage is being a sucker.\nWikipedia, for historical reasons, has so far kept advertising and profit out of the picture. But other \u0026ldquo;platforms of mass collaboration\u0026rdquo; have not - Amazon, YouTube, IMDB, Bebo have all shown that the owners of the stage can make a lot of money. And once they do, it\u0026rsquo;s only so long before the actors start to demand a share, and the whole dynamic changes.\nThe indiscriminate gushing over the age of mass collaboration has obscured these differences for now, but they won\u0026rsquo;t for long. And then, I would guess, amateur production may go the way of the amateur olympics. But maybe not - let\u0026rsquo;s hope that non-profit stages stay that way so that the economists\u0026rsquo; misunderstanding of Wikipedia can continue.\n","date":1224855744,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"a0accdb20f5d6373f52cf80bcb95cdb6","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/all-the-webs-a-stage/","publishdate":"2008-10-24T13:42:24Z","relpermalink":"/post/all-the-webs-a-stage/","section":"post","summary":"Timothy Lee has an excellent post at Freedom To Tinker.

But it\u0026rsquo;s no longer either/or. A few recent milestones highlight how YouTube is changing.\nFirst, Avril Lavigne pipped a homegrown video to be first to 100 million viewers and now \u0026ldquo;six of the 10 most-watched videos of all time are straight music videos.\u0026rdquo;\nSecond, CBS has reached an agreement with Google to show full-length TV shows on YouTube.\nThird, Tina Fey\u0026rsquo;s Sarah Palin sketches for Saturday Night Live have been watched more times on the Internet than on TV. Says the Associated Press:\nThere were 10.2 million people watching the season-opening \"Saturday Night Live\" when Fey first appeared as Palin, with Amy Poehler portraying Hillary Clinton, according to Nielsen Media Research. These days, that's a good-sized audience for prime-time, let alone late-night, TV. Another 1.2 million people captured the episode on their DVRs and watched within the week. Through the middle of last week, NBC estimated that it had streamed the skit online more than 13 million times. Those are just the numbers NBC can keep track of; the skit was undoubtedly captured and posted or e-mailed many more times. NBC perfected \"widget\" technology only a few months ago, allowing video of its material to be captured across the Internet while retaining a tie to the network's Web site. It has aggressively marketed the Fey skits to political and comedy blogs... ...There's also the chance for even more revenue. Only in the past few weeks has NBC Universal perfected the technology to place a movie studio advertisement at the end of the clip it distributes online. Pre-clip advertising would add even more value.    It\u0026rsquo;s not actually YouTube - as the article says, NBC now posts its own videos and removes them from the YouTube site when viewers post there - but these developments show that Internet viewing can be complementary to, not competitive with, mainstreamTV. And \u0026ldquo;going viral\u0026rdquo; is no longer reserved for amateur guitar players. In fact, in an example of the centripetal web, the Internet now lets US Network productions go where they could not go before - you can now watch Fey/Palin in the UK on the Guardian and The BBC web sites.\nWhether TV networks will end up hosting their own material a la NBC, or whether there will be more CBS-style Google/network deals that see the networks outsourcing the hosting to YouTube in return for a slice of the advertising money, who knows? But the trend is clear; the confrontation between Internet and TV is coming to an end. The old enemies were perhaps never really at each others throats, and now they will cohabit happily. And while YouTube will continue to host amateur videos (why not?) it will make money from the music videos and the TV networks as it moves to higher-quality images and longer shows. Google\u0026rsquo;s expanded YouTube advertising initiatives will help these deals along.\nThe Carr-Benkler wager is looking more and more like a win for Carr.\n","date":1224467050,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"7a16b49f5f5a0d95ef9736e80c8525c6","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/youtube-becomes-big-business/","publishdate":"2008-10-20T01:44:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/youtube-becomes-big-business/","section":"post","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s one of those hoary old sayings - it\u0026rsquo;s been around for maybe two whole years now - that while the Geezer Generation of passive consumers watched network TV, the Net Generation of cool participators go on YouTube and do their creative teenage thing.

Because although he loses this battle (if asked I will bore people with the details, but I really don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a point), sloppy business journalism has won the war.\nFace it. Chris Anderson now has people at Harvard Business School of all places spending their valuable time following up his idle speculations. He comes up with a half-baked idea, has basically no data to support it, and yet here are academics - smart people, with tenure, real jobs and things to do - actually spending their time following up these idle daydreams; acting as his research assistants.

Here are other people - like Princeton University\u0026rsquo;s Ed Felten, Drew Conway from New York University, Fernando Pereira from the University of Pennsylvania and John Timmer who teaches at Cornell - smart people who work in universities, and probably with families and friends who could use their attention - who feel they have to spend their time explaining a few of the reasons why he is wrong in his latest screed.

It\u0026rsquo;s going to be great. And here\u0026rsquo;s the best thing of all: you can help me write it!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s about the Internet and how it\u0026rsquo;s changing the world. I\u0026rsquo;ve got the outline done and I was just thinking I need a research assistant to fill in the details. Then I thought - well, why just one? There are a million research assistants out there - let\u0026rsquo;s crowdsource!\nAny book about the Internet needs a big idea. Not just a kind-of-big idea either, but a Great-Big-Fuck-Off-Massive Idea. The kind of idea that is so big you can\u0026rsquo;t get your head round it, and yet which you can put in a short phrase so you can trademark it. My Idea is that there are now more ideas in the world than ever before. What\u0026rsquo;s more, these ideas are not just stuck inside people\u0026rsquo;s heads doing nothing, but thanks to the Internet everyone is putting their ideas out there for the world to see. And then these ideas spark other ideas. So with more ideas than ever before, and better ways of getting ideas acted on, the future just has to be insanely great.\nWe are living in an explosion of ideas. That\u0026rsquo;s where the title comes from. I thought of calling it \u0026ldquo;A Hundred Flowers\u0026rdquo; because that sounds a bit more classy and intellectual, but then I thought maybe Maoism isn\u0026rsquo;t where I should be going with this one and Explosion!TM is probably more catchy.\nHere is my outline. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I\u0026rsquo;ll post it on a wiki somewhere and all you great people can just work on it right there. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll take it to the publisher and we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes. Hey - you may even get an acknowledgement in a best selling book!\nExplosion!TM\nWhy there are more ideas in the world than ever before and why the future will be amazing\nChapter 1. The Internet is Brilliant\n_- An Inspiring Story\n_I\u0026rsquo;m starting with the true tale of an everyday white teenage boy from a middle-class family in California - a university drop out shunned by classmates and living in a deprived environment except for his state-of-the art computer network and online poker winnings, who toiled for years in obscurity only to suddenly hit it rich thanks to the viral spread of his amazing Idea.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like you to find that story.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much to do with the rest of the book, but it needs to get the reader fired up. The right story will show how in these days of meritocratic digital democracy anyone can become a visionary leader in the radically crazy, wild west world that is the Internet. Pretty cool eh?\n_\n- The Idea. _\nI\u0026rsquo;ve already told you what The Idea is. I got it this afternoon when I was thinking about what to write about for my next book. Where can I get an idea, I thought? Well, I thought, you can get anything you want at Alice\u0026rsquo;s Internet (that\u0026rsquo;s a joke). So I looked on the internet and there are all these ideas out there and I thought - wow, that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of ideas. Probably more than ever before. And that\u0026rsquo;s how The Idea was born.\nChapter 2. The New World Of Ideas\nIf you were an author you would know that after presenting The Idea you have to make it plausible. Not in detail, but just enough to keep the reader moving along. And that\u0026rsquo;s what this chapter is for.\nHave you ever thought about how many ideas there are in the world? No? Well I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you. There are millions and millions. If you google the word \u0026ldquo;idea\u0026rdquo; you get 725 million pages. Now that\u0026rsquo;s what I call a lot of ideas.\nIn the old days ideas only came from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard. I mean, Bertrand Russell was a Lord for Christ\u0026rsquo;s sake. And how many Lords are there? Not many, that\u0026rsquo;s how many. Now there are Internet entrepreneurs in Bulgaria and Ghana? Who knew? Is the Internet fantastic or what?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll finish the chapter with the story of Stelios Haji-Ioannou. You probably haven\u0026rsquo;t heard of him because you are not an author. He is not only disabled, but he comes from Greek Cyprus of all god-forsaken places and yet he started the successful company easyJet when he was only 28. I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about him yet but his story sounds like a great way to wrap up the chapter. Actually he\u0026rsquo;s not disabled, but his name does appear at the top of the list when you google \u0026ldquo;disabled entrepreneur\u0026rdquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s surely close enough.\nChapter 3. The History of Ideas\nAfter that high-speed opening it\u0026rsquo;s time to go all academic and reflective. You\u0026rsquo;d know that if you were an author. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about all those greek guys (not Stelios; the old ones like Plato and Socrates) Then I\u0026rsquo;ll say - get this - that there were only a few thousand people around who could even read back then never mind think (note to research assistant - get a real number for this will you? and make it small) and now there are like 6 billion of us. So if you do the arithmetic there are probably about a million Platos alive right now and a million Socrates and on and on. Whew! I bet that makes you think.\nNow you might say \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s impressive, but how can we find these ideas?\u0026rdquo; But thanks to the Internet we can find them because we are all connected. Wow.\nI have to demonstrate my credibility in this chapter so it will take some serious googling to come up with obscure stories about the Greeks. Maybe the thing to do is not talk about Plato and Socrates but someone really obscure like Heraclitus because that sounds way more sophisticated and esoteric. Wikipedia says that \u0026ldquo;he is known for his doctrine of change being central to the universe\u0026rdquo; and if my book isn\u0026rsquo;t about change I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is, so that\u0026rsquo;s a great tie in right there.\nChapter 4. Why the World Was Miserable Before the Internet\nThis chapter is about the 20th century, before the Internet came along.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start in the 1950\u0026rsquo;s. Everyone wore the same clothes and it was like the whole world was filled with creepy borg-like automatons except without the implants. I\u0026rsquo;m going to write the whole chapter in black and white just to emphasize how few bright and colourful ideas there were. I mean, there was just nothing going on.\nThen there was the 1960\u0026rsquo;s, which only had two ideas: peace and love. It was nice and all, but it was pretty simple and naive when we look back at it from our hyper-linked present.\nThe 1970\u0026rsquo;s I think I\u0026rsquo;ll skip over, because fashions were pretty bad and computers weren\u0026rsquo;t really happening yet so I don\u0026rsquo;t think there were many ideas about then. There was punk music and space travel, so that\u0026rsquo;s two, but they were pretty lame really.\nNo one really knows anything about the 1980\u0026rsquo;s any more, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s the key to the whole story. The 1980\u0026rsquo;s were the decade of the personal computer, of the first incarnation of Apple, of chaos theory, and of the growth of Japan which is always good for a few paragraphs.\nThen 1990s is all globalization and stuff, so that\u0026rsquo;ll be OK. And the beginnings of the Internet, so it\u0026rsquo;ll be, like, the big bang that started everything off. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll do a whole bit about the first web page because stories are so much better than boring facts and who knew what that very first page was going to lead to? No one, that\u0026rsquo;s who.\nChapter 5. The Economics of Ideas\nThis is the chapter with some really serious thinking in it. There used to be these things called transaction costs that prevented new ideas getting out there. Thinks like checking the results of research or getting a research paper accepted or finding a publisher for your book, or even doing all those complicated experiments and stuff that took just forever and never really worked out the way they should have done. It was a real pain in the neck is what I hear - it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising there were so few ideas around.\nBut now all those obstacles have gone and anyone can just have an idea and publish it on the Internet and the whole world can see it. It\u0026rsquo;s like there\u0026rsquo;s a Long Tail of ideas and now we can get all those ideas in the tail and put them on the Internet when they used to just go nowhere because of transaction costs.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done some research to look at how many pages you get if you google for \u0026ldquo;idea\u0026rdquo; in the last 24 hours, etc. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I found.\n**Time Period **  **Number of ideas (millions) ** 24 hours  11.9 past week  9.9 past month  19.7 past 2 months  28 past 3 months  31.4 past 6 months  40.6 past year  51.6 any time  725  That means over 1% of all ideas ever have been had in the last 24 hours! I mean, I know Google exaggerates the number of recent events and I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to say that you can\u0026rsquo;t really treat this as rigorous but that\u0026rsquo;s still pretty amazing. Someone should do a Ph.D. on that - there\u0026rsquo;s an idea for you, for free.\nChapter 6. With Enough Eyeballs, All Ideas Are Shallow\nMost people think ideas need a lot of thinking to come up with, and now we can\u0026rsquo;t even read a short story without getting bored, so where are these ideas coming from? Actually there\u0026rsquo;s a simple answer - open source.\nA big idea is really just a whole lot of little ideas stuck together.\nIt used to be that one person had to sit down in a garret or something and think of all these little ideas and string them together until they got a big idea. Now they just put their little ideas on the Internet and then other people see them and add their own bits and before you know where you are all those individual bits have added up to give a big idea, without anyone having to work hard at all!\nI\u0026rsquo;ll talk about how many people contribute to Wikipedia and how Facebook was a great idea so that people could talk to each other without talking and how Google just collects all those great ideas and makes them available for free.\nChapter 7 and 8 and 9. The Next Big Idea\nIn a book with a Big Idea this is the tough part. A single idea is pretty tough to stretch into a whole book, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful somewhere after the half way point there\u0026rsquo;s just not a lot left to say. I think the thing here is to get a whole bunch of ideas that are out there right now and put them in these chapters and see which ones take off. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll do Chapter 6 on culture, Chapter 7 on science, and Chapter 8 on social networking. Should be fun. What ideas can you find?\nChapter 10. The Idea Singularity is Here\nA book called _Explosion_! has just got to finish with a bang.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my big finish. Some ideas die out once they have been thought of. Like the bicycle: once someone had thought of the bicycle, nothing much else happened to it for a long time. At least I guess it didn\u0026rsquo;t, and who would know if it did? But some ideas are a launchpad for other new ideas. Like when Newton had the idea of gravity - it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all over and done with, he started off a whole new set of ideas.\nIf every idea can get picked up by other people then that means ideas spread like a virus. An idea infects other people as it goes through society. So with more connections between people (like the Internet) more ideas get picked up and fewer ideas die out. I think we\u0026rsquo;re about to reach a tipping point where each idea will give rise to more than one idea. And that means the number of ideas is just going to go crazy. I mean, you think we have a lot of ideas now - just you wait. Give it a few years and this world is going to be Idea Planet. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be fucking great.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the book.

They give this development progressive political overtones by labelling it \u0026ldquo;the \u0026lsquo;amateur collaborative content\u0026rsquo; movement\u0026rdquo; [p216] and explicitly identify it as a non-commercial alternative to the market. I don\u0026rsquo;t know Dan Hunter\u0026rsquo;s other writings but Quiggin, at least, is a social democrat whose views I usually agree with and whose writings I read often and respect, so I don\u0026rsquo;t disagree lightly with him. But the picture they paint is a distorted one so I have to.\n[Note to regular readers: you may want to move right along - much of what\u0026rsquo;s here is stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve written earlier in other contexts. It\u0026rsquo;s just more of the same, but it needs to be said.]\nThere are three major things wrong with the paper.\n A portion of the activity they describe as non-commercial is in fact commercial.\n They exaggerate the rise of the amateur in the Internet age.\n They neglect the other side of the coin, which is the spread of commercialism into areas that were previously non-commercial.\n  I thought I\u0026rsquo;d talk about all three, but it\u0026rsquo;s taking too long to write and I need to go and cook some dinner as part of my contribution to our household\u0026rsquo;s creative production so I\u0026rsquo;ll just address the first. If I were to say something about the other two it would be\n(2) in assessing the rise of the new amateurism they neglect instances of amateur production that existed before the Internet and may be driven out by the rise of the Internet. And\n(3) Facebook represents the commercialization of conversation, not the amateurization of collaborative content production.\nThe distinguishing technological feature of the collaborative web (\u0026ldquo;web 2.0\u0026rdquo;) is the shift from peer-to-peer networks to a \u0026ldquo;platform\u0026rdquo; architecture that is built on top of the lower-level protocols of the Internet.\nWikipedia is a platform: it defines the ways in which you can interact with it, stores the changes you make, and provides security and authentication mechanisms among other things. Facebook is a platform. Amazon is a platform. YouTube is a platform. Blogging takes place on platforms. So the authors are wrong when they say that \u0026ldquo;As a result of various forces—notably the ascension of the general purpose computer, peer-to-peer technologies, and the internet—all manner of established verities in the content industry are falling.\u0026rdquo; [p215] None of the platforms mentioned above operate in a peer-to-peer manner.\nThe distinction matters because when content is built on a platform, it is in some important senses owned by the platform-owner or aggregator. Private ownership is present, even if the content (videos, book reviews etc) is explicitly shared by its amateur producer. The suggestion that \u0026ldquo;Users can modify open source software as they see fit, and can choose whether to make their modifications publicly available, but cannot charge for the use of software derived from an open source program.\u0026rdquo; [218] is incorrect for open source software itself (it applies only to GPL\u0026rsquo;d software and not software produced under other open source licenses such as the BSD license, and even then copyright owners - such as MySQL AB, now a part of Sun Microsystems - can and do charge for some versions of the software). More importantly for this paper, it is also misleading when it comes to collaborative content. Chad and Steve cannot sell an individual video produced by an amateur, but they can sell the entire collection of videos lock stock and barrel to Google for about a third of a billion dollars each; Michael Birch can sell Bebo and all its content (including Billy Bragg\u0026rsquo;s songs) to AOL and pocket $600 million. Now that\u0026rsquo;s commercial. Or you can get a seat at Davos, of course, which now seems to be the Cannes red carpet equivalent for our youthful webby leaders.\nAmateur production on a non-commercial platform such as Wikipedia is non-commercial. And it\u0026rsquo;s important. No argument there. But amateur production on a commercial platform is commercial activity. With one party in each transaction motivated my money, it\u0026rsquo;s the sound of one hand shaking. Back in 2003 Tim Bray\u0026rsquo;s dinner companion Robb Beal introduced the phrase \u0026ldquo;digital sharecropping\u0026rdquo; to distinguished building software \u0026ldquo;for any platform that is owned and operated by a company\u0026rdquo; from building sofware for the web. But now that dichotomy has faded: the web includes many platforms owned and operated by companies and sharecropping has moved online along with it. Nicholas Carr has been particularly pointed about the movement of digital sharecropping onto the web, and Seth Finkelstein has pointed to several examples including citizen journalism. It\u0026rsquo;s a phrase that should be front and centre of everyone\u0026rsquo;s mind when they see the phrase \u0026ldquo;networked production\u0026rdquo;.\nThe distinction can often be seen in who is sharing what. On a non-commercial platform, the amateurs share and the platform owners share as well. At least, my understanding is that on Wikipedia not only the content but also the software and large amounts of data mining derived from it about users and so on is shared publicly. In contrast, on a commercial platform only the amateur material is shared. The contributions of the commercial part of the transaction (Amazon\u0026rsquo;s sales data for example; data on user habits; the software that runs the platform itself) are not shared \u0026ndash; in fact this half of the story is hidden with as much zealousness as the source code of any closed-source company. One of the reasons that \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail\u0026rdquo; was such a flop of a book is that the data Chris Anderson relies on is unavailable for anyone else to inspect, and much of it was given to him in filtered form by the content owners.\nA second failure is most obviously present in the following paragraph (page 245).\nCopyright thus provides incentives to the intermediaries of the content industries—publishers, agents, movie studios, retail stores, etc.— where the processes of moving content from creator to user are expensive or capital-intensive. These “content processes” include the creation of the content, the selection of the content for commercial publication, its production and dissemination, its marketing, and its eventual use. Until recently each of these processes has been too expensive, too difficult, or too specialized for amateurs to undertake. So until now, highly capitalized intermediaries were necessary to ensure that content moved into society.    Amazon, Google and so on are obviously highly capitalized. More so, in fact, than many small distributors of pre-web content. The web is seeing the movement of content into society consolidated into a handful of \u0026ldquo;highly capitalized intermediaries\u0026rdquo;: very large and wealthy commerically-driven web site owners, including such old-school outfits as News Corporation, the owner of MySpace. It does no good to ignore this trend.\nThe paper also elides the distinction between amateur and professional motivations, with the temptation to caricature employed work as factory-line production of alienated labour, while amateur work is driven by love. To take a relevant example, what is the overlap between the motivations of John Quiggin (blogger) and John Quiggin (employee)? Is his work for the University of Queensland driven by the his \u0026ldquo;first rule\u0026rdquo; which is \u0026ldquo;never to give more than you get?\u0026rdquo; [231] And if not, why does he think that software engineers for commercial software companies writing closed-source programs are driven by different motivations? There is a possible argument (nicely made by Geof in a comment on a previous post) about alienation and the relationship between the developer and the code, but this does not cover production in sharecropping platforms. I\u0026rsquo;m more inclined to go with another comment by Dipper, that participation in many cases can be covered by standard utilitarian calculus.\nOne argument made by the authors is that the incorporation of money into production would drive out amateur efforts in a blood-donation kind of way. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to help push someone\u0026rsquo;s car out from a snow drift for free, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it for a dollar. But there are two groups of people with an incentive to keep money out of the equation: one is the promoters of real community-driven, shared production (the authors\u0026rsquo; camp, and one I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with) and the other is the turbocapitalist platform owners such as Amazon (would you review a book for a nickel? would you trust the review of someone who did?) It is this shared interest in supressing the role of money for very different reasons that makes me most queasy in contemplating the future of the Internet. We need to be clear in distinguishing public goods from privately owned plantations. Unfortunately, in this paper, John Quiggin and Dan Hunter fail to make the distinction and the result is a distorted picture of web-based creative work. Money may ruin everything, but turning a blind eye to money doesn\u0026rsquo;t get around that problem.\nI feel like I\u0026rsquo;m being harsh on the authors here - as I say, I agree with their political sympathies, and the one I have read (Quiggin) is obviously smart and well informed on many issues. But serious social scientists need to do serious work on the nature of production on the Internet and not just adopt the turbocapitalist line. Me, all I can do is raise a few questions. But then, when it comes to social science, I\u0026rsquo;m just an amateur.\n","date":1211123915,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5ef2e5cc2c945dfef2eeefac914131c3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/money-ruins-eve/","publishdate":"2008-05-18T15:18:35Z","relpermalink":"/post/money-ruins-eve/","section":"post","summary":"In Money Ruins Everything (blog post, complete article), John Quiggin and Dan Hunter look out at the new forms of creative expression introduced by the Internet (blogs, wikis, citizen journalism, and to some extent open-source software) and conclude that today\u0026rsquo;s most important innovations are driven by the collaboration of amateurs with non-economic motives.

In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve only heard stories to the contrary\u0026rdquo; (Searls).\nThe professionalization of Linux matters because it marks a change. Open source now is not the same as ten years ago when The Cathedral and the Bazaar was written.\nDespite the historical revisionism of the \u0026ldquo;paycheck\u0026rsquo;s don\u0026rsquo;t matter\u0026rdquo; crowd, the absence of paychecks certainly mattered ten years ago. Eric Raymond opened his classic essay with these sentences:\n\" Linux is subversive. Who would have thought even five years ago that a world-class operating system could coalesce as if by magic out of part-time hacking by several thousand developers scattered all over the planet, connected only by the tenuous strands of the Internet?\"    Ten years on what stands up? \u0026ldquo;several thousand developers scattered all over the planet\u0026rdquo; does - the number of participants in the Linux kernel is larger than ever. But the Linux kernel now is not developed by \u0026ldquo;part-time hacking\u0026rdquo;. And Linux is no longer subversive, in that anything IBM is happy about is not, by definition, subversive.\nAnd it mattered six years ago when Yochai Benkler wrote \u0026ldquo;Coase\u0026rsquo;s Penguin: Linux and the Nature of the Firm\u0026rdquo;, which contains this statement:\nProgrammers do not generally participate in a project because someone who is their boss instructed them, though some do. They do not generally participate in a project because someone offers them a price, though some participants do focus on long-term appropriation through money-oriented activities, like consulting or service contracts.    So now programmers do participate in the Linux kernel because their boss instructed them to (or paid them to).\nNow I can imagine people saying that just because the Linux programmers are paid, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make their motivation financial and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean companies can tell them what to do. Here is Lee:\nWhat makes the open source model unique isn't who (if anyone) signs the contributors' paychecks. Rather, what matters is the way open source projects are organized internally. In a traditional software project, there's a project manager who decides what features the product will have and allocates employees to work on various features.    This is a caricature. I work in a commercial, closed-source software company, and my job is very close to that of a project manager. But what an expert programmer spends his or her time on is always a negotiated thing. Partly it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of skill and expertise (who is best placed to identify algorithms or code-level weaknesses and areas for improvement?), partly it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of \u0026ldquo;what needs to be done\u0026rdquo; and partly it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of innovation. And as Joel Coehoorn says in a comment to Lee\u0026rsquo;s post, \u0026ldquo;there most definitely are project managers for open source projects. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a single successful open source project that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a well-defined road map for features.\u0026rdquo; Open source believers too often portray paid closed-source programmers as wage slaves, and paid open-source programmers as free agents working for love (to scratch an itch) who just happen to collect a paycheque. It\u0026rsquo;s a dichotomy that just doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold up.\nShirky argues that \u0026ldquo;the idea that the minute you pay people to do something, you have the right to manage them\u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s not true\u0026rdquo; but this statement applies to the employees where I work just as much as to IBM employees working on the Linux kernel, and there is nothing about the Linux kernel that gives Redhat programmers a special \u0026ldquo;ignore the boss\u0026rdquo; license. Shirky says that \u0026ldquo;If [a senior manager] announced a strategic change in the kernel they would be laughed out of the room\u0026rdquo; as if senior managers routinely dictate strategic changes in the Windows kernel or database kernels. More senior managers get laughed out of the room than Shirky would believe.\nThis leaves us with ownership. IBM and Redhat do not own and will never own Linux. But Redhat sells Linux, and the ability to sell something is one component of ownership. The distinction is more one of exclusive ownership. And here the Visa analogy I used originally holds up - Visa is now a separate company but it is also a collaborative venture and companies that helped to build it were simultaneously assisting their competitors. Industrial sponsorship of academic research - an activity the pharmaceutical industry relies on - has the same tensions about ownership and organization and direction.\nOpen source, like any new phenomenon, is changing. Our understanding of it has to change too. The Linux Foundation report prompts us to re-examine some of the neat and clean dichotomies that were floated around ten years ago and see if they still hold water. A few do, but many don\u0026rsquo;t.\n","date":1209809075,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5e60cff48492e69f1759e77560526184","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/linux-again/","publishdate":"2008-05-03T10:04:35Z","relpermalink":"/post/linux-again/","section":"post","summary":"**Last week on \u0026lsquo;Linux Goes Corporate\u0026rsquo;: **After Nick Carr mentioned my post on the Linux Foundation report and on Linux as corporate joint venture, Timothy Lee and Ed Cone/Clay Shirky responded and then Doc Searls put in his two cents worth.

But it is now 17 years old and it has grown up, and a recent report by the Linux Foundation, which extends a series of investigations by Jonathan Corbett, shows that it is no longer a hobby, it is out in the working world.\nThe report looks at the Linux kernel, and so does ignores all those other pieces of the operating system (drivers, applications, desktop interfaces and so on). Still, the kernel is the heart of the OS and \u0026ldquo;one of the largest individual components on almost any Linux system. It also features one of the fastest-moving development processes and involves more developers than any other open source project.\u0026rdquo; So this report, which \u0026ldquo;looks at how that process works, focusing on nearly three years of kernel history as represented by the 2.6.11 through 2.6.24 releases.\u0026rdquo; is a valuable window on what may happen to successful open source projects as they mature.\nOne of the highlights: \u0026ldquo;over 70% of all kernel development is demonstrably done by developers who are being paid for their work\u0026rdquo;. 14% is contributed by developers who are known to be unpaid and independent, and 13% by people who may or may not be paid (unknown), so the amount done by paid workers may be as high as 85%. The Linux kernel, then, is largely the product of professionals, not volunteers.\nSo Linux has become an economic joint venture of a set of companies, in the same way that Visa is an economic joint venture of a set of financial institutions. As the Linux Foundation report makes clear, the companies are participating for a diverse set of commercial reasons. Some want to make sure that Linux runs on their hardward. Others want to make sure that the basis of their distribution business is solid. And so on, and none of these companies could achieve their goals independently. In the same way, Visa provides services in many different locations around the world in different sizes and types of stores. Some banks need their service mainly in one country, some in another, but when they work together they all get to provide their services all around the world.\nThis does not mean that Linux was always a commercial venture, or that all open source projects are commercial ventures. To invoke another parallel, open source software is a creative venture like music. Many people create music for all kinds of reasons. Most people create music for an audience of one when they hum in the kitchen or sing in the shower. A smaller (but still huge) number of people get together to form groups or participate in orchestras or bands. They don\u0026rsquo;t earn a living from it, but they love doing it and enjoy their performances. Some might dream of hitting the big time, others are happy being part of their community. Then a much smaller set of people take it a step further. Maybe they are paid to be in an orchestra; maybe they are in a band with a manager and bar gigs around the country. And a lucky few, of course, hit the big time. They get a record deal, find a big audience, and make some real money.\nSo is music produced for love or for money? Both of course, in various proportions across the spectrum. Open source started off as a small-scale set of projects done mainly by volunteers. As the scale and scope of open source projects an increasing number have provided their contributors with some money (augmented perhaps by a waitressing job). Now a few of the most successful have hit the big time and become full-scale economically important commercial enterprises.\nThings change. As open source software has matured and expanded it has become both more unlike the rest of the world and more like it. It will be fascinating to see what comes next, but the Linux Foundation report has made clear that open source has crossed its commercial Rubicon, and there is probably no going back.\nUpdate: follow-up and response to some discussion here.\n","date":1208566241,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"cbd39e74ec6a9e42b277ed917fe44d8a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/linux-grows-up/","publishdate":"2008-04-19T00:50:41Z","relpermalink":"/post/linux-grows-up/","section":"post","summary":"Linux started as a hobby project.

In particular, there is this:\nAlmost a third of respondents claimed that at least one family member had died in aerial bombings in recent years. Many also described themselves as fighting to defend Afghan villagers from air strikes by foreign troops.    \u0026hellip;and this, which I guess many people better informed than I already know:\nAerial bombings and civilian deaths have both increased: The United Nations estimates more than 1,500 civilians were killed last year, as compared with the 900 to 1,000 civilian deaths counted by two studies of the previous year. An analysis of the first nine months of 2007 found the number of air strikes was already 50 per cent higher than the total for 2006.     Civilian bombings emerged as a major theme of the war last year. President Hamid Karzai shed tears in public as he spoke about civilian deaths. In June, a coalition of Afghan aid agencies published a controversial report suggesting that the rate of civilian casualties had doubled from the previous year, and that international forces were starting to rival the Taliban as the greatest source of civilian deaths.    The second was watching Taxi to the Dark Side, the Oscar-winning documentary about torture in Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo, and elsewhere. It made very clear that most detainees (83,000 at the time the film was made) were not detained by the allied forces, many have committed no crime whatsoever, and that torture of the detainees is common. The effect that the torture and murder of Dilawar, the taxi driver of the title, has on his village is not followed up but is not difficult to imagine.\nAerial bombing and torture are not at the centre of the debate over NATO\u0026rsquo;s role in Afghanistan, but they should be. The debate would then not be about how we can best help the people of Afghanistan; it would be about how we can stop damaging them and driving them to desperate measures. As long as these tactics are part of the military operation in Afghanistan then the longer NATO is there, the more enemies it will create.\nTaxi to the Dark Side, which includes many interviews with soldiers involved in torture, shows how the ethics of groups can differ from the intentions of the people that make up those groups. Even an army composed largely of well-meaning individuals can act in fundamentally immoral ways. Just as NATO soldiers cannot tell a Taliban veteran from a villager who abhors the Taliban, so Afghan citizens cannot tell the difference between a soldier who will treat them decently and one who will arrest them for nothing and condemn them to torture. In both cases the safe assumption to make is the cautious one. So all Afghan citizens will be suspicious of and hostile to NATO soldiers and NATO soldiers will be suspicious of and hostile to Afghan citizens whether or not that hostility is deserved by the individuals. And each such hostile encounter justifies the hostility of the other side. While NATO is there it is not easy to see how things can improve.\nWithin Canada, we need to address the question of what kind of war we are part of. The assumption to date is that we are fighting a decent war. As long as aerial bombing and torture are part of the military operation then this is not a decent war.\n","date":1208036592,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"cdd08afa0a46a442d2277eba0cf550b9","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/this-is-not-wha/","publishdate":"2008-04-12T21:43:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/this-is-not-wha/","section":"post","summary":"This is not what I usually write about here, as I have little to add to the discussion over the war in Afghanistan, but two things have made a big impression on me in the last couple of weeks.\nThe first is the series of interviews with 42 members of the Taliban organized by Graeme Smith of the Globe and Mail (link).

Digital technologies are now part of our social fabric, and all \u0026ldquo;the phones and computers, the e-mail and instant messages, and the webpages are manifestations of a more fundamental shift. We now have communications tools that are flexible enough to match our social capabilities and we are witnessing the rise of new ways of coordinating action that take advantage of the change\u0026rdquo; [20].\n_Here Comes Everybody _is an accessible and challenging introduction to these changes - to the many ways every Shem, Shaun and Issy can now share, collaborate, and act together. It combines some great stories with non-technical introductions to some of the key ideas (a little game theory, a little network theory, a few power laws) and is well worth reading \u0026ndash; but it should be read with caution.\nThe reason for this mixed verdict is the dual nature of the book itself. _Here Comes Everybody _has two voices. One (let\u0026rsquo;s call him \u0026lsquo;Shirky\u0026rsquo;) is a perceptive and creative interpreter of the ways that digital technology is changing society. I like and respect Shirky. He is blunt and provocative enough to cut through the mess of questions that come up when tackling something as far-reaching as the Internet, while being even-handed and reserved enough to respect the complexity of his subject. Here is Shirky on the erosion of journalism and photography:\nThere is never going to be a moment when we as a society ask ourselves, \"Do we want this? Do we want the changes that the new flood of production and access and spread of information is going to bring about?\" It has already happened; in many ways, the rise of group-forming networks is best viewed not as an invention but as an event, a thing that has happened in the world that can't be undone. As with the printing press, the loss of professional control will be bad for many of society's core institutions, but it's happening anyway. [p73]    I\u0026rsquo;ve struggled with this message for a few days because I don\u0026rsquo;t like its determinism, but he has convinced me. Shirky separates what is happening from what is desirable (not that everything digital is undesirable) and that\u0026rsquo;s an important separation to make if we are to be at all clear-headed.\nShirky is not a techno-inevitabilist in a broad sense. Nuclear power, for example, \u0026ldquo;is a technology that society can, for the moment, make a decision about\u0026rdquo; [299]. As with driving a car, we \u0026ldquo;have a good deal of control over both the route and the speed with which nuclear power progresses, including the option to simply pull over\u0026rdquo; [299]. But when it comes to digital technologies we are steering a kayak: \u0026ldquo;We are being pushed rapidly down a route largely determined by the technological environment\u0026hellip; Our principal challenge is not to decide where we want to go but rather to stay upright as we go there.\u0026rdquo; [300]\nThe other voice (let\u0026rsquo;s call him \u0026lsquo;Clay\u0026rsquo;) is a techno-enthusiast and an inveterate story-teller. When Clay looks at the Internet he sees no reason for worry - he sees freedom and unlimited potential. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;the largest increase in expressive capability in the history of the human race\u0026rdquo; [106], bringing with it a world in which, when \u0026ldquo;people care enough, they can come together and accomplish things of a scope and longevity that were previously impossible; they can do big things for love.\u0026rdquo; [142] Shirky may warn that there are losses from social changes, but Clay is breezily dismissive: \u0026ldquo;The spread of cheap and widely available creative tools is sad for people in the advertising business in the same way that movable type was sad for scribes \u0026ndash; the loss from this kind of change is real but limited and is accompanied by a generally beneficial social change.\u0026rdquo; [209] This is the logic of The Lottery - the short story in which one person is stoned so that others can be better off.\nI blame Clay and his enthusiasms for the two major flaws of this book.\nThe first is a fallacy of composition. Clay looks at the Internet and sees lots of groups forming (and things are easy to see on the Internet because even our most casual utterances get stored on someone\u0026rsquo;s servers for posterity to investigate) and he concludes that the world is alight with a new groupiness, the likes of which we have never seen. From time to time Shirky pipes up to remind his alter ego that this is not enough, that \u0026ldquo;treating the internet as some sort of separate space\u0026hellip; was part of the problem\u0026rdquo; [194]. \u0026ldquo;The internet augments real-world social life rather than providing an alternative to it\u0026rdquo; [196]. One implication of Shirky\u0026rsquo;s caution is that, to evaluate the state of groups in our world, we also have to look at how our use of the Internet may have displaced other forms of group building. But while Shirky knows all about Bowling Alone, Clay is too busy running off to tell us a story about Meetup.com to take a really close look at how those positives and negatives are adding up.\nWhile Clay is telling us all about the use of digital technology to spark innovative forms of protest in Belarus, which is a fascinating story, we really need Shirky to ask why, with all these group-forming tools at our disposal and despite the documented disillusionment with the war in Iraq, there is so little coherent protest happening compared to previous wars? Is it really the case that society now is becoming, thanks to the internet, more democratic, more collaborative, and more cooperative than before? I am not convinced. Clay is in danger of making the same mistakes that William Greider made in One World, Ready or Not, and which Paul Krugman demolishes - of finding lots of examples of groups and inferring that the world must have more groups in it than it used to - but that logic is flawed.\nNow Shirky is far too well-informed to fall into this kind of trap. Shirky recognizes that, just as removal of a bottleneck at one point in a highway may prompt a new bottleneck to form a few miles down the road, so the \u0026ldquo;removal of technological limits has exposed a second set of social ones\u0026rdquo; [91]. But Clay\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasms mean that the book is unbalanced, and this second set of limits never really gets investigated closely. Clay the enthusiast wins out over Shirky the dispassionate observer. If you are going to argue that groups are forming as never before, and if you are going to use minor events like angry airline passengers protesting about being trapped on runways to claim that \u0026ldquo;Consumers now talk back to businesses and speak out to the general public, and they can do so en masse and in coordinate ways\u0026rdquo; [179] then you really have to think about consumer activity before digital technology. Here is \u0026ldquo;talking back to business\u0026rdquo; with a vengeance:\nAugust [1800] - Notwithstanding that the last day of this month was a Sunday, it was marked as the commencement of a serious riot. A great increase in the price of provisions, more especially of bread, had roused the vindictive spirit of the poorer classes to an almost ungovernable pitch. They began late in the evening, by breaking the windows of a baker in Millstone Lane, and in the morning proceeded, with an increase of numbers and renewed impetuosity, to treat others of the same trade in the same unwelcome manner. Granaries were broken into at the canal wharfs, and it was really distressing to see with what famine-impelled eagerness many a mother bore away corn in her apron to feed her offspring. [[link](http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/greensmill/shhist.htm)]    Do consumers have a stronger voice now than in the past? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but I do know that a story or two about American Airlines passengers is not going to convince me. If Clay wants to tell us about a student group using Facebook to protest about British Bank HSBC\u0026rsquo;s cancellation of interest-free loans then perhaps he should think about the longstanding student boycott of Barclays Bank during the 1970\u0026rsquo;s and 1980\u0026rsquo;s that contributed to the end of apartheid. But he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and that\u0026rsquo;s disappointing.\nThe second flaw - also a common one - is a reluctance to follow the money. Between them, Clay and Shirky convince me that the Internet marks a change; that a society with an Internet is different from a society without one. Also, they convince me that the Internet is not a single model of sharing/collaboration/collective action; it\u0026rsquo;s many models. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about these models, about which ones have legitimacy and longevity and which don\u0026rsquo;t. To do so requires Shirky to take the broad brush that Clay is using and to start to make smaller, more detailed points.\nPerhaps we no longer need books telling us that the Internet is a big thing. It is time to treat that fact, as Shirky sometimes does, as the starting point for a discussion rather than the conclusion. The questions then become ones of what kind of structures will form and persist in the online world, and if you are going to talk about these questions then you have to address the economics of the problem.\nMoney matters.\nPeople\u0026rsquo;s willingness to contribute to Wikipedia, Shirky points out, is tied to the non-profit status of Wikipedia. A threat from Spanish participants to start an alternative version convinced founder Jimmy Wales to \u0026ldquo;formally forgo any future commerical plans for Wikipedia, and to move the site from Wikipedia.com to Wikipedia.org, in keeping with its nonprofit status. Similarly, he decided to adopt the GNU Free Documentation License for Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s content [which] assured contributors that their contributions would remain frerely available\u0026rdquo; [274]. There is an ongoing tension between contributors to sites and the \u0026ldquo;owners\u0026rdquo; of those sites that is visible on MySpace (see Billy Bragg\u0026rsquo;s efforts to gain musicians rights over their content), on Facebook (the failed \u0026ldquo;Beacon\u0026rdquo; program as one example) and even Google and the line it walks with advertising content on its search results. Contributor-driven movie database IMDB was taken over by Amazon, but Amazon does not put its name on the pages of the site - does it fear that people would not contribute so freely if they realized they were just making Jeff Bezos even richer? The book ends with a story by Clay about a successful revolt by participants at digg.com - but once again, a story is not enough to support the thesis he is trying to make.\nThere are many issues of democracy, ownership, privacy and control that, depending on how they are resolved, will influence our chances of staying upright as we get carried along by this technological flood. Clay Shirky shows in this book that he has many insights that we can use, but to really help steer this kayak we need more Shirky and less Clay.\n","date":1207513814,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"7db0d38716f17fb131b76927192429e4","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/here-comes-ever/","publishdate":"2008-04-06T20:30:14Z","relpermalink":"/post/here-comes-ever/","section":"post","summary":"Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations, Clay Shirky, Penguin, 2008.\n\u0026ldquo;We are living\u0026rdquo;, says Clay Shirky, \u0026ldquo;in the middle of a remarkable increase in our ability to share, to cooperate with one another, and to take collective action, all outside the framework of traditional institutions and organizations\u0026rdquo; [p. 20].

In the war between distribution and concentration of information, the issues and conflicts seem intractable. [xvii]    In the world of the Internet, at least in the years leading up to 2004 when the book was published, these poles of anarchy and oligarchy manifest themselves technologically. Anarchy is the \u0026ldquo;ideology of peer-to-peer systems\u0026rdquo; such as the file-sharing and media-sharing networks that have followed Napster; it is characterized by a fluid, decentralized architecture in which \u0026ldquo;all the \u0026lsquo;thinking\u0026rsquo;.. happens at the end point\u0026rdquo; and in which there is \u0026ldquo;no discernible command-and-control system\u0026rdquo; [17]. On the other side, digital rights management is the technology of oligarchy, imposing controls on what you can and cannot do with the software and media that you buy (or, increasingly, license). I don\u0026rsquo;t usually buy the technology-determines-behaviour line, but his discussion of what it means for a technology to \u0026ldquo;have an ideology\u0026rdquo; is the best I\u0026rsquo;ve read, and is well illustrated by the distinction between technologies that operate on the basis of protocols (handshakes, conventions) and those that work on the basis of controls.\nWhen I first picked up this book (from my library) I assumed that the author was another techno-utopian and that he is firmly on the side of freedom and anarchy over control and oligarchy (as who but the most unromantic of us could not be)? Not unreasonable, given chapter titles like_ Hacking the Currency_ and The Peer-to-Peer Revolution and the Future of Music, but wrong. In fact, although his heart is with the anarchists, Siva Vaidhyanathan is best described as a librarian. Not as in somebody who works in a library, but as in someone who is a fan of libraries:\nLibrarians should be our heroes. The library is not just functionally important to communities all over the world; it embodies Enlightenment values in the best sense. A library is a temple devoted to the antielitist notion that knowledge should be cheap if not free -- doors should be open. Supporting libraries -- monetarily, spiritually, intellectually, and legally -- is one of the best things we can do for the life we hope to build for the rest of the century. [Page 119]    Libraries seem anachronistic \u0026ndash; if they did not already exist, they could not be created now (in North America anyway) \u0026ndash; and yet they are among the most popular of institutions. People make jokes (deserved or not) about the service of the post office, the inflexibility of government, and the so on, but no one (well, apart from Seinfeld) pokes fun at libraries. Even some libertarians, who see any path laid by the state as a road to serfdom, love libraries. Our local libraries are always busy, and after a bad patch some time ago appear to be thriving with their mix of Internet access, DVD and CD rentals and, of course, loads of books. The popularity of the library surely comes from its nature as patron-focused but not commercial (no \u0026ldquo;consumers\u0026rdquo; here) and state sponsored but not monopolistic. It is populist and yet highbrow.\nIn the end Vaidhyanathan takes a dialectical stance and rejects both anarchy and oligarchy in favour of the library - a civic, noncommercial, open and public model. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see this coming until well into the book, which after the first couple of chapters is more a set of essays around a common topic than a sequential argument. I thought he was heading towards one more simplistic agenda (\u0026ldquo;information wants to be free\u0026rdquo; anyone?) but he pulls himself back from the brink and ends up writing [185] \u0026ldquo;The heart of my argument in this book is a call for modesty and patience\u0026rdquo; and this:\nThe urge to break heads, to do the bidding of oligarchy by any means necessary is intimately linked to specters of anarchy. The urge towards anarchy depends on oligarchic abuses. Each creates the conditions that allow the other to thrive. The question for us in the twenty--first century should not be choosing anarchy or oligarchy by constructing and maintaining systems that discourage both. Anarchy is a reaction, not a vision or solution that can produce the best society and the best human future. [187]    One of the reasons he pulls back is a debate with Randy Cohen of the New York Times, which he describes with admirable honesty [63].\n\"The history of popular culture is a continuous struggle on the artists' part not to get robbed... it seems to me that what MP3 [digital music] does is democratize the ability to rip off an artist,\" Cohen wrote to me. \"And what's particularly galling is that you not only want to do it, you want to be praised as a social progressive when you do.\" He got me. That's my schtick. By the guiding principles Cohen deployed in our peer-to-peer debate, I had no escape. He considered copyright to be an artists' right and concern; I consider the chief player in the copyright system to be the corporation.    The artists\u0026rsquo; struggle continues. The commercial oligarchs do whatever they can to avoid paying artists, as the Hollywood writers\u0026rsquo; strike showed and as recent press about royalty awards not being passed on to artists makes clear. But the free-use techno-anarchists exploit artists too. Greatest Living Englishman Billy Bragg writes in the New York Times about how he advised Michael Birch, the founder of social networking site Bebo.com, on how to handle artistic content on the site (via Nicholas Carr). Bragg was angry that while artists contributed to the site, Michael Birch sold it to AOL for $850million and the artists got nothing. Here is part of his op-ed:\nHe was hoping to expand his business by hosting music and wanted my advice on how to construct an artist-centered environment where musicians could post original songs without fear of losing control over their work. Following our talks, Mr. Birch told the press that he wanted Bebo to be a site that worked for artists and held their interests first and foremost.     In our discussions, we largely ignored the elephant in the room: the issue of whether he ought to consider paying some kind of royalties to the artists. After all, wasn’t he using their music to draw members — and advertising — to his business? Social-networking sites like Bebo argue that they have no money to distribute — their value is their membership. Well, last week Michael Birch realized the value of his membership. I’m sure he’ll be rewarding those technicians and accountants who helped him achieve this success. Perhaps he should also consider the contribution of his artists.     The musicians who posted their work on Bebo.com are no different from investors in a start-up enterprise. Their investment is the content provided for free while the site has no liquid assets. Now that the business has reaped huge benefits, surely they deserve a dividend...     If young musicians are to have a chance of enjoying a fruitful career, then we need to establish the principle of artists’ rights throughout the Internet — and we need to do it now.    Instead of cheering for one side or the other, Vidhyanathan\u0026rsquo;s book foresees and acknowledges both these problems. And problems they are. He does not offer clear or simple solutions, but he points us thoughtfully in the right direction, and that\u0026rsquo;s a very valuable contribution. So I definitely recommend the book, even though I wish it were a bit less scattered than it is (and that it had a better index). It\u0026rsquo;s an exploration, not a recipe for the future, and has the rough edges that come with that territory, but there is a lot of food for thought in the pages.\nThe Anarchist in the Library, written in 2004, is already a bit outdated. Not the author\u0026rsquo;s fault of course, but it is already odd to read a book about the Internet that has no mention of Wikipedia and no index entry for Google. These recent developments have changed the nature of the Internet. Peer to peer networks are still around, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think they are the defining feature of the Internet. If we think of music we think of iTunes, not Napster; if we think of books we think of Amazon; if we think of social networks we think of Facebook and MySpace. None of these are peer-to-peer: they are centralized technologies built on the basis of controls, not protocols. Software architecture is often described as a stack, and while the low-level plumbing of the Internet remains a peer to peer protocol, the higher levels of the stack are \u0026ldquo;platforms\u0026rdquo; or client-server models of request and response. The techno-capitalist digirati have moved happily onto such platforms, and the centralization of ownership that they carry with them. In the era of utility computing, peer-to-peer networks appear to be on the wane.\nThere is one other place in which I think Vaidhyanathan gets it wrong. He underestimates the role of information asymmetries and transaction costs. He says that \u0026ldquo;Major record labels perform four basic tasks: production, distribution, price fixing, and gatekeeping\u0026rdquo; [48]. But there is a fifth, which is promotion. Simply putting a record on the Internet is hardly more effective than playing your music on your front lawn - the problems of finding something no one knows exists are far greater than he credits. One major function of libraries, after all, is to match readers and books (\u0026ldquo;Every reader his/her book\u0026rdquo; in one of Ranganathan\u0026rsquo;s five laws of library science \u0026ndash; thanks John). When Vaidhyanathan tells a journalist that African musicians don\u0026rsquo;t need record companies because \u0026ldquo;The artists can do it all themselves for less than $10,000\u0026rdquo; he is naive. Billy Bragg\u0026rsquo;s friends on Bebo did the same, and it got them nowhere. Others have proclaimed this line before - for example Chris Anderson in my least favourite book talks about the band Birdmonster who eschewed labels\nLabel were calling with deals, but Birdmonster turned the offers down. As [lead singer Peter] Arcuni put it, “We’re not anti-label in principle, but the numbers (risk vs. reward) didn’t add up.”   A music label exists primarily to fulfill four functions: 1) talent scouting; 2) financing (the advances bands get to pay for their studio time is like seed capital invested by a venture capitalist); 3) distribution; 4) marketing.     From Birdmonster’s perspective, they didn’t need that.    Well, apparently they do now. The problem is that so much of culture is governed by asymmetric information, information cascades, and network effects. You don\u0026rsquo;t know what a book is going to be like until you buy it, so simply knowledge of the existence of a book is insufficient - you need recommendations and reliable ones at that. I\u0026rsquo;ve gone on about this in various ways here and here and here. His neglect of these forces is one of the reasons I thought he was heading down the techno-utopian path, but as I say he ends up, thankfully, rejecting the \u0026ldquo;California Ideology\u0026rdquo; [155] in favour of something less catchy, less simple, but more hopeful.\n","date":1206394225,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"2caad12ee6048301cfe1c216b2cb34d9","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-anarchist-i/","publishdate":"2008-03-24T21:30:25Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-anarchist-i/","section":"post","summary":"The Anarchist in the Library, Siva Vaidhyanathan, Basic Books 2004.\nSiva Vaidhyanathan (see here and here) sees the central problem of the Internet and of society as a whole, as the tension between decentralization/freedom/anarchy and centralization/control/oligarchy.\nThe great challenge in the new century is to mediate between two divergent trends -- anarchy and oligarchy.

Most visitors no longer come in by the front door to take a tour. Instead, Mr. Google (a travel agent who doubles as our butler) directs them straight down to the basement where the family archives are kept and tells them to look at one particular historical document called [The Netflix Prize: 300 Days Later](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2007/07/the-limitations.html). They read this and then they walk right out.  I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t complain. It\u0026rsquo;s nice that they visit at all - much better than rattling around here by myself - so I should be very grateful to Mr. Google for bringing these people to visit, but it does leave me wondering why he always sends them to look at this same corner of the house. I have a few other items lying around that I think are just as pretty but Mr. Google takes the visitors right by them without so much as a glance.\nSo when he brought me the sherry decanter the other day I challenged him on it. I thought it was an innocent enough question to ask of one\u0026rsquo;s butler. Little did I realize the terrifying journey I was embarking on with that one question. He explained that when you ask him a question he \u0026ldquo;understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u0026rdquo; That sounded a little presumptuous so I asked him how he could be so confident in his understanding and he replied, rather stiffly if you ask me, \u0026ldquo;If I did not give you exactly what you wanted then you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have asked me in the first place would you?\u0026rdquo; There was something about the slow, pronounced way he articulated this that made me feel like Wooster to his Jeeves so I didn\u0026rsquo;t pursue the topic, fearing he would get upset. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want him to leave; it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to find good help nowadays.\nAs I sipped my sherry I realized that I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand the man. For a butler and travel agent he seems remarkably well-to-do, and yet when I ask why he works so hard (I happen to know he is butler at several other houses in the county as well as mine) he insists he is only interested in helping people and points to his family motto, which he keeps on a little card that he brandishes frequently. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be evil\u0026rdquo;, it says.\nStill, after a few glasses I still felt a little bolshie over Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s tone and I remembered that some months previous he had actually given me a copy of his biography (he is a most talented individual, I grant). He had told me it was an authorized volume with interviews and selections of his personal correspondence. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t paid much attention to it at the time, but now I took a candle, wandered over to the west wing of Whimsley Hall, and climbed the stone staircase to the very top, where the library is. There I found the biography already lying on a table by the window, which was strange because I had never taken it off the shelf before, and as I sat down to read I realized that it does indeed tell me all about our Mr Google.\nWas I surprised! The biography was a revelation. I don\u0026rsquo;t get out often these days (it\u0026rsquo;s the gout) and I am now woefully out of touch, but it turns out that there is more to Mr. Google than I ever dreamed. He is responsible for an astonishingly popular free publication called Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the most remarkable books you\u0026rsquo;ll ever read - if you open it twice you never see quite the same page. In fact the only book I\u0026rsquo;ve ever heard of to match it is a limited edition print called \u0026ldquo;The Book of Sand\u0026rdquo; that my friend Mr. Borges had in his library before he went mad.\nHere is how Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook works.\nA long time ago, people used signposts to get where they wanted to go. Each signpost was a little underlined phrase in blue that took you to a new place. People would wander all over the place, hopping from one place to another, looking at signposts to see where to go next. These signposts made a sort of map. The complete map of the world is a very big and complicated thing of course, but here is a little piece of it (thanks to this article).\n\nMr. Google realized that most people don\u0026rsquo;t really want maps, they want guidebooks. And he also realized how he could use those signposts to build a good guidebook. When someone puts up a signpost it shows that they feel this destination is a place worth going to. Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook is very well indexed, so when you look up something like \u0026ldquo;I would like to visit a peaceful country retreat\u0026rdquo; it takes you to a page of recommendations. To generate these recommendations Mr. Google counted all the signposts that pointed to peaceful country retreats and pick those retreats that most signposts pointed to. \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rdquo;, he would say, \u0026ldquo;I recommend you go to Harburn House, or Green Mountain Bed and Breakfast\u0026rdquo;. Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook became something of a sensation. Once it was established, he put in a few advertisements alongside each question and made a pretty penny from it.\nAs I read further, a storm rose up in the west. The candle flickered as the wind came in through the ill-fitting windows. Maybe this forbidding atmosphere explains why the more I read the more I worried that there might be something a little sinister about our Mr. Google. Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook has become very influential. In fact, I understand he now has a cave somewhere in view of the mountains that is full of large and noisy engines, with powerful pistons cranking away to produce new versions every day. That initial guide of his, so clean and tidy, has become a monstrous device like one of those machines designed by Mr. Goldberg or Mr. Robinson. He claims that every edition of his guide \u0026ldquo;considers more than 500 million variables and 2 billion terms\u0026rdquo;.\nIt was late at night by the time I read this remarkable fact, and I\u0026rsquo;d had several more glasses of sherry. A particularly strong gust rattled the window and I stood up to close the shutters. The wind blew the window open and I had to reach out to grab it. It was then that I noticed in the distance a flash of flame and a column of thick black smoke rising in the distance from right near Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s cave! It looked positively diabolical. I believe I actually cried out in shock.\nAfter a tussle I got the shutters closed and, shaken, returned to my leatherbound armchair and took another sip to calm my nerves. My mind was racing. \u0026ldquo;Come on Whimsley\u0026rdquo;, I thought, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just imagining things\u0026rdquo;. How could there be anything sinister about the Guidebook? I opened a page of the biography at random and it set my mind somewhat at ease. Here is what I read:\nAt some universities, administrators are taking a new approach to deciding where to put footpaths. At first they don't put footpaths anywhere; they just let students walk across the grass to get where they need to go, wearing away the grass and creating rough tracks as they do so. Then when it is clear where the popular tracks go the university can just tidy them up, put down some paving stones, and they have a path in the right place. It's called the Wisdom of Crowds. The students decide where the paths go by just going about their everyday life, and the university taps into their preferences to design an environment that reflects exactly what the students would want to do. That's what we've done here at _Mr. Google's Guidebook_. We track how people walk around, which signposts they follow, and that lets us put paths in the right place, just where you want them to be. We can lead you just where you want to go; lead you to interesting and even unexpected destinations that will provide you with just what you asked for, and more. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s all it is then, I thought. Maybe everyone wants to read about the Netflix Prize and no one wants to read 25 essays about the Long Tail. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve had one moment of startling insight amidst so much dross. But somehow, as my mood plumbed new depths, my brain clung to a stubborn belief that the prettiest thing in Whimsley Hall is an ancient manuscript that sets out, with wit and panache, the problems with toilets. This gem lies in a corner covered with grime and neglected by Mr. Google. How could I possibly explain such gross inequity? Pondering this problem, I fell asleep in the chair and drifted into a strange dream\u0026hellip;\nI was standing with my mother in York; one of many visits some years ago. She was pointing to a Chinese take-away restaurant that occupied one narrow division of a long terrace of houses and shops on one of the old streets of that city. - Look at that, she said, Why is that restaurant right where it is? Why does it go from here to here (gesturing to the edges of the restaurant) rather than some other place? - I have no idea. - It\u0026rsquo;s because of the vikings. Over a thousand years ago the land was divided, and then subdivided as it was passed down from father to sons. Each son inherited a narrower strip, so that it had access to the road, and as a result property lines were narrow. Over the years new buildings have been erected until the current use of land has nothing to do with the original, and yet the boundaries remain; archaic, obsolete, and yet fixed. Unless a new motorway comes through they may stay the same way for another thousand years. - How strange, I commented. - Not as strange as the egg rolls, she replied\u0026hellip; Then I was in a train, reading a newspaper article about Alfred Wainwright\u0026rsquo;s classic hand-written guides to the paths of the Lake District. It explained that, while the routes of footpaths usually evolved over time rendering such guides as Wainwright\u0026rsquo;s obsolete, the very success of Mr. Wainwright\u0026rsquo;s magnificent effort had preserved their relevance. People used the guides to follow the paths, cementing the routes in place for much longer than would have been the case without them.\nI awoke with a start. What an odd thing to remember. Why now? My mother is in fine fettle - no worries there. And Wainwright\u0026rsquo;s Guides? I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought of them in years. It must be something else that produced that dream. And then I realized, it was all about Mr. Google\u0026rsquo;s Guidebook. I struck my forehead, blinded by this insight, and rushed to the table. Picking up the quill pen, I dipped it in the ink and began to write feverishly on the pad of paper lying there\u0026hellip;\nMr. Google is lying! (I wrote) His Guidebook no longer reflects the paths set out by travellers as they navigate their lives. It is no longer an outside observer of people's wanderings. Google's success has changed the way people find their routes. Here is the way it happens. When a new cluster of destinations is built there may be a flurry of interest, with new signposts being erected pointing towards one or another of those competing locations. And those signposts have their own dynamics, perhaps forming a power law as [set out by Mr. Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html) or perhaps something different, as [Mr. Shalizi has explained](http://en.scientificcommons.org/22568192). But that's not the end of the story. After some initial burst, no one makes new signposts to this cluster of destinations any more. And no one uses the old signposts to select which particular destination to visit. Instead everyone uses Mr. Google's Guidebook. It becomes the major determinant of the way people travel; no longer a guide to an existing geography it now shapes the geography itself, becoming the most powerful force of all in many parts of the land. So my Netflix Prize essay got selected by Mr. Google's machines as one of the more interesting and insightful commentaries - the machines are perceptive, we must grant them that - and it soon appeared as number 3 on the list of recommended destinations for anyone looking for \"[Netflix Prize](http://www.google.ca/search?q=netflix+prize)\", right after the official site itself. And now no one is guided here by those few original links - the relevance of their effect is as vestigial as the effect of the Vikings' property rules. Mr. Google's Guidebook has cemented the verdict in place long after the early discussion has lost its relevance, like the edges of the Chinese take-away and like Mr. Wainwright's guides fixed the routes of the paths he charted. With little new being written about the Netflix Prize the Guidebook is the major source of new journeys. And so the Guidebook changes the pattern of the landscape from a rich, linked one with its power law shape (or other shape). Instead, there is a two stage process in the evolution of much of the landscape. The first stage is a brief discussion, from which Mr. Google picks a few winners. In the second stage, after that discussion has faded away, the continuing popularity of the winners is assured simply by their positioning in the Guidebook. Mr. Google has singlehandedly changed the way people travel, changing the selection of destinations from an ongoing referendum to a brief discussion from which he anoints a few winners.Mr. Google no longer gives you what you want, he selects a winner from the crowd and then tells you it's what you wanted. I was just about to put down the pen, exhausted now, when I heard a creak and the door to the library opened. I lurched around to see coming through the door \u0026mdash; Mr. Google himself! His face was no longer subservient as befits a butler. Instead it was smirking. And his teeth - surely they had not been so pointed before. I shrank.\nBut Mr. Google did not attack me with a knife, or bite me in the neck. Nothing so dramatic. He simply looked over at my scribbled notes and sighed a world-weary sigh. - You don\u0026rsquo;t understand do you sir? - What do you mean Google? I understand everything now. - Really? This document here? And what does that matter if no one reads it? And who decides whether anyone can come here to view it? Exactly how do you propose to publicize your absurd opinions if not through me?\nMy shoulders sagged. Defeat. Of course, there was nothing I could do. \u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;ll silence it then. Keep people away. My revelations will moulder, along with that masterpiece about the toilets\u0026rdquo;.\n No (said Google). That\u0026rsquo;s what I mean - you really don\u0026rsquo;t understand. You see, I don\u0026rsquo;t care if people come and look at these hen scratches or not. Maybe they will, maybe they won\u0026rsquo;t. As long as I can sell a few advertisements on that page of my guidebook I really don\u0026rsquo;t care. After all, what better praise for a Guidebook than to help people find out what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with it? Just leave your manuscript with me. I\u0026rsquo;ll look after it.  He held out his hand, imperious now. I felt disheveled after my long night. My brain was spinning. I could see no alternative. In a vain attempt to maintain some self-respect I drew myself up to my full height and pulled back my shoulders, adopting a bearing appropriate for my class. \u0026ldquo;All right Google. Here you go. Don\u0026rsquo;t lose it now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you sir. You can be sure I won\u0026rsquo;t lose it. I never do lose anything you know.\u0026rdquo;\nI turned away from him and stumbled down the stairs. I had ended up giving him an order, and he had accepted it. Yet I could not shake the impression, even as he brought me a glass of sherry that evening in my sitting room, placing the silver tray beside me with deference, that Mr. Google - far from being a butler and travel guide - was more a master than a servant.\n","date":1204900766,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"7256fcb8643573135e58aa6fc7c0a45f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/mr-googles-guid/","publishdate":"2008-03-07T14:39:26Z","relpermalink":"/post/mr-googles-guid/","section":"post","summary":"Whimsley Hall is now strewn, like Miss Haversham's house, with cobwebs and dust.

Interesting, if a bit beyond an ex-chemist. But reading quantum things again reminded me of The Best Quantum Thing I Ever Learned, which - outside chemists - seems little known. So I\u0026rsquo;ll tell the story here as briefly as I can - Wikipedia now has a good set of entries on this if you want to know more, including fancy moving pictures: start at haemoglobin. All the images here are borrowed from Wikipedia.\nBreathe in.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s going on? You draw oxygen into your lungs; from there it passes to the bloodstream; from there to muscles and nerves. To make that journey oxygen molecules (O2) stick to molecules of haemoglobin in red blood cells, which carry them until they get to a place where they are needed, at which point the oxygen molecules hop off the haemoglobin to do their work.\nMore precisely, an oxygen molecule sticks to an iron atom at the centre of one of four \u0026ldquo;haem\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;heme\u0026rdquo; groups that are part of each haemoglobin molecule. Here is a picture of a haem group with its iron atom (Fe) surrounded by four nitrogen atoms. There is actually a fifth Nitrogen atom at right angles to the diagram (\u0026ldquo;behind\u0026rdquo; the Fe), that is in turn attached to the long \u0026ldquo;globin\u0026rdquo; chain.\nIf haemoglobin was just a passive lump onto which oxygen molecules stick then breathing would not work. The first oxygen molecule to bump into a haemoglobin can attach to one of four iron atoms, and so would tend attach more frequently than the second (which has only three spots to attach to), which would attach more frequently than the third and the fourth. So unless oxygen was present in great excess, there would be empty seats left on each haemoglobin as it stops by the lungs to collect its passengers. In the same way, when the oxygen molecules step off from the haemoglobin at the end of the line, the last one would have the least tendency to leave - haemoglobins may have some passengers returning for a round trip. We would have to breathe much harder than we do to get the oxygen to our muscles.\nBut, as Max Perutz found out a few decades ago, haemoglobin is much more than a passive lump.\nWhen haemoglobin is empty of oxygen, the haem groups - each of which is attached to one of the four \u0026ldquo;globin\u0026rdquo; strands that wrap themselves up to form the blob-shaped haemoglobin molecule - are near to the surface of the blob but are not openly exposed. When the first oxygen molecule attaches, it triggers a slight change in the local structure of the haem group, and this in turn tugs on the globin so that the other haem sites are exposed, and more easily attract oxygen molecules. It\u0026rsquo;s this opening up as oxygen attaches that is the root of haemoglobin\u0026rsquo;s efficiency, and the switch that triggers it is a quantum one.\nBefore the oxygen attaches, the iron sits slightly out of the plane of the four nitrogen atoms. But when the oxygen attaches, the iron atom moves into the plane of the ring. This slight movement is the switch, triggering the rearrangement of the globin chain and the exposing of the other haem binding sites. Here is a sideways view, in elaborate ASCII text graphics, of the iron moving into the haem plane.\n N\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; | N\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Fe |\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt;N-----N======N-------N N-----N==Fe==N-----N\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; | |\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; O  What happens to the iron atom to shift it into the plane? To understand that you have to know a bit about how the electrons around the iron atom are arranged.\nElectrons are arranged in shells of course, and each shell holds different numbers of electrons. The innermost shell holds two electrons, the second holds eight, and the third shell can hold 18 electrons. Iron has 14 electrons in the third shell and two electrons in the fourth shell. In haemoglobin, the iron exists as Fe2+, with the two electrons in the 4s orbital removed. We can focus on the 14 electrons in the 3 shell to understand the switch.\nThe 3 shell has a single orbital with zero angular momentum (3s) that, like any orbital, can hold two electrons (one \u0026ldquo;spin up\u0026rdquo;, one \u0026ldquo;spin down\u0026rdquo;). It has three 3p orbitals (6 electrons) with an angular momentum of one and a slightly higher energy. And it has five 3d orbitals with an angular momentum of two and a slightly higher energy still. There are 6 electrons spread among the 3d orbitals (leaving four unoccupied spaces) and these d electrons are the key to the switch.\nWhen six electrons occupy the five 3d orbitals they avoid pairing up if at all possible, and they have spins \u0026ldquo;pointing\u0026rdquo; the same way (Hund\u0026rsquo;s Rule: a consequence of the Pauli Exclusion Principle). By occupying separate orbitals, which generally occupy different regions of space, they keep out of each others\u0026rsquo; way and this lets the negatively-charged get a little closer to the positively-charged nucleus (become more tightly bound) without repelling each other. So the 3d energy levels of an iron atom are like this (the vertical lines are electrons, the horizontal line shows an empty slot where an electron could fit).\n ^\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt;E | || |- |- |- |- \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; |  (The unpaired electrons here, all lined up with spins \u0026ldquo;pointing\u0026rdquo; the same way, are the reason that iron is magnetic.)\nThis labelling of orbitals as 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s and so on is precise only for isolated atoms. But place an iron in a cage and not all the 3d orbitals are at the same energy: there is a \u0026ldquo;ligand field\u0026rdquo; effect that raises the energy of some orbitals more than others. The Nitrogen atoms have a partial negative charge, and (like charges repel) electrons in orbitals that are located largely close to these atoms rise in energy. Those that are mainly distributed away from the Nitrogen atoms will be lower in energy.\nThe shape of the cage determines the change in energy levels (as well as a mixing among them which we can put to one side). Here is an iron atom in a square cage. The five 3d orbitals (in a line on the left of the diagram) have split into distinct levels on the right, with different energies. To untangle the configurations of orbitals in different environments you need to apply group theory ideas to quantum mechanics.\nIf the split between the energy levels is small then Hund\u0026rsquo;s Rule still applies and the electrons will tend to occupy orbitals singly, with spins aligned: this is called the \u0026ldquo;high-spin\u0026rdquo; case. If the split is bigger then the electrons pair up in the lower-energy orbitals: the \u0026ldquo;low-spin\u0026rdquo; case. In the haem group the iron is high-spin. But as the oxygen atom binds to it, bringing another negative charge close to the iron, the pattern changes and (crucially) the magnitude of the splitting among the energy levels increases, and the iron changes to being a low-spin case. And, to cut the story slightly short, this switch to a low-spin Fe2+ ion causes the iron to fit into the plane of the haem group instead of protruding from it, and it drags the fifth nitrogen atom and the globin chain along with it.\nSo breathing, in the end, works only because of a fine balance between magnetism and electron level splittings in iron atoms; it works because quantum mechanics says that electrons occupy discrete energy levels and because we can calculate the order and energy of those levels. What I like is that (unlike most popular quantum topics, which focus on weirdness) this phenomenon that lies behind every breath is no longer a mystery - it\u0026rsquo;s a triumph of understanding and brings the most abstract topics, group theory and quantum mechanics, down to earth.\n","date":1204302216,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"ba1b7c326261842d0d16b0985701f042","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/quantum-breathi/","publishdate":"2008-02-29T16:23:36Z","relpermalink":"/post/quantum-breathi/","section":"post","summary":"Chris next door works at the Perimeter Institute; he is a physicist in the field of quantum information and I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to read some of his papers.

How about this for a paragraph:\nCould Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC? While the Internet rewards competitive innovation, Microsoft has frequently sought to establish proprietary monopolies -- and then leverage its dominance into new, adjacent markets.    David Drummond (Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer) talks about two principles of the Internet: openness and innovation.\nWe take Internet openness, choice and innovation seriously. They are the core of our culture.    The beauty of this stance is that you can play the openness and innovation off against each other. Google\u0026rsquo;s important software is just as proprietary, closed source, and hidden as that of Microsoft - in fact more so because M$ has shared source agreements with many companies while Google\u0026rsquo;s core technologies are not shared with anyone. Google does not disclose information about things like water consumption at its server stations because it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;competitive matter\u0026rdquo;; Google buys properties under other names because it can get a better deal. In cases like these where Google wants to be secretive they pull the innovation card and talk about innovation and the need to prosper in a competitive market.\nWhen Google wants to promote technologies that are complementary to its own, it makes them open source (for example, in its sponsorship of Firefox browser development) and talks in idealistic terms about \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo;. The overlap of interests between Google and its \u0026ldquo;communities\u0026rdquo; is partial at best, however, and such talk is cheeky, to say the least, coming from some of the world\u0026rsquo;s richest people. And if making its advertising-driven wealth isn\u0026rsquo;t leveraging its dominance in search into new, adjacent markets then I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is.\nIn the end, Google and Microsoft are both profit-maximizing companies. No matter how much they couch their goals in suitably vague idealistic terms (\u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t be evil\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;freedom to innovate\u0026rdquo; respectively) they respond to the incentives faced by all such institutions.

For all those who wanted to read the piece, but just couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring themselves to click the link, here is that posting.\nThe recent PFE blog post by Robert Chernomas and Ian Hudson is a wholesome read. It reminds us that markets and private enterprise deserve less credit than they receive for our current prosperity, such as it is; it lays out the contribution of the state to innovation; it reminds us that unregulated markets are hazardous and often crooked; and it points out that cornerstone social democratic policies such as a healthy minimum wage don\u0026rsquo;t have the dire side effects conservative economics would have us believe they do.\nAnd yet it makes depressing reading.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not here to pick a fight with Chernomas and Hudson (it was a short excerpt from a bigger piece, after all), but it touched a nerve because for all my adult life (ie since the late \u0026lsquo;70s) I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading the same defensive tone from left-wing economists and after thirty years it\u0026rsquo;s getting a little stale. Is defending the role of the state the best we can do? I hope not because it\u0026rsquo;s not enough.\nJust to get back to basics, how many of us became left wing because of a belief in the beneficent power of the state per se? Not me and almost certainly not you. Most of us are left wing because we believe that, left to itself, economic wealth is used to exploit the poorer and weaker in society and that the best response to such exploitation is, the the words of Pete Seeger, to stick together. I don\u0026rsquo;t see the word \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; there. Yes, a democratic state has the potential to be a levelling instrument in an unequal society. But it\u0026rsquo;s not the only such instrument and it\u0026rsquo;s not always a reliable one.\nThe non-economist left is not always so cozy with the state. I look on my bookshelf and see titles from the UK in the 1970\u0026rsquo;s like Pluto Press\u0026rsquo;s In and Against the State, and Ralph Miliband\u0026rsquo;s The State in Capitalist Society. They both have harsh words for the institutions of the capitalist state and they identify forces that cause those institutions to act on behalf of the economically powerful. Once you move away from economic policy, most of us on the left are decidedly ambivalent about the state. State institutions have oppressive tendencies; nuclear-armed states are dangerous; the state defends the interests of the powerful. So why, when it comes to economics, are we so tied to the state?\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s because the left is a victim of its own successes. The structural achievements of the post-war world are the great social democratic institutions rooted in the state: the construction of social security, the provision and expansion of public schooling and post-secondary education, public healthcare. We\u0026rsquo;ve identified with these achievements, so ever since Thatcher \u0026amp; Reagan we have stood as conservative (small c) defenders of the state against the market-populist radicals.\nUnfortunately a siege mentality does not encourage adventurous ideas or internal debate, and as a result unorthodox economic ideas on the left, at least the public expression of them that I\u0026rsquo;m aware of, has been stifled. As a non-economist, it seems to me that our attitude to economic ideas that don\u0026rsquo;t stem from the state-driven social democratic tradition is too often one of suspicion. I\u0026rsquo;d love to be proven wrong\u0026hellip;\nStatist social democratic institutions are not the only tradition that we have. We have traditions of self-government from the co-operative movement, we have traditions from the trade union movement of course, from community-focused movements and small-scale economic organizations, and from social protest. The feminist movement has a far more ambivalent relationship to the state than the traditional left. So maybe we can look at some of these for non-state driven left-wing economic ideas too.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, the world has changed in the last thirty years. It need not be defeatist to say that the policy prescriptions of 1970 may not make sense today. After all, would we expect the policies and goals of socialists and social democrats in 1948 to be the same as those of 1910?\nHere is a scatter shot list of policy areas, mainly micro-economic, in which left-wing innovation seems possible, but is happening slowly if at all in Canada. I do hope that I\u0026rsquo;m missing things. Can readers can put me right?\n Corporate ownership The left has a long tradition of supporting worker ownership. A successful example is the John Lewis Partnership that has a prominent position on Britain\u0026rsquo;s High Street. It\u0026rsquo;s commercial, it\u0026rsquo;s a business, and it\u0026rsquo;s worker owned. Have we seen any policy initiatives that encourage and promote this kind of corporate governance?\n Corporate taxation In one blog comment I asked Erin Weir whether the Scandinavian model of low corporate taxation makes sense in Canada. He thought not, but it makes sense to me that in looking at progressive taxation we should direct tax efforts at the owners of corporations, not necessarily the corporations themselves.\n **Innovation **Is there a left-wing innovation policy that goes beyond university research to industrial development, and if so what would it look like? The most interesting idea I\u0026rsquo;ve seen recently is the suggestion of replacing pharmaceutical patents by prizes, supported by Stiglitz and others (short PDF here). Has this idea been followed up in Canada?\n Post-secondary education Historically, the left has been opposed to means testing. But historically we didn\u0026rsquo;t have computers. Stephen Gordon at Worthwhile Canadian Initiative recently argued that the best way to increase the accessibility of post-secondary education is not through cutting tuition fees for all, but through targeted subsidies. When I challenged him on means testing he replied that \u0026ldquo;if we can handle the GST credit, why not use the same data for tuition subsidies?\u0026rdquo; Makes sense to me (even though I am forking out too much money for my son\u0026rsquo;s university).\n Microfinance and community initiatives How does the left feel about the Grameen Bank and its emulators? The movement has been praised and damned from both left and right. Surely there is something there that has relevance to the Canadian experience? I know I dislike the focus of microfinance organizations like kiva.org on \u0026ldquo;entrepreneurs\u0026rdquo;, but perhaps that is just a generational linguistic shift I am not prepared to make. There is also a sense of solidarity in such movements, and a direct approach to providing support for powerless people to take control of their own lives - surely a left-wing goal.\n Public health The debate on health is always phrased in terms of a public system versus a private system, but one of the most successful social health initiatives of the last few decades was sparked by efforts outside both these spheres. The building of a network of sexual assault/rape crisis centres in many of our cities came from feminist activists (see here (PDF) for example) and remains, if I understand it right, at arms length from government. While government funds have been used (and more could be needed) these have not always been state institutions. Are there ways to emulate the success of this movement in other areas of our society, and what policies would promote this kind of emulation?\n Small Business Our relationship to small businesses is ambivalent. We support them when we talk about communities and worry about the impact of big-box stores coming to town, but we don\u0026rsquo;t see them as a partner in an economic sense. What kinds of small-business economic initiatives have come from the left?\n Cities and towns The Jane Jacobs tradition of diversity and small-scale thinking is one that many on the left love, even while some on the right think she\u0026rsquo;s a great thinker too. She was no fan of central planning of course, but she\u0026rsquo;s also no fan of letting cities just grow according to commercial dictates. Why has the left\u0026rsquo;s adoption of her ideas has been piecemeal? Initiatives at the city level (especially in transit/traffic and housing) seem small-scale, but have the potential to spread from country to country in a remarkable way as activists and planners search for inspiration. The London traffic congestion charge and the bike-friendly initiatives of places like Lyons (now spreading to Paris) act as experiments that can be modified and built-on by others.\n  Well, that\u0026rsquo;s probably a confused list. What initiatives have I missed? Is the Canadian economic left less hidebound than I give it credit for?\n","date":1201207199,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"01e11d856c99fcbc67634f8d26a4b1a3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/beyond-defendin/","publishdate":"2008-01-24T20:39:59Z","relpermalink":"/post/beyond-defendin/","section":"post","summary":"The other day I mentioned that I had a posting up at the Relentlessly Progressive Economics blog.

Quotes and page numbers are from an advance copy.\nUnlike most technology commentators Nicholas Carr knows that if you want to predict what\u0026rsquo;s happening next, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to follow the money. And he does so very well, which makes this book (and his weblog) recommended reading for anyone interested in where technology is taking us.\nGoogle is everywhere in The Big Switch and the reason is simple: cost.\nNo corporate computing system, not even the ones operated by very large businesses, can match the efficiency, speed and flexibility of Google's system. One analyst [Martin Reynolds of the Gartner Group: see [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/03/technology/03google.html) ] estimates that Google can carry out a computing task for one tenth of what it would cost a typical company.    That means, if you are a company and you have a computing task to be done that Google already does, you can save a bunch of money and you can now start outsource your CPU cycles just as you previously outsourced other tasks. And that means that the computing landscape will get shaken up. Not in a matter of months, but over the next decade or so. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how quickly we get used to a landscape and many of us are now so accustomed to PC\u0026rsquo;s and the basic layout of corporate computing systems that they seem almost natural. But Carr warns us that this is going to change and, as if to confirm his claims, last week Sun Microsystems, supplier of many of the computers that make up corporate data centres, announced that by 2015 it won\u0026rsquo;t have a single data centre. Information Technology is not sacrosanct.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s cost advantage comes partly from a built-in inefficiency of corporate computing: capacity underutilization. Many applications demand their own servers, and those servers must be able to handle the peak load that the application will experience even if that peak load happens only rarely. As a result most corporate computers, most of the time, do nothing except consume electricity and produce heat. This inefficiency was unavoidable until recently, but now high-speed Internet availability makes it possible for companies that have the resources (Google and a few others) to build warehouses full of servers that look like power stations (see Google\u0026rsquo;s The Dalles centre in Oregon, below, with two football-stadium-sized buildings full of perhaps 60,000 servers). And then they can supply CPU cycles over the Internet just like electrical utilities supply electricity. The demand on Google\u0026rsquo;s CPU cycles is smoothed out, being balanced among many consumers in different timezones with different needs, and that only helps their efficiency. It\u0026rsquo;s what Carr calls utility computing.\nThe first half of The Big Switch is given over to convincing us that utility computing is the wave of the future, and the second half of the book explores the implications - many of them disturbing - of this switch. The good news is that both are thought-provoking and open up a lot of questions. The less good news is that to cover all this ground Carr has to skim and, at 250 pages, this short book can\u0026rsquo;t delve very deeply into any of the questions.\nThe argument for the switch to utility computing is made by drawing an analogy between the history of electricity supply and the history of computing. A century ago factories generated their own electricity and many of the fears that people have of outsourcing computing were faced by the nascent electrical industry. Would companies trust their lifeblood to an external source? Can they the get guarantees they need to go over to this new model? History shows that they did, and quickly. Will computing go the same way? Carr says yes.\nI broadly agree (in the long run) but there are reasons to think the Big Switch may be less than complete. First, there is an intermediate solutuion that companies are already adopting, which is \u0026ldquo;virtualization software\u0026rdquo; that allows them to run many \u0026ldquo;virtual computers\u0026rdquo; on a smaller number of real computers, so making better use of the real CPU cycles. The technology is booming and the savings are huge. And while this may still be more expensive than the full-fledged utility model, to the extent that many software packages are customized for individual companies (not so much word processors and so on as the ERP systems that many companies run their business on) a utility model may not be applicable. Whether the benefits of custom applications will win out over the cheapness of commodity software is open to debate. Second, while electricity is a relatively simple thing, computing is complex. Carr only scratches the surface of what forms utility computing will take. Will companies and consumers pay bills for complete applications (the salesforce.com model), for storage (Amazon\u0026rsquo;s S3, for example), for virtual computers on which they can install their own applications (now also starting to be offered by Amazon), or what? And third, from the consumer side, the flip side of the unused CPU cycles efficiency argument is that we may be prepared to pay for a computer to run the latest games and then, well, the marginal cost of using those CPU cycles is very low. In fact, they are starting to be used (Seti @home and others) by central applications - rented back (or donated back) to others. It is clear that the utility model is making ground in the consumer space (how much of our time do we spend in the browser) but the reasons are, I think, different from the electricity analogy Carr pursues.\nBut this is splitting hairs, because the broad trend Carr identifies is surely largely correct, even if it takes a decade or two for the switch to be made. We\u0026rsquo;ll still have a lot of computing cycles happening everywhere, but perhaps it may turn out to be true that the world really does need only five computers. And if there are limitations to the expansion of the megacomputers because of the complexity of computing as a utility, well there are other limits to growth (national ones, legislative ones) that electrical utilities have always faced that don\u0026rsquo;t constrain Google, Amazon and our other suppliers.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s part one. Part two is a welcome counterweight to the techno-utopian fluff put out by some prominent commentators. Carr covers the centralization of control (how mass participation ends up with just a few people getting loads o\u0026rsquo; cash), what he calls \u0026ldquo;the great unbundling\u0026rdquo; - the change from buying whole albums/newspapers to viewing individual stories and how that may affect production - and the darker side of the web: spam, identity theft, loss of privacy, and so on. Of these, the best chapter is on unbundling because it\u0026rsquo;s just not clear to me how or why that phenomenon will work itself out. The argument is that (to take newspapers as an example) when advertizers sell by the click and when content cannot be sold for its own sake, newspapers lose the ability to fund such expensive endeavours as investigative reporting and foreign news desks. Cross-subsidization of different parts of a newspaper, Carr argues, is the only way that quality content has managed to keep being produced, and once that model goes then so does the quality.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of possibile futures here, and I wish Carr\u0026rsquo;s book was twice as long so he could explore some of them more seriously. In the end, the book is a survey more than a deep investigation, but it is a survey that asks the right questions and we could use more books like this to chart, and perhaps help alter the course, of technological change and its many social impacts.\n","date":1200873844,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"6e605d04ae7c6150d4d6b8a80c33307c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-big-switcht/","publishdate":"2008-01-21T00:04:04Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-big-switcht/","section":"post","summary":"The Big Switch, by Nicholas Carr, is published by W.W.Norton, January 2008.

If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields.    McRae says that war is tragic and heroic; Owen says it is tragic and futile. McRae demands that the death of soldiers be given meaning by continuing the war that caused their death. Owen demands that we admit the meaninglessness and criminality of those deaths and prevent further ones.\nIn Canada at least, the Poppy is now inextricably tangled with the McRae vision of soldiers and warfare. Here is the Canadian Legion\u0026rsquo;s site:\nHis poem speaks of Flanders fields, but the subject is universal – the fear of the dead that they will be forgotten, that their death will have been in vain. Remembrance, as symbolized by the Poppy, is our eternal answer which belies that fear.    Now Canadian soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan while British soldiers fight in Iraq. The Poppy asks that we give meaning to the death of Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan by \u0026ldquo;Tak[ing] up our quarrel with the foe\u0026rdquo;; by pursuing the war. The Poppy has been taken over, in recent years, by those who are using it to perpetuate \u0026ldquo;The old Lie\u0026rdquo;. Jingoistic patriotism has got its grubby hands on what was once a fine symbol.\nNot everyone who wears a poppy means these things by it, of course. Many do as a recognition of the sacrifice of relatives in the second world war. I have no problem with that. It would be much simpler to reject the Poppy if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the Second World War. It was, obviously, the essential war that needed to be fought, and which did have undeniable meaning. But the Second World War was not the template for wars since then; it was the exception not the rule.\nFor me, I can\u0026rsquo;t see how I can wear a Poppy without helping to promote the idea that Canadian soldiers are fighting for just and noble causes. And I can\u0026rsquo;t do that.\nWe do have an old Alliance for Non-Violent Action button with a poppy and the words \u0026ldquo;To Remember is to End All War\u0026rdquo;.

A few questions a few people have asked me about No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart\u0026hellip;\nWhere did you get the title?\nThe title evolved along with the content of the book. I think the first version of it came from Paul Krugman\u0026rsquo;s essay Enemies of the WTO which was published in Slate on November 24, 1999. I\u0026rsquo;d admired Krugman\u0026rsquo;s writings for some time, and yet had anti-globalization leanings. The end of his essay (which I quote and misattribute on p. 190) encapsulates the challenge I wanted to address:\nAlthough they [anti-globalization protesters] talk of freedom and democracy, their key demand is that individuals be prevented from getting what they want--that governments be free, nay encouraged, to deny individuals the right to drive cars, work in offices, eat cheeseburgers, and watch satellite TV. Why? Presumably because people will really be happier if they retain their traditional \"language, dress, and values.\" Thus, Spaniards would be happier if they still dressed in black and let narrow-minded priests run their lives, and residents of the American South would be happier if planters still sipped mint juleps, wore white suits, and accepted traditional deference from sharecroppers ... instead of living in this \"dreary\" modern world in which Madrid is just like Paris and Atlanta is just like New York. Well, somehow I suspect that the residents of Madrid and Atlanta, while they may regret some loss of tradition, prefer modernity. And you know what? I think the rest of the world has the right to make the same choice.    Just before that paragraph he uses the sentence \u0026ldquo;And nobody forces you to eat at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;, which I latched onto. When I first sent the book to the publisher I took a couple of syllables out, shortening it to \u0026ldquo;No One Makes You Eat at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;.\nThe change to Wal-Mart came about for two reasons. First, the McDonald\u0026rsquo;s example turns out to be a difficult one that I only address 90% of the way through the book, and so the title didn\u0026rsquo;t match the structure of the manuscript. My Wal-Mart story had moved into Chapter 1 by that time, as the very first story in the book, and so \u0026ldquo;No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart\u0026rdquo; just made a lot more sense. Also, of course, in the years between 1999 and 2005 Wal-Mart had supplanted McDonald\u0026rsquo;s as the pre-eminent symbol of rampaging capitalism. So that decided it.\nIn retrospect: I\u0026rsquo;m pretty pleased with how the title worked out. It\u0026rsquo;s misleading because everyone thinks it\u0026rsquo;s a book about Wal-Mart and assumes it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a popular journalistic polemic, but at least it catches the attention and that\u0026rsquo;s all you can hope for.\nWhy do you call the town Whimsley?\nTo me the name is a mixture of something whimsical and something down to earth, both of which the stories are meant to be. I think the whimsical-whimsley part of that is obvious enough. The \u0026ldquo;ley\u0026rdquo; ending is a reference to the many millstone grit towns of Yorkshire that end in that syllable - Burley, Ilkley, Batley, Bramley, Barnsley and probably hundreds of others, but particularly Otley, the nearest town of any size where I grew up. There cannot be many more pragmatic, realistic places around.\nIn retrospect: I still like the name.\nWhy are the two characters called Jack and Jill?\nThese names are a reference to the R.D.Laing book Knots, which I was introduced to by either Nigel Perry or Clive Norris in 1978. It\u0026rsquo;s a quirky book that sets out patterns of tangled behaviour in short structured vignettes like this:\nJack is afraid Jill is like his mother\nJill is afraid Jack is like her mother\nJack is afraid\nJill thinks he is like her mother\nand that Jill is afraid\nJack thinks she is like his mother\nJill is afraid\nJack thinks she is like his mother\nand that Jack is afraid\nJill thinks he is like her mother\nTo tell the truth, I never really got very far with the book, slim though it is, but the recursive form of these vignettes has stayed with me. I had hoped I could make my stories condensed and elegant in the same fashion, but they ended up being more pedestrian. Ah well. (In earlier drafts the two characters were called Winston and Julia, but that is melodramatic and obvious, so it went.)\nWhy did you coin the word MarketThink?\nWas it needed? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure now. At the time it seemed important. It is close to the idea of market populism that Thomas Frank writes about so well in One Market Under God, and close to the idea of market fundamentalism, a phrase used by many people. But both of these terms convey the idea that their supporters are promoting markets as solutions to all problems. The reason I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to use those is that those who promote this loose, populist ideology do not always promote free markets - certainly not ideal competitive markets. Intellectual property is an obvious area where promoters of private industry are keen to prevent the competition they claim to believe in elsewhere. Nevertheless, the rhetoric of MarketThink portrays the world (governments aside) as if it works like an ideal competitive market, even when proposing actions that contradict that portrayal.

It\u0026rsquo;s about fifteen minutes in. Fading star Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) has won a part in a new film being directed by an unctuous Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons), and she turns up on the empty, hangar-like set to do a read-through with her co-star, the sleazy Devon Berk (Justin Theroux). From what we\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far all these characters seem shallow; caricatures of actors and directors.\nDern, Irons, and Theroux sit at a trestle table and then Irons suggests they read through a scene where Devon\u0026rsquo;s character (Billy Side) arrives home to find Nikki\u0026rsquo;s character (Susan Blue) upset. After a few awkward moments, Devon/Theroux starts reading.\nAnd everything changes.\nThe camera closes in on Dern as the two characters say their lines, quietly and intently, staring at each other, the plain dialogue punctuated by long pauses.

Billy or Devon or Justin Theroux?\n\u0026ldquo;Are you crying?\u0026rdquo; whispers Billy/Devon/Theroux.\nA long pause.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; mouths Susan/Nikki/Dern.

I\u0026rsquo;m confident that SQL Anywhere is as fast as HSQL, but you are right that you could do more with the data in an application than with simple queries like I was doing. However, in the end you have to deal with sparse matrices, and databases don\u0026rsquo;t usually store or manipulate those well.\nSomeone on reddit (can\u0026rsquo;t find the link now) posted that they have posted a C++ framework for analyzing the data set, together with one of the more popular avenues, a Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. So if you want to be able to try out algorithms that are better than Netflix\u0026rsquo; current one, then go hunt the article on reddit and you\u0026rsquo;ll find one.\nQuite a few people pointed out that just because there seem to be challenges with the Netflix Prize because of the way the data is collected doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean all recommender systems must be thrown in the bin, and I agree. Narrowing it down to one person per \u0026ldquo;customer\u0026rdquo; instead of a household would help. Other things (mood indicators, half star ratings) may make incremental improvements. But for movies, mostly watched once, there are always going to be some issues of variability. For music - and anything else where we return over and over again to something we buy or experience - rating systems have a better chance of success. Mostly we buy music we either know we like or have a good idea we will like, so we can use purchases instead of surveys as a way of tracking preferences. But movies are experience goods except for those few you may watch more than once.\nThe other main topic was people\u0026rsquo;s experience of rating systems. This seemed highly variable - some say they are useless, others that they are fine, and others that a small difference in accuracy may make a big difference. Some suggested that tracking the RMSE is not very useful - but that was Netflix\u0026rsquo;s decision, not mine.

If anyone can come up with a recommender system for predicting customer DVD preferences that beats its own algorithm (Cinematch) by a certain amount, Netflix will hand over $1million. The prize got a lot of attention because it exemplifies the idea of crowdsourcing. Not only does Netflix rely on crowdsourcing of DVD ratings (user ratings of DVD titles) but the competition itself is an attempt to use crowdsourcing to develop the algorithms to make the most of those ratings. Instead of doing the work itself, or hiring specialists, Netflix lets whoever anyone enter their competition and pays the winner. The competition is still in progress: Netflix says it will run until at least 2011. So now the initial buzz has died down, what can we learn from the Netflix Prize?\nFirst, the competition details (see here (PDF) for a short paper by two Netflix employees). Netflix made public a database of customer DVD ratings (tweaked to ensure privacy) that included over 100 million individual ratings of 17,770 titles by 480,189 people. If you sign up for the prize, you can download these ratings. Each rating involves one customer giving an integer number from one star (very bad) to five stars (very good) for a given title. For example, customer 296452 gave title 234 (\u0026ldquo;Animation Legend: Winsor McCay\u0026rdquo;) a rating of 1 (very bad).\nThe idea is that competition entrants try to develop an algorithm by using the training set (which is the 100 million plus set of ratings), try it out on a set of probe set of test data that they also give you, and once they think they have a good algorithm, create a set of predictions for a qualifying set of users and titles, and upload it to Netflix. Netflix test these predictions against the actual rankings (which they keep private) for that qualifying set. They post the leading algorithms on a leaderboard.\nThe quality of any algorithm is determined by its root mean squared error (RMSE). To calculate the RMSE you take the difference between the rating the algorithm predicts and the actual rating, and square it so it\u0026rsquo;s guaranteed to be a positive number. Then you take the average of all these over the set of data to get the mean squared error. Finally, taking the square root gives the RMSE, which is the roughly the size of a typical error.\nA perfect algorithm would predict exactly what rating every user would give to every title and would have an RMSE of zero. A random set of predictions has an RMSE of 1.95. But the actual range of action is much narrower than this 1.95 range. A simple algorithm that uses the average rating for each title as the prediction - \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s see, the average rating for the 104,000 customers who rated Mean Girls was 3.514, so I predict you will give it a rating of 3.514\u0026rdquo; - gets an RMSE of 1.0540. Netflx\u0026rsquo;s Cinematch algorithm has an RMSE of 0.9525. Netflix set the prize target at a 10% improvement over that, which is an RMSE 0.8563. So the range that recommendation systems can realistically cover - from naively simple to cutting-edge research - seems to be the narrow band between the middle three lines in the following diagram.\nIn the days and weeks after the prize was announced, progress was rapid. The Cinematch score was matched within a week. Within a month the leaders were half way to the winning prize with a 5% improvement. But getting further improvement progress has proved more and more difficult. It took another month to get to a 6% improvement, about 5 more months to get to 7%, and the current (July 29 2007) leader is at 7.8% improvement and has been unchanged for a month. Here is a graph of the progress, showing the three lines above and the prize leader progress:\nAt this stage it is not clear if the prize is winnable: the existing algorithms use a lot of linear algebra and some pretty fancy machine learning ideas (see a description by a leading participant here and some sample code for a similar approach here), the leading groups include university research labs from around the world, and many of the more obvious approaches have been explored. Certainly media and blog interest - huge in the early days - has dropped off in recent months. This New York Times article is one of the few from the last month or two.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not get into the computer science of recommender systems - there\u0026rsquo;s a good review from 2004 called Evaluating Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems here if you want to know more. Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s step back a bit and ask what this prize tells us so far, and look at a couple of things we can learn by poking around the massive data set that Netflix provided.\nOne question is: how good is an algorithm with an RMSE of 1, and is an algorithm with an RMSE of 0.8563 much better for the average customer? Actually, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s two questions. Anyway, if the errors followed a normal distribution (which they don\u0026rsquo;t, but we\u0026rsquo;re talking back-of-envelope here) then if a customer actually rated a title as 2 (poor), an algorithm with an RMSE of 1.0 would predict somewhere between 1 and 3 about 70% of the time. Not bad, but not startling. If the algorithm gave ten recommended movies, then it would get on average seven out of ten within one unit of the customer\u0026rsquo;s actual rating. Meanwhile, the RMSE=0.8563 algorithm would get 7.6 out of ten. While this is an improvement, and while it may be a remarkable technical accomplishment, it does not seem to be exactly a revolutionary leap compared to the really simple algorithms as far as customers go.\n[**Update, December 25, 2007: **Yehuda Koren of leading team KorBell approaches the recommendation problem a different way, looking at ordering of recommendations rather than at matching them. His way is more appropriate, and gives much more encouraging results. See here.]\nAs soon as you start looking at the data set it becomes obvious why it is so difficult to get good results. Databases don\u0026rsquo;t have the linear algebra and other mathematical tools for taking a run at the prize but they are convenient for exploring data sets, so I loaded the data into a SQL Anywhere database (The developer edition is a free download, and I\u0026rsquo;ll provide a perl script to load the data if you really want it) and started poking around. Here are a few of the more obvious oddities (all these observations have been posted elsewhere - see the Netflix prize forum for more):\n Customer 2170930 has rated 1963 titles and given each and every one a rating of one (very bad). You would think they would have cancelled their subscription by now.\n Five customers have rated over 10,000 of the 17,770 titles selected - and presumably they also have rated some of the others among the 60,000 or so titles Netflix had available when they released the ratings. Are these real people?\n Customer 305344 had rated 17654 titles. Even though Netflix make it easy to rate titles that you have not rented from them (so they can get a handle on your preferences) can this be real?\n Customer 1664010 rated 5446 titles in a single day (October 12, 2005).\n Customer 2270619 has rated 1975 titles. 1931 were given a 5, 31 were given a 4, 10 given a 3, 2 given a 2 (Grumpy Old Men and Sex In Chains) and a single title was given a 1. That title? Gandhi, which has an average rating of over 4 and which less than 2% of those who watch it give a 1.\n The most often rated movie? Miss Congeniality with ratings by over 232,000 of the 480,000 customers. And which title is most similar to it in terms of ratings (using a slightly weighted Pearson formula)? Bloodfist 5: Human Target.\n Most highly rated - Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (Extended Edition), with 4.7.\n  Some of the more bizarre facts above may be artifacts of whatever tweaking process Netflix put the data set through (although they claim not to have materially affected the statistics). While odd, bizarre users are not always difficult to deal with: if you have rated each of the last 1963 titles you\u0026rsquo;ve watched as 1 it is pretty easy to predict what you will rate the next title. But others are more tricky.\nOne reason for these oddities is one of the things that Evaluating Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems identifies. They note that (on other, smaller data sets) even the best algorithms don\u0026rsquo;t seem to get beyond an RMSE of 0.73 on a five-point scale, and speculate that the cause may be \u0026ldquo;natural variability\u0026rdquo;. We users provide inconsistent ratings - sometimes we\u0026rsquo;d rate a movie a 3 and sometimes a 4, with no consistency. It may depend on our mood when we watched the movie - we may give a romantic movie a higher rating if we watched it on a first date than if we watched it a week later after being left broken hearted, or a demanding movie a low rating because we were tired and out of sorts when we watched it - or it may depend on our mood when we actually provide the rating.\nThere are other, more obvious reasons which, for reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, don\u0026rsquo;t seem to get discussed much. Netflix itself and most competitors talk about the data in terms of \u0026ldquo;movies\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;users\u0026rdquo;. But the \u0026ldquo;movies\u0026rdquo; in the list are not all movies: a lot are TV series or music video collections. The variability among the episodes of a series (Do you think Lost Season 1 deserves a 3 or a 4?) must make single-number ranking even more variable and these composite DVDs figure prominently among those titles that have the biggest variance in ratings.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the fact that a customer might not really be a single person. It might be a household with several viewers in it. So perhaps one person likes Terminator, one likes Bridget Jones, and one likes Spongebob Squarepants. Once we realize that the \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; might be a collection of people there is no strangeness between giving high ratings to each of these, but you can see how, depending on which household member entered the rating, the values may be quite different (perhaps this is why titles like \u0026lsquo;N Sync: Making of the Tour, Pokemon Vol 9, and Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series Collectors\u0026rsquo; Edition have high variance - the person rating may not always have been the person who wanted to watch it). If the data set contains these inevitable variations (in addition to the plain kookiness on show in the Netflix set) then it may be that even the clevverest algorithm can make little progress in untangling all the intrinsic vagueness of the data.\nSo what I get from the Netflix prize is that there are probably significant limits to recommender systems. Even the smartest don\u0026rsquo;t do a whole lot better than the simple approaches, and a lot of work is required to eke out even a little more actual information from the morass of data. It seems surprisingly difficult to get reliable, factual information on this important question of how useful they can be. Part of the reason is that they are new - Amazon has only been in business for about ten years after all - and part of the reason is that the behaviour of these systems is often a closely guarded secret despite the aura of openness that web companies cultivate.\nThis matters because there is a surprising amount riding on the effectiveness of recommender systems. Silicon Valley\u0026rsquo;s new-economy enthusiasts see them as the key to developing a new level of cultural democracy: they see recommender systems as a trebuchet hurling rocks at the castles of the old elite of mainstream media, big publishers with big marketing departments, big-chain book stores and Hollywood sequels. Recommender systems are claimed to embody the \u0026ldquo;wisdom of crowds\u0026rdquo;. The idea is that everyone just publishes stuff (blogs, wikipedia entries and so on) and amateur readers or viewers decide what has merit by their actions (rating stories, buying and rating books and DVDs and so on). The work of critics is \u0026ldquo;crowdsourced\u0026rdquo; to customers, but it is the recommender system that distills these ratings to yield the aforementioned wisdom.\nIf faith in recommender systems is misplaced, then the new boss may look much like the old boss only with more computer hardware. There is a danger that recommender systems may simply magnify the popularity of whatever is currently hot - that they may just amplify the voice of marketing machines rather than reveal previously-hidden gems. Even worse, their presence may drive out other sources of cultural diversity (small bookstores, independent music labels, libraries) concentrating the rewards of cultural production in fewer hands than ever and leading us to a more homogeneous, winner-take-all culture.\nI\u0026rsquo;m no futurist, but I see little evidence from the first 300 days of the Netflix Prize that recommender systems are the magic ingredient that will reveal the wisdom of crowds.\n","date":1185746282,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"57d72c487b6b3bbed768256a2f69f404","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the-limitations/","publishdate":"2007-07-29T21:58:02Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-limitations/","section":"post","summary":"Today the Netflix Prize Competition has been running for 300 days.\nOnline DVD rental outfit Netflix caused a real buzz last October when it announced the competition.

The link I clicked led to a brief note here.\nAs is the way with Internet contacts I knew a few things about Dave, but almost nothing about his real life. I knew that he was a Bonsai enthusiast who had grown huge numbers of bonsai trees, and yet I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how old he was. I knew that he had been to China, but not what he looked like.\nThe other thing I know is that Dave commented on weblogs a lot (both here at Whimsley and elsewhere, at Marginal Revolution for example). Most recently we had a brief exchange in which he posted a comment last Wednesday (link) that I replied to a few days later, not having a clue of what had happened in the meantime. We disagreed - mainly over the role of multinational companies in poor countries, which he saw as overall hugely positive for the poorest people in those countries, and over the role of government - but he was unfailingly polite and thoughtful and articulate. He even offered my family the use of a cabin even though we had never met and even though I don\u0026rsquo;t know what family he has.\nSo I am in the odd position of saying that I will miss Dave, even though I hardly knew him.

Oh well, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get back to it soon. Meanwhile, here is a something a little different, which owes a lot to various posts by Chris Dillow at Stumbling and Mumbling.\nThe names of Vasili Arkhipov and Stanislav Petrov do not appear in most lists of 20th century heroes, but they should. After all, who else could claim to have literally saved the world?\nArkhipov\u0026rsquo;s moment came during the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 27, 1962, when he was an officer on a Soviet nuclear-armed submarine. When the submarine was bombarded by an American ship an intelligence officer on board thought \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s it - the end\u0026rdquo; and the captain gave the order to prepare to fire a nuclear missile. Had the missile launched, nuclear war would have begun, but firing a nuclear warhead required the approval of three officers and Arkhipov prevailed on his fellow officers to wait \u0026ndash; and things calmed down. When the story became public in 2002 Thomas Blanton, director of the US National Security Archive, said simply: \u0026ldquo;A guy called Vasili Arkhipov saved the world\u0026rdquo;.\nIn 1983, Stanislav Petrov was monitoring the Soviet early warning satellites for signs of a US attack. His instructions were clear: if he detected missiles targeting the USSR he was \u0026ldquo;to push the button and launch a counter-offensive\u0026rdquo;. But when the system showed five missile launches in the US all headed towards the USSR, sirens blared and warning lights flashed, and a room full of people waited for him to push the button, he didn\u0026rsquo;t. It didn\u0026rsquo;t look right to him and he reported the alarm to his superiors but declared it false. Petrov was right: the signal was a false alarm triggered by the satellite itself, and a war was averted.\nYou could hardly find two more unheroic heroes. They were not powerful generals or strong warriors, they were mid-level functionaries in the Soviet military: small cogs in a very big machine, far from the centres of political power. And their actions were not the decisive, bold gestures that we expect from heroes but were cautious and sceptical. When others demanded action their heroic response was to say \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s wait and see\u0026rdquo;.\nWe should value modest people such as Arkhipov and Petrov more highly. It is time for modest people to get the credit they deserve.\nLook around. It is easy to see what kind of character traits we value. We nourish \u0026ldquo;leaders\u0026rdquo; all the way from elementary school (where programs select \u0026ldquo;leaders of tomorrow\u0026rdquo;) through university scholarships and on into the adult world. We heap admiration on those who succeed in reaching positions of power. We encourage single-minded ambition with every book or show or speaker that tells you to \u0026ldquo;find your passion\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;follow your dream\u0026rdquo;. We applaud extroverts for their gregariousness and self-confidence.\nOn the other hand, we undervalue traits such as meekness, generosity, doubt, introversion, a sense of balance, gentleness, irony and competence. In short, we reward arrogance and punish modesty. (I don\u0026rsquo;t mean modesty as in women covering up their bodies so that men don\u0026rsquo;t get excited, of course, I mean modesty as in a sense of limits, lack of pretension).\nThese unbalanced values distort many aspects of our culture. Consider heroism. We search for our heroes among those who are \u0026ldquo;exceptional\u0026rdquo; (climb higher mountains, score more goals, make more money\u0026hellip;) but a different and better idea of heroism is possible, in which heroic acts are those that reveal our humanity. Arkhipov and Petrov are two examples. For another, consider the 17th century inhabitants of the village of Eyam (rhymes with dream) in Derbyshire, England. I heard of this from John Trevor\u0026rsquo;s song \u0026ldquo;Roses of Eyam\u0026rdquo;, as sung by the wonderful Roy Bailey. The song records how the villagers gave up their lives when bubonic plague arrived in Eyam by sealing themselves off to make sure the disease did not spread to the surrounding areas. The number who died varies according to the telling: some say 259 of 333, some 318 from 350, but there was no doubt that those who sealed themselves off had little chance of survival. There was nothing grandiose here - no rewards, no trophies, no immortality save of the most simple kind. And yet how much more heroic these unknown people are than, say, Bill Gates or Bono.\nJames Joyce realized that our common humanity is at the core of heroism. By building the greatest novel of the twentieth century around a day in the life of a Leopold Bloom \u0026ndash; a middle-aged, cuckolded, advertising salesman \u0026ndash; Joyce highlighted the epic nature of everyday life. And he is right; the great things in life are universal. Birth and death, giving birth, caring for others: you don\u0026rsquo;t need to explore the remote corners of the world to find these things, yet what can be greater? As Chris Dillow reminds us, Thomas Gray knew the value of modest lives. In his \u0026ldquo;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\u0026rdquo; he surveyed the graves of the \u0026ldquo;rude Forefathers\u0026rdquo; of a hamlet:\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny obscure; Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile The short and simple annals of the Poor    The poet reminds us of the importance and nobility of modest work compared to the contributions of those who enjoy \u0026ldquo;the pomp of power\u0026rdquo;. Dillow again: \u0026ldquo;All the essentials of life come from the little people who clean the streets and make our food. The humblest binman has done more good for me in the last 10 years than [Tony] Blair\u0026rsquo;s managed.\u0026rdquo; Or, as I read in a cookbook, \u0026ldquo;The discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a star\u0026rdquo;.\nWe would have better politicians and CEOs if a sense of service - an inherently modest quality - rather than \u0026ldquo;leadership quality\u0026rdquo; was seen as a character trait to be rewarded, and if they recognized that their success comes as much from luck and the quirks of history as from merit. And even those who do reach the pinnacles with good motives must be treated with suspicion. Power of all strands does, after all, corrupt, and those who see power are the most vulnerable to corruption.\nPublic discourse suffers from the same warped perspective. Those who parade bold visions and big ideas gain much of the limelight, but such efforts often have more to say about the vanity and presumption of their authors than about the reach of their intellects. A discourse based on big ideas is prone to being diverted by demagogues. Flashy writing and speaking does have its place, but mainly as popularization, and it means little if not built on cautious and detailed work carried out by those with more modest aims. The devil is often in the details and the world can more often be seen by looking closely at a grain of sand than by scanning the far horizon.\nVanity is linked to what must be The Word For 2007: \u0026ldquo;passionate\u0026rdquo;. At every turn it seems that we are told that the way to happiness is to \u0026ldquo;find your passion\u0026rdquo;. Companies boast that they have a \u0026ldquo;passion for excellence\u0026rdquo;. Be all you can be. Follow your dream.\nSuch ideas are literally self-centred, and are the opposite of the modest life. When you are the star of your own life, those around you are reduced to supporting roles. Who, I cannot help but wonder, is paying for that dream? Who is finding the children\u0026rsquo;s clothes while you are busy finding your passion? Usually it is the family members who have to suffer the absences (physical and mental) of the dreamer. Conor Cruise O\u0026rsquo;Brien has been called \u0026ldquo;the greatest living Irishman\u0026rdquo;, yet in a trip to Toronto in the 1990s he was without his family for once, and he was at a loss. Why? Because his family members usually handled the money, the arrangements, the mundane details of his trips. Surely no one who gets those around him to do the drudge work can be considered \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo;.\nPassion not only leads to a self-centred life; it is also the enemy of scepticism, of doubt, and of reflection. To be passionate is to be blinkered. Evangelists, monomaniacs, and demagogues are as passionate as anyone, and follow their dream wherever it takes them. But they are terrible role models. We would do better to emulate those who make and accept the compromises of a modest life; those who treat people around them with respect, who accept that others have dreams too and that, if we all give a little, we may not reach our dream but we may have a better world.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that we should cast down the extrovert and immodest. Every parade needs a leader and, as the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t lead a parade if you think you look funny sitting on a horse\u0026rdquo;. Movies need stars and some rock bands benefit from a little swagger, but the point is that the starring role, while it grabs the spotlight, is just one of many that combine to produce the finished event. The star cannot shine without a supporting cast. Every great band needs its rhythm section, every orchestra its second fiddles. No politician gets elected without dedicated campaign workers and no matter how comfortable you feel on a horse, you can\u0026rsquo;t lead a parade all on your own because that\u0026rsquo;s not a parade. We need to remember that music, parades, and other events are collective efforts, and value those who feel more comfortable behind the scenes together with those who revel in the spotlight.\nOf all roles, perhaps that of the spectator is least appreciated. Being a spectator is seen as passive and uninspired: how often do you hear the phrase \u0026ldquo;mere spectator\u0026rdquo; contrasted with \u0026ldquo;active participant\u0026rdquo;? Yet us spectators have an essential part to play too, because great events are made great by their spectators. What is a cup final without the fans? A rock concert without the crowd? A festival without the festival-goers? Or consider books: novelist Zadie Smith recently wrote that \u0026ldquo;A novel is a two-way street, in which the labour required on either side is, in the end, equal\u0026hellip; Reading is a skill and an art and readers should take pride in their abilities and have no shame in cultivating them if for no other reason than the fact that writers need you\u0026rdquo;.\nExtroverts, as Jonathan Rauch says in a widely-read essay, dominate public life. \u0026ldquo;This is a pity\u0026rdquo;, he goes on, \u0026ldquo;If introverts ran the world, it would no doubt be a calmer, saner, more peaceful sort of place.\u0026rdquo; Yet introverts get little respect:\nExtroverts are seen as bighearted, vibrant, warm, empathic. \"People person\" is a compliment. Introverts are described with words like \"guarded\", \"loner\", \"reserved\", \"taciturn\", \"self-contained\", \"private\" - narrow, ungenerous words.    There are good reasons for this. Extroverts, after all, are in a good position to spread the idea that being outgoing is a good thing. Introverts, on the other hand, are not well suited to evangelize the virtues of quiet.\nRestoring a balance will not be easy, because it demands immodest behaviour of modest people. It is difficult to promote the quiet virtues in a world drowning in the verbiage of the loudmouthed. Does it even make sense to stage an outspoken demand for modesty (if that\u0026rsquo;s all right with you?), a brash call for humility, a blunt demand for subtlety, an uncompromising plea for flexibility? Can we be unequivocally on the side of doubt? Does it make sense to spout a monologue on the benefits of shutting the hell up?\nProbably not. The very idea of a manifesto is, of course, immodest. But I think it could be saved by something that is lacking in this attempt, which is irony. Perhaps someone else can do a better job.\nWe should be able to speak up while accepting the limits of our own arguments if we acknowledge (with Leonard Cohen) that \u0026ldquo;there is a crack in everything. That\u0026rsquo;s how the light gets in.\u0026rdquo; Contradiction is an opportunity to learn rather than a debate to be fought. Thesis and antithesis are the beginning of synthesis. In exploring both sides of contradictions and arguments we learn to see both sides of a dispute, empathize with hurts and griefs that are not our own, and start to see the cracks in our own beliefs. And that must surely be a goal of any modest agenda - although not before we get the immodest down off their high horses and get them to shut up for a minute.\n","date":1184457479,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"80a283c8d5486d571b0a708d62c57a88","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/if-thats-all-ri/","publishdate":"2007-07-14T23:57:59Z","relpermalink":"/post/if-thats-all-ri/","section":"post","summary":"My \u0026ldquo;Happy Shoes\u0026rdquo; series seems to have faded out one episode before I meant it to.

The primary barrier to establishing fair trade is reliable information about production conditions, not the ethical standards of those in the boardrooms. When individual consumers cannot verify ethical production and when even well-meaning companies cannot prove that they are walking the walk, the outcome is as if we didn\u0026rsquo;t care about ethical production at all. In the absence of reliable information ethical companies are punished; in the presence of reliable information even scummy companies may find it worth their while to behave ethically.\nSo how do we get reliable information? One thing is for certain: as individual consumers we are not going to collect that information ourselves. It costs a lot more than the $20 premium our archetypal consumer is prepared to pay to verify factory conditions in Bangladesh.\nFree-market enthusiasts says that self reporting and brand reputation will do the trick, because brands tell consumers what the company stands for (essentially the Potter \u0026amp; Heath argument I quoted in Happy Shoes I). But brands are cheap talk: smart consumers know that for every company claiming to stand for decency that actually does the right thing, there\u0026rsquo;s another one mouthing the words while screwing its employees, and that we can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference. What a company says about its own behaviour is inherently untrustworthy - it has too many reasons to bend the truth. That\u0026rsquo;s obviously why voluntary \u0026ldquo;codes of practice\u0026rdquo; have been taken with such a big shovel of salt (two examples: see Charles Fishman on Wal-Mart here, or the Nike Andrew Young affair from a few years ago). That\u0026rsquo;s not cynicism, that\u0026rsquo;s realism.\nNevertheless, many kinds of verification bodies have appeared to put varying degrees of teeth into the codes, from the use of professional auditors (Ernst \u0026amp; Young for example) to industry self-government bodies (the Fair Labor Association in the USA) to independent specialist groups (Verite being an example) to bodies with roots in activism (Workers\u0026rsquo; Rights Consortium). Some monitor, some provide complaint-handling mechanisms as an alternative.\nBut there are incentives at work for these monitoring bodies too. There are incentives for those paid by the companies to develop a collusive relationship over time; those acting on behalf of activist may have incentives to exaggerate. More ambiguity and puzzlement.\nAnd what\u0026rsquo;s more, the variety of verifiers is matched by the variety of possible criteria for \u0026ldquo;ethics\u0026rdquo;. Ethical production is not, after all, an all-or-nothing affair. Wages, rights, conditions, harassment, broken employment contracts and so on are all issues that come into play.\nIn the face of all this complexity (which will differ from product to product, market to market) is there anything general that we can say? Obviously the specifics of each case are of overriding importance - and you should look elsewhere for them - but perhaps we can get just a little something out of simplistic thinking.\nInformation about production is a public good. Consumers are in a particularly bad place when it comes to producing such public goods for a few reasons: we cannot easily cooperate with other consumers because shopping is such an individual act, we are a heterogeneous bunch with differing preferences, and we live in many different places, each of which makes it more difficult to coordinate our actions.\nIt is no surprise, then, that the biggest successes of the anti-sweatshop movement came at universities, and in particular from student activists putting pressure on the production of university-branded goods. First, university students are a relatively homogeneous crowd. Second, they are all lumped together on campus, so there is a lot of peer pressure over who wears what. Third, they can influence production not just as consumers at the till of the university store, but as students who have a voice in university governance. The fact that the Collegiate Licensing Company was agent for 160 universities provides a focus for political pressure across campuses, and one with enough clout to transmit that pressure to the producers. So political action becomes the mechanism for collectively expressing individual consumer preferences for ethical production.\nSeen in this light, rag-tag groups of black-clad, drum-pounding anarchists are performing a role not too different to that of consumer magazines. They are highlighting the information needed to enable consumers to make better choices, and to help markets function better. Not a role they would identify with, perhaps,but a useful one nonetheless.\nOne thing about information is that it may cost a lot to find it out, but it can then be easily made available to many people. The codes and practices adopted as a result of activist pressure have been used in the wider marketplace as a way for other consumers to identify ethically-produced goods, and giving companies prepared to make such a commitment a chance to make money off it.\nWe get to free-ride off the efforts of activists but this is not, I guess, a form of free-riding they would object to.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one other thing I think can be said from simple thinking about information, but I\u0026rsquo;ll save it for tomorrow (or so).\n","date":1183675331,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"c5bf8552203c3c014382ca000a6a2627","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/happy-shoes-iv/","publishdate":"2007-07-05T22:42:11Z","relpermalink":"/post/happy-shoes-iv/","section":"post","summary":"In Happy Shoes II I argued that if the market is left to isolated consumers and companies, the prospects for ethical consumption are bleak.

But all the useful action in credence goods - whether it is the kosher certification market or fair trade labelling organizations or trade restrictions - happens because of groups other than the usual competitive market actors.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tHappy Shoes III - A few references\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"At the end of the previous post it looked as if, so long as enough consumers are prepared to pay a premium for ethically-produced goods, Happy Shoes should be able to make a profit, pay its workers better than Sweatshoes, and satisfy customers all at the same time.\nBut \u0026ndash; contrary to what Potter \u0026amp; Heath claim \u0026ndash; it is difficult for companies to make money by selling \u0026ldquo;shoes made by happy workers\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;ethical production\u0026rdquo; is a credence good. When you buy shoes, you can tell if your new shoes fit well, you can tell what they are made of, and you can tell whether you like the style. But you can\u0026rsquo;t tell what the person making them got paid. Like the benefits of fluoridated toothpaste and organically-grown vegetables, it\u0026rsquo;s something you basically have to take on trust.\nThis lack of information provides an opening for unscrupulous vendors. To understand this market we have to think not only about Sweatshoes offering their $100 shoes and about Happy Shoes offering their $120 pair, but also about a third company. \u0026ldquo;Ethical Feet\u0026rdquo; comes to town with some fine-sounding words about their commitment to fairness and decency, offering to sell you an ethically made pair of shoes for $115 \u0026ndash; $5 less than Happy Shoes. It sounds like a good deal \u0026ndash; the benefit of ethical consumption, and an extra $5 left in your pocket.\nBut the difference is that Ethical Feet doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually pass on any of the extra $15 you pay to the people making the shoes. It just keeps your money. Ethical Feet would sell the shoes cheaper than Happy Shoes, but make more profit \u0026ndash; $25 profit per pair rather than $20.\nIt looks like Ethical Feet may drive Happy Shoes out of business by making unverifiable false promises, but the story does not stop here. This is not a tale of corporate trickery and consumer stupidity. As George Akerlof writes: this problem of trust is \u0026ldquo;as old as markets themselves. It concerns how horse traders respond to the natural question: \u0026ldquo;if he wants to sell that horse, do I really want to buy it?\u0026rdquo;\nSmart consumers who are prepared to pay more for ethically produced goods are still not prepared to be suckers. We are not going to pay $115 or even $120 for a pair of shoes just because a company says they are made by happy workers \u0026ndash; a claim we cannot verify. In a market of smart consumers wanting to buy shoes made by happy people, the $115 Ethical Feet shoes _and the $120 Happy Shoes _- stay on the shelf. As consumers we can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference between Ethical Feet and Happy Shoes, and we know that a company that carried out its promises is vulnerable to unscrupulous competition.\nThe company that stays in business is Sweatshoes. It pays cheaply and sells cheaply, and as consumers we pay $100. We may not feel good about this, but at least we are not being tricked. The end result is just the same as if we didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the salaries at all. As consumers, it seems we are not sovereign when it comes to ethical production.\nThe next post will probably deal with ways around this problem.\n","date":1183464372,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"81e93ef01b7002316f0dcda504fdc132","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/happy-shoes-ii/","publishdate":"2007-07-03T12:06:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/happy-shoes-ii/","section":"post","summary":"At the end of the previous post it looked as if, so long as enough consumers are prepared to pay a premium for ethically-produced goods, Happy Shoes should be able to make a profit, pay its workers better than Sweatshoes, and satisfy customers all at the same time.\nBut \u0026ndash; contrary to what Potter \u0026amp; Heath claim \u0026ndash; it is difficult for companies to make money by selling \u0026ldquo;shoes made by happy workers\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;ethical production\u0026rdquo; is a credence good.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tHappy Shoes II\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is the first in a meandering, loosely-related series of posts about consumer activism. I haven\u0026rsquo;t worked things out to the end so I won\u0026rsquo;t say where I think it\u0026rsquo;s going, and the series may fizzle out but this is, after all, just a blog - and a slow-moving occasional one at that.\nHere is a quotation from Andrew Potter and Joseph Heath\u0026rsquo;s book The Rebel Sell (based on a provocative 2002 This Magazine article you can find here ):\nIf consumers are willing to pay more for shoes made by happy workers -- or for eggs laid by happy chickens -- then there is money to be made in bringing these goods to market. It's a business model that has already been successfully exploited to great effect by The Body Shop and Starbucks, among others. [p2]    True, or not?\nHere is how it is supposed to work. Suppose you want to buy a pair of shoes and you only have one choice \u0026ndash; the only shoes available are from Sweatshoes Inc. , which makes their shoes in a sweatshop, pays their employees very little, sells shoes for $100, and makes a profit of $10. You buy them because you need shoes.\nAlong comes Happy Shoes, which makes shoes \u0026ldquo;ethically\u0026rdquo; and pays their employees better. Because you are a decent person, you\u0026rsquo;re willing to pay an extra $20 for an ethically-produced pair from Happy Shoes.\nHappy Shoes could pay its employees $10 more than Sweatshoes pays theirs, sell you the shoes for $120, and still collect a hefty $20 profit. The Happy Shoes employees are happy because they get paid more, the Happy Shoes customers are happy because they have got their ethical shoes at a price they\u0026rsquo;re prepared to pay, and Happy Shoes shareholders are happy because they have made $20 profit rather than $10. Everyone is better off if you buy Happy Shoes, except for Sweatshoes - and good riddance to them.\nThere have been some successes for ethical consumer products. Ben and Jerry\u0026rsquo;s ice cream and The Body Shop were long-time standard bearers of companies that have traded on their ethically-spotless image. Smaller businesses that sell organic foods or village-produced trinkets do the same. Even Adbusters has got into the buying and selling game with their Blackspot shoes. It\u0026rsquo;s an appealing idea: replace the moustache-twirling, cigar-smoking sweatshop-runners with enlightened and decent people, and you can change the world.\nBut after a decade or so of consumer activism the successes are still few and far between. As Bill McKibben writes in the November 2006 Mother Jones:\n   Ben and Jerry didn't change the way Haagen and Dazs viewed the world. Somehow, Bounty has been willing to leave the thoughtful paper towel market to Seventh Generation. For several decades now, environmentalists have been citing the work of [Ray Anderson](http://www.interfaceinc.com/who/founder.html) and Interface, and it's a great example -- but why is there still only one Ray Anderson?    When it comes to actually putting down cash, are we not prepared to pay the additional money for Happy Shoes? That\u0026rsquo;s the next post.\n","date":1183379239,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"034a1b0507e99a6df60ed45ffc584109","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/happy-shoes/","publishdate":"2007-07-02T12:27:19Z","relpermalink":"/post/happy-shoes/","section":"post","summary":"This is the first in a meandering, loosely-related series of posts about consumer activism.

There’s now a good case that they are quite big, and getting bigger.     This doesn’t mean that I’m endorsing protectionism. It does mean that free-traders need better answers to the anxieties of those who are likely to end up on the losing side from globalisation.    This from the man who wrote some of the most persuasive pro-free-trade essays of the 1990s. He describes the change as a change in the world (specifically, China being bigger than Korea) rather than a change in his position, but it made me wonder what\u0026rsquo;s going on\u0026hellip;\nNow today I see some responses from other professional economists:\nBrad DeLong finds himself skeptical of Krugman\u0026rsquo;s argument.\nDani Rodrik is moderately pro-Krugman.\nTyler Cowen thinks DeLong is on the right track.\nWill Wilkinson of the Cato Institute disagrees with Krugman.\nNow all these folks are experts, while I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know a Heckscher-Ohlin model if it jumped up and hit me in the nose, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help notice that they pretty much all adopt the side you\u0026rsquo;d expect them to. Krugman has been switching away from the kind of pro-free-trade view he used to endorse steadily. Cowen and Wilkinson are pro-free-trade, libertarian enthusiasts. Rodrik is a long-time sceptic (or skeptic, depending on where you come from). DeLong could have gone either way, because he leans leftwards politically but is very committed to standard economics as a way of looking at the world - the economist has won out this time.\nCan we believe that these experts have taken a dispassionate look at the situation and have coincidentally come to conclusions that line up with their politics? It\u0026rsquo;s just not plausible.Are they just using their economic expertise as a cover for their prejudices? I\u0026rsquo;ve read enough of most of them (Wilkinson aside) that I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. So how come their politics and expertise line up so nicely?\nOpinions - even expert opinions - are like magnetism, in that they exhibit hysteresis. Here\u0026rsquo;s a graph:\n\nThe X axis is the applied field, and the Y axis is magnetization. Take an unmagnetized needle and apply a magnetic field to it, and sooner or later the needle becomes magnetized (goes up the right-hand curve to the high point on the top right). But take away that field and the needle does not revert to its nonmagnetic state. It stays trapped, with all its dipoles lined up, along the top line. You have to apply a significant field in the other direction to get it to demagnetize (go down to the bottom line at the lower left). The magnetization over-shoots. It switches between two relatively stable states, and the state its in depends on its history.\nA lot of things behave like this, and opinions are one of them. We all have pre-formed opinions - imagine the bottom of the graph is \u0026ldquo;free trade is good\u0026rdquo;. If we accumulate evidence that leads us to change our mind we move to the top \u0026ldquo;free trade is not so good\u0026rdquo; line. Now suppose we hear some more evidence that pushes us the other way - do we switch back right away? No, we hang on to our existing beliefs until the weight of evidence becomes unavoidable. Switching basic views is a big thing, and we can\u0026rsquo;t be forever changing back and forth.\nIn the middle of the graph, a free trader and a non-free-trader can both look at new evidence without changing their mind. Neither is being dishonest (well, they might be, but they don\u0026rsquo;t need to be) but both look at the evidence and says \u0026ldquo;is this enough to make me change my mind?\u0026rdquo; and conclude \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\nKrugman\u0026rsquo;s writing for the New York Times over the last several years have shown, in addition to a consistent and admirable articulation of the million ways the Bush administration has screwed people around, an increasing scepticism that the free market will solve our problems. He\u0026rsquo;s made the switch from one level to another, and his view is coloured by where he sits now ( public intellectual) just as it used to be coloured by his position in the professional economist culture.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve thought of this graph a lot in the last few years. It applies to trust, our opinion of others (who do you give a break to, and who don\u0026rsquo;t you) our political views, and so on. I think it explains why experts disagree - and why those of us watching experts debate from the sidelines won\u0026rsquo;t often change our minds either.\n","date":1182038267,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"087ffdb7ff410fe5c31124d21c067230","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/watching_the_ec/","publishdate":"2007-06-16T23:57:47Z","relpermalink":"/post/watching_the_ec/","section":"post","summary":"Yesterday I read that Paul Krugman has a lot more time for opponents of free trade than he used to:\nIt’s no longer safe to assert, as we could a dozen years ago, that the effects of trade on income distribution in wealthy countries are fairly minor.

From being a witty journalist at the interesting This Magazine he now fits right in at the boring Wired Magazine. On the way he seems to have lost his sense of irony (maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t let you bring irony into Silicon Valley?) and his cynicism. As a result, he has also lost the plot. Come back Mr. Thompson!\nHis March 2007 article in Wired Magazine called The See-Through CEO coined the phrase Radical Transparency. Like other Silicon Valley catch phrases, it has that air of youthful rebellion, it is self-consciously ignorant of history (who needs history when all the interesting things are happening right now), and - most important of all - it imparts a feel-good sense of anti-corporate attitude to your next venture funding proposal or business plan. Because like other Silicon Valley catch phrases, Radical Transparency has about as much to do with rebellion as riding a mountain bike.\nHere are some snatches from the article, and some recent events in the real world, mainly as reported by The Register - which has thankfully managed to keep its senses of both irony and cynicism - and mainly about Web 2.0 poster-offspring Google and its growing Google-hoard of companies.\n**\"**You can't hide anything anymore,\" Don Tapscott says. Coauthor of _The Naked Corporation_, a book about corporate transparency, and _Wikinomics_, Tapscott is explaining a core truth of the see-through age: If you engage in corporate flimflam, people will find out.    Meanwhile, Google plays cat and mouse with regulators. Leif Aanensen, deputy director general of the Norwegian Office of the Data Inspectorate, has been investigating Google\u0026rsquo;s data retention policy:\n\"We are not satisfied,\" he said. \"We didn't get the proper answers.\"   \"Our main issue was their data retention policy and the use of the data they stored. We asked them what they were doing with the personal data - are you creating profiles - they didn't answer,\" he said.    Thompson writes: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t go halfway naked. It\u0026rsquo;s all or nothing. Executives who promise they\u0026rsquo;ll be open have to stay open.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, Google - who make repeated references to their own \u0026ldquo;radical transparency\u0026rdquo; - are closed-mouth about the introduction of new programs.\nPaying select few video producers for example:\nYouTube says anyone who wants to get paid can let it know by registering an interest, but provided no timescale for when it will cough up, or what the carve-up will be.    Or will there be advertising on the iGoogle front pages?\nThe company has not made any noises about placing personalised ads on the new iGoogle personalised homepage, but industry observers are fairly confident it is only a matter of time.    When it comes to openness, Thompson writes \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s no use trying to resist. You\u0026rsquo;re already naked.\u0026rdquo; How Naked? Hard to tell, because it is not easy to find out what information Google keeps about you.\n\"Upon arriving at the Google homepage, a Google user is not informed of Google's data collection practices until he or she clicks through four links,\" says the section of the complaint which details Google's alleged deceptive trade practices. \"Most users will not reach this page. In truth and in fact, Google collects user search terms in connection with his or her IP address without adequate notice to the user. Therefore, Google's representations concerning its data retention practices were, and are, deceptive practices.   \"As a result of Google's failure to detail its data retention policies until four levels down within its website, its users are unaware that their activities are being monitored,\" says the complaint in the section alleging unfair trade practices.    Thompson writes:\nSecrecy is dying. It's probably already dead.    Meanwhile, here\u0026rsquo;s Google being radically opaque:\nord broke this month that Google has purchased 800 acres of land in Pryor, Oklahoma. The company has yet to confirm plans for the site, but I'm betting on a new data center rather than an amusement park (in all fairness, you can never tell with this bunch – Ed).     Oklahoma proves a handy spot to have a data center since the state's Governor signed a new law that affords the largest corporate energy users the right to keep their power consumption figures a secret.   Governor Brad Henry signed the energy law (House Bill 1038) just a couple of days after news of Google's land purchase reached the local newspapers. Coincidence? Sure.   The lawmakers behind the bill denied having chats with Google around any legislation. People familiar with the matter, however, did note that the law proves convenient for an entity such as Google that likes to keep as much information secret as possible.   If you're a demanding type who needs evidence of Google's secret ways, have a listen to head of strategic development Rhett Weiss. He presided over a party celebrating yet another Google data center in South Carolina. When asked about Google's water and power usage, Weiss [confessed](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/the_real_web_20.php): \"We're in a highly competitive industry and, frankly, one or two little pieces of information like that in the hands of our competitors can do us considerable damage. So we can't discuss it.\"    What else does Google not tell us? Here\u0026rsquo;s Nicholas Carr:\n“We never,” says a Google representative, “comment on who we’re talking to, who we’ve considered, who we’ve rejected. We feel that when we come to an agreement, that’s the time to make an announcement.”    So please, Mr. Thompson - exercise some scepticism. Even a little would go a long way.\n","date":1180103860,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d1bab2e6ad134a1dce818be631df7886","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/believe_the_opp/","publishdate":"2007-05-25T14:37:40Z","relpermalink":"/post/believe_the_opp/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m afraid Clive Thompson has jumped the shark.

Very nice. But coming from his libertarian point of view, it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising he has some criticisms. Let\u0026rsquo;s skip right past the lesser ones to the Most Serious Of All:\nThe chapter on power is terrible, I did throw the book against the wall. Perhaps in order to prepare us to welcome government as the deliverer of our true preferences, Slee wants to diminish the distinction between liberty and coercion. But a true liberal should never write things like this:   ...the formal structure of democracy and free markets is not enough to rule out exploitation and plunder - characteristics usually associated with repressive regimes.      If Tom visits GMU (I happen to know he reads MR) he should watch out because I shall kick him in the shins stating, \"I refute you thus.\"     More seriously, repressive governments around the world threaten, rob, torture and murder with impunity. Courageous individuals have died trying to escape such regimes while others have died fighting for their rights. No matter how great are differences in wealth, it is morally wrong to equate what goes on in repressive regimes with capitalist acts between consenting adults.    Strong stuff, and it hits home because I always thought that chapter to be the weakest in the book. But blogs are no place for mild-mannered agreement so let me try to return the kick in the shins.\nMost of us see many problems of this world in shades of grey, but there are always a few issues that are starker and more elemental, which we see as black or white. The \u0026ldquo;shades of grey\u0026rdquo; issues are questions of nuance and detail - these are questions where reasonable people can reasonably disagree, where we look to modest reform to improve matters, and where we look for technical solutions. It\u0026rsquo;s the dichotomies where we stand our ground - these are the things that define our politics; they are matters of principle - it\u0026rsquo;s right vs. wrong and communication across these divides is difficult. So what are these fundamental, black vs white issues?\nKarl Marx knew what he thought was fundamental:\nThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.    My brother once relayed to me a very short conversation he had in a pub with a radical feminist:\nBrother: throughout history the fundamental oppression is that of one class by another. Feminist: throughout history the fundamental oppression is that of women by men. Imagined Next Line By Both: who else can I sit with?    Peter Singer (in \u0026ldquo;A Darwinian Left\u0026rdquo;, page 8) sets out what he sees as \u0026ldquo;fundamental to the left\u0026rdquo;: it is to be \u0026ldquo;on the side of the weak, not the powerful; of the oppressed, not the oppressor; of the ridden, not the rider.\u0026rdquo;\nWhere do libertarians draw their line? It\u0026rsquo;s coercion versus liberty: the state versus markets, laws versus bargains. That\u0026rsquo;s why a typical Cato Institute article is something like \u0026ldquo;Is the Minimum Wage Coercive?\u0026rdquo; Small wonder then, that it\u0026rsquo;s a chapter setting out to recast this dichotomy as shades of grey that makes Alex Tabarrok throw the book against the wall. You can see elsewhere in Alex\u0026rsquo;s review that this is the fundamental dichotomy he has in mind as he reads. When I talk about collective action he assumes I\u0026rsquo;m talking about government intervention in the economy because that\u0026rsquo;s where he sees me, as his ideological opposition, coming from.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a mark of the success of the libertarian project that the left has bought into this false dichotomy of state versus markets. We (the left) are the victim of our own success - the post-war construction of the welfare state, the achievements of social democracy, the provision of public education, and of public healthcare. We\u0026rsquo;ve let ourselves be identified with these achievements, and so now stand as conservative defenders of the state against the market-favouring radicals. Yet things need not be so. I look on my bookshelves and see some books from the UK of the late \u0026lsquo;70s and early \u0026lsquo;80s: \u0026ldquo;In and Against the State\u0026rdquo;, Ralph Miliband\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The State in Capitalist Society\u0026rdquo; and so on. Those on the left have a long history of opposition to the state, and a recognition of its problems. The difference is, we on the left don\u0026rsquo;t see the state as the root of the problems. The state may be a hammer, but it\u0026rsquo;s the arm holding it we need to worry about. \u0026ldquo;The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t it?.\nThe point of my chapter is to remind us that the state is not the sole source of coercion, and that libertarians have a blind spot to coercion in the non-state sector. In the comments section of a recent Marginal Revolution post about the Cato Institute Minimum Wage article I said \u0026ldquo;_My employer requires that I follow instructions from my manager or I can be fired. Is that also coercive? Yes.\u0026rdquo; _and another commenter responded _\u0026rdquo;_No, refusing to buy future labor from you is not coercive.\u0026rdquo; I can see what he or she means, but you can also see the false dichotomy here - the law is coercive, everything else is a matter of choice. Tell that to (among many many examples) workers locked-in overnight at Wal-Mart stores. Was slavery coercion? Yes, and it would surely be a stretch to see slavery as a problem rooted in the state.\nAlex writes \u0026ldquo;If there were no asymmetric information, no herding, no coordination problems and so forth I guarantee that there would still be plenty of inequality.\u0026rdquo; True enough, but if there were no state, no laws, no public health standards, and so forth I guarantee that there would still be plenty of coercion.\nWe are obviously speaking from very different points of view. Are there paths across the divide? I would suggest there are. Alex claims that I have \u0026ldquo;no appreciation that what some of us MarketThink people really advocate is civil society which includes non-profits and voluntary collective action of all kinds.\u0026rdquo; Compare that assertion with Erik Olin Wright\u0026rsquo;s rather wordy but still worth reading \u0026ldquo;Taking the Social in Socialism Seriously\u0026rdquo; (PDF), which also focuses on civil society as a way out of the market/state dichotomy. Or the way in which both communitarian left and libertarian right took Jane Jacobs to their hearts. There is a phrase there (voluntary collective action) that we all seem to favour, even as some of us focus on the collective and others on the voluntary. Perhaps a focus on the possibilities of that phrase would be worth exploring.\n**Update: **Brad DeLong links to AT\u0026rsquo;s review here (but credits the review to AT\u0026rsquo;s partner in marginal crime Tyler Cowen).

The results so far are online at http://www.kwndp.ca. In getting this far I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a whole lot of new words and been hugely impressed by some of the software that is now available. It\u0026rsquo;s a new world out there kids. But of course, being also technosceptical, I have some second thoughts.\nFirst things first. I am lazy of course, so I wanted to make sure that not every change to the web site had to go through me. Also, I wanted a system where members can log in, so a database-hosted site of some kind made sense. I found and went with a content-management system called drupal. To see whether this is widely used I did a google trends search and it seems like quite the thing these days, although not quite so much as its newer offspring joomla (google trends comparison here). I went with drupal because it seems a little more open, if a little less user friendly. It’s a PHP package that is usually hosted on a MySQL server using the MyISAM storage engine.\nThere’s quite a lot of install assistance for drupal. Basically, the ISP provides me with an empty MySQL database on their server, and an admin login to that database. I used filezilla to ftp the files to the ISP server, PuTTY to get a secure command line interface, and followed the instructions. After one misstep, which turned a ten minute process into an hour, I was able to open a browser, point it at the domain name, log in using the admin password my ISP had provided, and there was a drupal home page with items to create accounts and add content. From here on, pretty much everything is done by browser.\nThere’s a drupal cookbook for beginners which walks you through making some sensible settings. You can add menus to each page, allow comments on pages (like the online documentation initiative), add different content types (individual pages, “books” which have several pages of related content, and so on). You can also create users and define roles, so that visitors (external users of the site) see a web site, but users who log in can (depending on what role I give them) can create content or carry out other tasks. So I think drupal does the trick in allowing me to be lazy, while keeping the site secure.\nThere are two ways of extending a web site set up with drupal. One is themes - page layouts and colours. I’m just starting to customize our site so it has a theme that reflects the organization. The nice thing is that you can submit themes back to drupal or share them with other sites, so riding associations in other cities could, if they like the look of the KW site, adopt it too.\nThe second is modules, which are add-on packages. Some are simple, like providing a contact form.\nI haven’t seen wiki modules, but there are blogging modules so we could host a candidate’s blog during the election campaign, and forum modules (internal or external discussions).\nOther modules are complete applications in themselves. For example, I came across something called CiviCRM, which is a “constituent relationship management” package for community groups. It helps to manage volunteers, fundraising and other campaigns. So maybe the web site can be not just a public face for the riding association, but it can also serve (once people log in and once I assign them to a role that has the right privileges) as a tool for managing membership, election campaigns (who has signs on their lawns and so on) and all that. I’m just starting to look into it, but it looks pretty cool and extensive. It installs as a drupal module, so it should just add to the site I already have.\nAnd all this drupal infrastructure (as you can see from the google trends page) has been built in the last three or four years. Remarkable.\nSo I’m very impressed and pretty excited about doing more with this. Why only two cheers then?\nMainly because, if effective technology is what makes community groups and other volunteer-driven groups effective, we should be living in a golden age of participatory democracy, where larger numbers of people than ever are able to take part in everything from supporting their local orchestra to global projects. And while my friend Ruth disagrees, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we are. Participation in politics (as seen by voting rates and party memberships) is down across the board, I think, compared to a few decades ago; protests against the Iraq war have been, those big ones in 203 excepted, muted compared to previous wars. There\u0026rsquo;s a disconnect.\nTechnology is fine, but we should remember that it\u0026rsquo;s just one piece of the puzzle. So while an e-mail blast automated from a server is much more efficient than afternoons spent licking envelopes in a church basement or the constituency party rooms, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily free volunteers up to do other things. My own suspicion is because the social aspect of being in an activist group is essential to people, and while licking stamps may not be that thrilling (Principal Skinner\u0026rsquo;s opinion notwithstanding, if you remember the Simpson\u0026rsquo;s episode about the chocolate factory visit), the opportunity to hang out with other group members for an afternoon is part of what we join groups for.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll carry on with the site, and enjoy doing it. But I won\u0026rsquo;t kid myself that the success or failure of the site has much to do with the success or failure of the NDP.\n","date":1178281432,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5250249f1c169083309123063ae3afc3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/two_cheers_for_/","publishdate":"2007-05-04T12:23:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/two_cheers_for_/","section":"post","summary":"Being a little technosmug I recently volunteered to revive the website for the Kitchener-Waterloo NDP.

A few are heroes, a few take to corruption and power like a duck to water, and most of us, as in all walks of life, muddle along trying to do the right thing, compromised by our own lack of courage. The tragic fact is that in war people of all stripes do terrible things, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter a damn what their personal morals are. There is no difference between shot by a bad guy and being shot by shot by a good guy in a bad situation. The recent death of Kurt Vonnegut, haunted by the allied bombing of Dresden where he was a prisoner of war, is a reminder of that.\nWente and others who support this war sympathise with Canadians who can\u0026rsquo;t tell a good Afghan from a bad Afghan, but fail to sympathise with Afghans who don\u0026rsquo;t distinguish torturers from the troops who capture them and hand them over.

If it\u0026rsquo;s the latter, then it becomes impossible to predict at some point.

Maybe our preferences are just too damn quirky to be captured, no matter how fancy the algorithm.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a few paragraphs from the article.\nConventional marketing wisdom holds that predicting success in cultural markets is mostly a matter of anticipating the preferences of the millions of individual people who participate in them. From this common-sense observation, it follows that if the experts could only figure out what it was about, say, the music, songwriting and packaging of Norah Jones that appealed to so many fans, they ought to be able to replicate it at will. And indeed that’s pretty much what they try to do. That they fail so frequently implies either that they aren’t studying their own successes carefully enough or that they are not paying sufficiently close attention to the changing preferences of their audience.     The common-sense view, however, makes a big assumption: that when people make decisions about what they like, they do so independently of one another. But people almost never make decisions independently — in part because the world abounds with so many choices that we have little hope of ever finding what we want on our own; in part because we are never really sure what we want anyway; and in part because what we often want is not so much to experience the “best” of everything as it is to experience the same things as other people and thereby also experience the benefits of sharing.     There’s nothing wrong with these tendencies. Ultimately, we’re all social beings, and without one another to rely on, life would be not only intolerable but meaningless. Yet our mutual dependence has unexpected consequences, one of which is that if people do not make decisions independently — if even in part they like things because other people like them — then predicting hits is not only difficult but actually impossible, no matter how much you know about individual tastes.     The reason is that when people tend to like what other people like, differences in popularity are subject to what is called “cumulative advantage,” or the “rich get richer” effect. This means that if one object happens to be slightly more popular than another at just the right point, it will tend to become more popular still. As a result, even tiny, random fluctuations can blow up, generating potentially enormous long-run differences among even indistinguishable competitors — a phenomenon that is similar in some ways to the famous “butterfly effect” from chaos theory. Thus, if history were to be somehow rerun many times, seemingly identical universes with the same set of competitors and the same overall market tastes would quickly generate different winners: [Madonna](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/_madonna/index.html?inline=nyt-per) would have been popular in this world, but in some other version of history, she would be a nobody, and someone we have never heard of would be in her place.

Here is a graph based on numbers taken from the article (and taken, in turn, from the consumer research group Books Marketing). Click it to see it bigger.\n\nIt shows that from 2003 to 2006 the big winners are the supermarkets and the online retailers - the twin jaws of the digital vice. No surprises there.\nIt also shows that the big losers are the chain bookstores (Waterstones in particular) and the direct mail book clubs. Again, no surprises.\nThe green line is the independent bookstores. They are still bigger (for a few years anyway) than online retailers and have actually improved their share from 15.6 to 15.9% of the market.\nThere are some other statistical nuggets in the article. See if you can make sense of these:\nFigures vary for the growth of book sales in Britain, but each source points to at least small but steady growth. The Publishers Association says that 459m books were sold in the UK in 2005, slightly fewer than in 2004, but ahead of the three previous years. Nielsen Bookscan, which only counts books sold at retail level (not including sales to schools for example), says that 225m books were sold last year in Britain with a value of £1.7bn. Nielsen draws a straight line of gains from 2001 when its records show 163m books sold with a value of £1.2bn. Waterstone's reckons the market is growing at a more sedate 2% a year... If not exactly thriving, the independent book store is not in as dire straits as many fear. According to the Booksellers Association, a trade group for retailers, the number of independents has fallen from 1,700 in 2000 to 1,400 today. But that figure now appears to have stabilised. There are an increasing number of small publishers targeting the independents... \"Publishers are falling over backwards to sell to supermarkets at very large discounts,\" he says. \"The focus on celebrity memoirs and potential bestsellers is relentless and the proportion of book sales by authors in the top 50 is going up and up. The middle band of authors is finding life increasingly tough. The spread has diminished and that trend will continue in the short term at least as competition gets more intense.

The subtitle is How Many Minds Produce Knowledge and it\u0026rsquo;s all about mechanisms - particularly Internet-driven mechanisms - for combining the insights of many people to produce, as he says, knowledge. It\u0026rsquo;s a good, thought-provoking book and I recommend it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s something I had to struggle with: Sunstein is a big proponent of using prediction markets to make some kinds of decision, and he is very doubtful about the merits of deliberation: sticking people in a room and talking things out to come to a decision.\nMy first reaction is that I feel deliberation should be workable, and my first reaction to markets is suspicion - enhanced by the fact that Sunstein comes from the University of Chicago, where the very right-wing Economics and Law movement came from. I don\u0026rsquo;t know Sunstein\u0026rsquo;s politics, but it\u0026rsquo;s clear from the book that his heart is in the right place. He believes in the importance of marginalized people whose opinions and knowledge are too often overlooked, and in the contributions they can make. So is there a case for markets in the situations he\u0026rsquo;s talking about, in the aggregation of knowledge?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think about my hostility to markets.\nThose of a libertarian right-wing outlook see the source of social problems as hierarchy, centralization, planning, bureaucracy, socialism, and the state. Socialists see the source of social problems as the concentration of wealth, privilege, and ownership in the hands of the few.\nThe dispute spills over into the realm of the mechanisms we look to as bulwarks against oppression.\nThose of us on the left, believing in the ability of wealth to divide and conquer, look to collective action as protection against private ownership of property. It\u0026rsquo;s the old story - hang together or hang separately. Co-operatives, co-operation, unions, solidarity.\nThose on the right see collective institutions as bearing the seeds of oppression and coercive suppression of individual liberty. They look to individualistic mechanisms such as property rights and markets as protection. Free exchange respects individual autonomy and liberty - but those of us on the left see the potential for exploitation, the rule of money, and marginalization of those without the price of entrance into the market.\nAn economic way of phrasing this is that both sides see principal-agent problems as a root cause of oppression. The potential for moral hazard is there in both collective organizations and in any organization with market power: the temptation to oppress, to deceive, to lie, to mislead are all present. Failures of information (asymmetric information among others) and problems of transaction costs are ubiquitous.\nIn all this, it\u0026rsquo;s worth reflecting on what is central and what is secondary. What matters, after all, is liberty, equality, fraternity (and sorority as well). The questions of markets, voting, democracy, deliberation, are instrumental questions. To some extent we can separate them from the primary problem. My suspicion of and distrust of markets comes from a belief in the alienating effect and excluding effects of turning things that matter into commodities to be bought and sold - particularly in highly unequal societies.\nSo when it comes to using markets as a deliberation mechanism - including markets using virtual money - then my suspicions may not be relevant. Yes, the proponents of these instruments hark back to Hayek - whose politics I shy from - and his The Use of Knowledge in Society. Does this mean I must object to the use of, say, prediction markets to gain information? A clear-sighted view must say no.\nPerhaps, at the same time, it would do me good to question the use of deliberation as a means of making decisions and pooling information. Feminists have long maintained, after all, that marginal groups get excluded from such discussions in a statistical manner, if not an absolute one.\nReading Infotopia was a great way for me to address these unasked questions because Sunstein himself presents the strengths and weaknesses of both sides of his argument. He may be a lawyer, but he\u0026rsquo;s not in court here, arguing for his client at all costs. The book has a balanced, open-minded approach that is a refreshing change from Some Other Book I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading lately. (Or maybe he knows that readers respond to indications of open-mindedness, and he\u0026rsquo;s just a more skilled proponent of his own point of view? Whatever, it works). His equivocation and insistence on making distinctions is welcome. It prompts questions in the reader, rather than diverting the reader past the problems.\nSo I recommend this book. It\u0026rsquo;ll make you wonder what\u0026rsquo;s happening when you are next with a group of people trying to talk your way to a decision. And it makes me want to look at some prediction market software for use at the workplace.\nIt does have limitations. The big one is that it\u0026rsquo;s really just a starter. It could do with going a lot further in addressing the uses and limits of the tools he investigates. Markets, for example, seem suited only to questions that have numerical answers (price) or binary answers - but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention this limitation or what follows from it. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t distinguish cases where membership in a group is open from where it is closed, or compulsory participation versus voluntary. He briefly mentions a hybrid technique called Delphi, with a mixture of deliberation and voting, but only briefly. There is little about referenda, demand-revealing or otherwise, and little about other forms of voting or methods for achieving consensus in an inclusive fashion. Finally, he does not address the question of learning. Discussion, after all, is not just about decision-making but is also about learning, while markets separate the two. So the reader is left with a lot of open questions at the end of the book. But these would have turned it into a much bigger book too, and right now it\u0026rsquo;s good and short and thought provoking, which is plenty.\n","date":1176677804,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"69f504a509f1c4f49f08b6e40a7f1ee1","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/infotopiacass_s/","publishdate":"2007-04-15T22:56:44Z","relpermalink":"/post/infotopiacass_s/","section":"post","summary":"Cass Sunstein is a University of Chicago Law Professor whose book, Infotopia, I got to read on a recent trip.

It was late March 2005 and Verrilli must have felt like he was on top of the world.    No one ever gave me directions like this on a golf course before: \"Aim at either Microsoft or IBM\". I was standing on the first tee at the KGA golf club in downtown Bangalore, in southern India, when my playing partner pointed at two shiny glass-and-steel buildings off in the distance, just behind the first green.    It was late in the afternoon, on a typically harsh Canadian winter day, as Rob McEwen, the CEO of Goldcorp Inc., stood at the head of the boardroom table confronting a room full of senior geologists.    In 1988, a British mountain climber named Joe Simpson wrote a book called Touching the Void, a harrowing account of near death in the Peruvian Andes. It got good reviews but, only a modest success, it was soon forgotten. Then, a decade later, a strange thing happened. Jon Krakauer wrote Into Thin Air, another book about a mountain-climbing tragedy, which became a publishing sensation. Suddenly Touching the Void started to sell again.    For Hush Puppies - the classic American brushed-suede shoes with the lightweight crepe sole -- the Tipping Point came somewhere between late 1994 and early 1995. The brand had been all but dead until that point. Sales were down to 30,000 pairs a year, mostly to backwoods outlets and small-town family stores. Wolverine, the company that makes Hush Puppies, was thinking about phasing out the shoes that made them famous. But then something strange happened.    About six years ago, I went to the Gap to buy a pair of jeans. I tend to wear my jeans until they're falling apart, so it had been quite a while since my last purchase. A nice young salesperson walked up to me and asked if she could help.    One day in the fall of 1906, the British scientist Francis Galton left his home in the town of Plymouth and headed for a country fair. Galton was eighty-five years old and beginning to feel his age, but he was still brimming with the curiosity that had won him renown -- and notoriety -- for his work on statistics and the science of heredity. And on that particular day, what Galton was curious about was livestock.    Croesus, King of Lydia, was considered the richest man of his time. To this day Romance languages use the expression \"rich as Croesus\" to describe a person of excessive wealth. He was said to to be visited by Solon, the Greek legislator known for his dignity, reserve, upright morals, humility, wisdom, intelligence, and courage. Solon did not display the smallest surprise at the wealth and splendour surrounding his host, nor the tiniest admiration for their owner.    Early on the morning of April 8, 1994, the electrician arrived to start work on a new security system being installed at an upscale home overlooking Lake Washington, just north of Seattle. In the greenhouse, he found the owner of the cottage, Kurt Cobain, lying dead on the floor in a pool of blood.    J-20. For those in the know the acronym is easily decipherable: July 20, 2001, the call for action transmitted to hundreds of thousands at the click of a mouse. J-20 - Genoa.     Its not only become predictable to start books this way, it\u0026rsquo;s patronizing.\nFirst, the story is obviously a setup, selected precisely so that it illustrates the point the author wants to make, so we\u0026rsquo;re being led down a path here. It has the effect of making me suspicious - it\u0026rsquo;s misdirection: what\u0026rsquo;s up the author\u0026rsquo;s sleeve?\nSecond: it says to the reader \u0026ldquo;this is going to be an easy read: don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you won\u0026rsquo;t have to think too hard\u0026rdquo;. Yet almost all these books claim to have important things to say (and a few of them actually do). Do we need this dressing up, this dose of sugar? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Get to the point please - if you have one. The idea that profound truths can be identified and transmitted without effort is seductive, but misleading.\nFinally, when some of these books have business leaders saying \u0026ldquo;this book is deep and really influenced us\u0026rdquo; then you have to wonder about what their idea of deep thinking is.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I think obscurity and dull prose are the mark of a serious book (or is it?) but this \u0026ldquo;who moved my cheese?\u0026rdquo; approach to avoiding proper thinking is a horrible trend.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a great way to start a non-fiction book. I\u0026rsquo;m cheating - it\u0026rsquo;s from the beginning of Chapter 2 - but Chapter 1 is a kind of preface so I think it qualifies:\nStreets in cities serve many purposes besides carrying vehicles, and city sidewalks - the pedestrian parts of streets - serve many purposes besides carrying pedestrians.    It\u0026rsquo;s unfamiliar - who thinks about sidewalks and what they do? And what could these other purposes be? So it immediately raises questions in the mind of the reader, prompting active thought and questioning - rather than a comfortable, cocooning \u0026ldquo;Let me tell you a story\u0026rdquo; beginning.\nWant more? A recent discussion at Crooked Timber lists many academic examples.\nNo prizes for guessing the most titles from those above - not even spare chocolate eggs - but I\u0026rsquo;d be interested if anyone can recognize some.\n","date":1176460440,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d90022b32a5c284eed354a2c058f02c5","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/tired_of_anecdo/","publishdate":"2007-04-13T10:34:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tired_of_anecdo/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m tired of the way so many business and cultural books start with a story.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\n\u0026ldquo;Coda\u0026rdquo; is the very last section of the Long Tail, and this is the very last section of my critique of the book.\nThe book\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Coda\u0026rdquo; is a two page piece that talks about 3D printers, which may enable all kinds of other goods to become digital - just as documents and music and photos and videos have all moved from being solid things to being digital - \u0026ldquo;materialized\u0026rdquo; where you download them.\nAnd the lesson of 3D printing is that we\u0026rsquo;ll see \u0026ldquo;the explosion of variety we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in our culture thanks to digital efficiencies\u0026rdquo; [226] extended to other areas of our lives.\nThe coda summarizes some of the things I find so frustrating about this book, and why I\u0026rsquo;ve spent so much time on it. It\u0026rsquo;s not just that it\u0026rsquo;s a bad book - although I do believe it is - but that it is a bad book about some really important changes; changes with the potential to do great good and great harm. Reading Chris Kenny\u0026rsquo;s reflective commentary emphasized this for me. Anderson holds up a picture that is very attractive - greater diversity, a broadening of voices in public discussion, a chance for people without connections to have a say, and so on - and he says he\u0026rsquo;s all for it. And he\u0026rsquo;s all against stodgy old \u0026ldquo;institutions\u0026rdquo;. So the book attracts people who are doing interesting things, and thinking along admirable lines.\nBut then he betrays us. Because when it comes down to it, he\u0026rsquo;s on the side of multi-millionaires and billionaires, and the \u0026ldquo;institutions\u0026rdquo; he feels so rebellious about are small publishers, small bookshops, and so on. Not that he\u0026rsquo;d put it that way, but that\u0026rsquo;s the effect of his arguments. He argues that we should celebrate Netflix, Amazon and a handful of others, and trust them to be the custodians of our culture because they\u0026rsquo;ll deliver variety. It\u0026rsquo;s a dangerous argument, predicated on the fact that these are somehow different companies - a kinder capitalism. And it\u0026rsquo;s wrong, of course.\nTo review, here\u0026rsquo;s what I see as the main flaws that run throughout the book:\nFlimsy Foundations - Despite the talk of openness, the empirical core of the book is a set of numbers vouched for only by the CEO\u0026rsquo;s of companies who stand to benefit from their association with radical new ideas. Netflix, Amazon, iTunes and Rhapsody let him see their figures under strict conditions. There is, in the end, little to demonstrate that some of these companies are delivering on the promise of the Long Tail. The evidence that iTunes is a \u0026ldquo;Long Tail aggregator\u0026rdquo;, for example, is non-existent.\nProtean Perspectives - The Long Tail is sometimes a set of rules for how to build a profitable business, sometimes an assertion about economic and technological forces, and sometimes a claim about cultural change. The book tries to shove Wikipedia, blogs, Netflix, and more into a single tent - and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold. I\u0026rsquo;ve no problem with using a single name for multiple related ideas, but Anderson shifts from one meaning to another to another throughout the book, and the result is a form of misdirection as he invokes whichever is needed to make the point he wants to make. It makes criticism difficult, but in the end consistency matters, and the book lacks it. Instead of each part of the story strengthening the others, the whole edifice turns out to be built on nothing.\nFailure to Follow the Money - As Bertoldt Brecht said \u0026ldquo;Amongst the highly placed it is considered low to talk about food. The fact is: they have already eaten.\u0026rdquo; Of course the CEOs of new technology businesses aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in talking about something as mundane as money, but we must, and Anderson doesn\u0026rsquo;t. This matters for two reasons.\nFirst, the book conflates non-commercial and commercial initiatives - Amazon\u0026rsquo;s recommendation engine and Wikipedia, for example - as if they are not different. But they are. There is much talk of community on the web, but corporate-sponsored \u0026ldquo;communities\u0026rdquo;, while they do have their place, are not communities in any significant sense. On the other hand, an effort like Indymedia is a real community. These are different things. I have worried that by emphasizing how different the phenomena of the web are that I\u0026rsquo;m missing the big picture - but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty confident that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. The Long Tail big picture is a mirage: the closer you get to it, the less tangible it is.\nSecond, there is a political effect that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen with successful aggregators. A single iTunes, coupled with Wal-Mart, drives many independent businesses out of existence. The result is the opposite of the democratization Anderson claims to be promoting. The emergence of iTunes is a centralization of influence within the music industry, not a decentralization. Amazon is not a proletarian revolt against the tyranny of elitist bookshops, it\u0026rsquo;s the driving out of many small businesses by one big business. Money is flowing through these new organizations, and it is flowing towards fewer people than ever, not more. To ignore the impact of technology on inequality is to take a political stance, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a progressive one.\nSelective Vision - We see this in the comparison of the \u0026ldquo;old world\u0026rdquo; to the \u0026ldquo;new world\u0026rdquo;. By comparing Rhapsody music to Wal-Mart, Anderson is stacking the deck - something he does throughout the entire book. What\u0026rsquo;s more, he\u0026rsquo;s mistaking the dynamic that is at work in the world of business. While Anderson sees online commerce as challenging the Wal-Marts of the world, it too often complements them. If I had these posts to write over again I\u0026rsquo;d start off at the beginning by pointing out that technological forces are creating, not a Long Tail, but a technological vice. On one jaw is the big box store, stocking a few titles at cheap prices. On the other jaw is the online store, stocking everything (but not necessarily selling a whole lot of everything). This is not the way to produce a culture of variety. My prediction: as these enterprises realise how complementary they are, we\u0026rsquo;ll start to see more in the way of mergers between the two worlds.\nSelective vision is also at work in his perception of the new companies. While the book celebrates the open sides of their business models, he completely ignores the other side. Google, Amazon, Netflix are all secretive when they want to be. They all pursue patents with vigour in order to close down the possibility of competition. Netflix even patented its \u0026ldquo;mailing and response envelope\u0026rdquo; - this is not \u0026ldquo;radical transparency\u0026rdquo; as Anderson has taken to calling it. We the consumers are let inside the walls to play, but in a carefully controlled playroom. And we\u0026rsquo;re kept out away from the valuables.\nFinally, in his enthusiasm to celebrate variety he bundles pseudo-variety (wall-of-toothpaste variety) with real variety. Is there no distinction? Of course there is, but Mr. Anderson is blind to it.\nThe end result of all this selection is a muddled and distorted picture. It sounds great at first reading, as Anderson runs through examples of new variety at breakneck speed, but stop a minute and you realise he\u0026rsquo;s only telling one half of the story - and half the story can never give the whole picture, no matter how many examples he finds. And even then he\u0026rsquo;s not telling it straight.\nSo what do I think? Do I think the Internet is a force for good or bad? Yes. Is it a force for increased decentralization or increased centralization? Absolutely. Is new technology a source of increased variety or increased homogeneity? No doubt about it.\nThe Internet and related technologies are going to have a huge effect on our society. Or rather, many huge effects. And which ones win out - the good or the bad - will be determined by people actively struggling to ensure that their vision of it prevails, not by trusting to the market to solve it for us. Part of the appeal of The Long Tail is that it talks of the \u0026ldquo;democratization of production\u0026rdquo;. Innovative cultural ideas (as opposed to technical ideas) will often be found at the margins; in Jane Jacobs wonderful phrase \u0026ldquo;new ideas need old buildings\u0026rdquo;, and this means they need to be done on the cheap, often subsidized through non-market routes, and nourished. While Internet technologies are one more path that cultural innovators can follow, it is a big mistake to trust commercial enterprises, be it Amazon or Netflix, to act as custodians of the public space that is variety. With his heart, I suspect, in the right place, Anderson is leading us down a dangerous road, and that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve spent so many hours showing what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with his book.\nFor anyone who has made it to the end, let me finish by pointing you to a posting on the Long Tail blog, where Chris Anderson walks through the major objections to his book. Here are his \u0026ldquo;top five mistakes\u0026rdquo; with a one sentence answer from Anderson (there\u0026rsquo;s more on his blog):\nX was a hit! See? Hits aren't dead. - \"I never said they were\" I've done an analysis of this dataset and, in percentage terms, it shows that sales are become more concentrated in the head, not less - \"Hah! This is the percentage mistake.\" I'm in the Long Tail and I'm not rich yet - the theory clearly doesn't work. - \"The big money in the Long Tail is in aggregation\" You said that 57% of Amazon sales are Long Tail. No way. - \"I know. That part .. has been revised to 25%\" You call Blockbuster and Barnes \u0026 Noble the Short Head. But what about Blockbuster.com and BN.com? They've got every bit as big an inventory as Netflix and Amazon. - \"Sigh. Please understand the definitions. Short Head = inventory in the typical store of the largest bricks and mortar retailer in a market.    None of these objections is a significant part of what I\u0026rsquo;ve presented here, except for number 3 - and I still think it is true that a \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; unaffected by a 100% change in a major piece of data is a theory that needs a more empirical basis and a little less enthusiasm. My objections are on other grounds entirely. I suspect they come too late to slow down the passage of \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo; into the conventional wisdom of technological/business discussions but hey, you do what you can.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m getting tired, and need to get to the end of this book quickly. Then I can write a wrap-up post and be done. This final chapter (almost! there is a \u0026ldquo;coda\u0026rdquo;) contains nine rules for building \u0026ldquo;a Consumer Paradise\u0026rdquo; [217], grouped under three headings. Here we go.\nLower Your Costs [217-219]\nRule 1: Move inventory to the edge - The advice is to transfer your costs to your suppliers: keep a virtual inventory. For example, Amazon Marketplace products are \u0026ldquo;held at the very edge of the network by thousands of small merchants. Cost to Amazon: zero\u0026rdquo; [218].\nRule 2: Let customers do the work - He calls this \u0026ldquo;crowdsourcing\u0026rdquo; [219]. Let customer reviews rank your books, write your content, and so on, because \u0026ldquo;collectively, customers have virtually unlimited time and energy\u0026rdquo; [219].\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve said repeatedly, the benefits of being an aggregator are that you profit from being a natural monopoly, or at least part of a natural oligopoly. Once you can establish yourself as the place to be, vendors will want to - have little choice but to - sell their stuff on your site. Once you become the bookstore of choice, customers may add their reviews to your site. But of course there is one place where the Long Tail does not really eliminate scarcity - and that\u0026rsquo;s in the supply of aggregators. When inventory is stored at the edge someone is still paying the cost of stocking it - it\u0026rsquo;s just not Amazon. The Long Tail slides back and forth between talking about zero-cost (total) and zero-cost (someone-else\u0026rsquo;s cost) - but never says which one is which. These are different things.\nOne of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in both sides of the technological vice (online stores + big-box stores) is that power has shifted away from manufacturers and to retail outlets. Amazon can sell goods without paying for them first. Wal-Mart is trying to introduce systems that will pay suppliers only when someone actually buys a product, so that their own shelf space becomes free (to them). It\u0026rsquo;s a power shift leading to a transfer of costs, not a cutting of costs - and power matters.\nThink Niche [219-221]\nRule 3 - One distribution method doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit all\nRule 4 - One product doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit all\nRule 5 - One price doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit all.\nAs with much of the book, this section contains unsubstantiated claims: Rhapsody is \u0026ldquo;experimenting with track prices from $0.79 to $0.49 and finding that cutting the price in half roughly triples sales\u0026rdquo; [221]. Really? How often? All of them? We need more than this. And if the experiment was so successful, then we may wonder why the current (April 2007) Rhapsody web site says this:\nCan I download tracks with Rhapsody? Yes. You can purchase music from Rhapsody for $0.99/track, or $0.89/track with a membership.    No mention of variable pricing beyond encouraging membership.\nLose Control [221-224]\nRule 6 - Share information. Well, up to a point. One of the most pervasive ironies of the whole book is that it keeps going on about sharing information, but the very facts that are at the core of the book are hidden behind some of the thickest walls around. Actual Netflix sales distributions? Actual sales of Amazon books? Actual sales of iTunes music? None of it is here. Quite why Anderson thinks we are in a new age of openness is beyond me.\nRule 7 - Think \u0026lsquo;And\u0026rsquo;, not \u0026lsquo;Or\u0026rsquo;\nRule 8 - Trust the market to do your job - His advice is to \u0026ldquo;throw everything out there and let the market sort it out\u0026rdquo;, which is really a restatement of his Rule 2 - Let customers do the work. As I\u0026rsquo;ve said before, there is a big difference between what works for aggregators and what works for producing actual variety.\nAs just one example that I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned before, Anderson keeps on about how referrals allow customers to move from the head to the tail of the distribution. But what happens if you start at the tail? No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart is currently (April 6) ranked 381374. The recommended books that appear on the page have the following rankings: 475137, 18675, 201, DVD #569, and 90396. That is, if you start off in the tail, the recommendation system pushes you back up towards the head of the distribution. Hence Amazon can profit by stocking all books, even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sell much of them, because the reference system is a way of promoting other, better selling books. Now I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the net effect is, but neither does Mr. Anderson.\nRule 9 - Understand the power of free is an argument for combining premium pricing and a free version of what you provide (fair enough), and for an advertising-supported revenue model. Well if one thing is becoming ubiquitous, it\u0026rsquo;s advertising. Is this a move to a niche nation or a numb nation? I for one do not welcome our new advertising-sponsored overlords. Consumer paradise? I think not.\n","date":1176106150,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0210c9112d9fdab0a43c9a8047eeeee5","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_1_1/","publishdate":"2007-04-09T08:09:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_1_1/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 14 - Long Tail Rules.

Do I have to do it all again with Wikinomics ? Am I doomed to be a perpetual curmudgeon? If rabble.ca\u0026rsquo;s newest venture is anything to go by, the answer is yes.\nrabble.ca is a news site that I generally like. It describes itself this way:\n_ rabble.ca_ was built on the efforts of progressive journalists, writers, artists and activists across the country. We launched rabble on April 18, 2001, just before the protests against the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City, and leapt onto the Net with the kind of coverage you could only get from the point of view of the rabble. We have covered events and issues in ways you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else ever since.    And I\u0026rsquo;d often agree - they reprint pieces by Rick Salutin, Linda MacQuaig, Thomas Walkom, Jim Stanford, Scott Piatkowski and other smart and left-wing journalists and commentators. It was founded by Judy Rebick. (For those of you outside Canada, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of Canadian lefty cred in the names in this paragraph.)\nSo why oh why are they giving a whole lot of space to Wikinomics, the web 2.0, long-tail-like wealth-of-networks, wisdom-of-crowds book by Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams. They\u0026rsquo;re even holding a virtual event in Second Life.\nrabble.ca must think there is something about the book that is \u0026ldquo;progressive\u0026rdquo;. But what it is defeats me entirely. Could it be the front-cover blurb by the CEO of Procter \u0026amp; Gamble? The praise by executives from ATT, the World Economic Forum, OgilvyOne, IBM, and Roche Diagnostics, Socialtext, Royal Bank of Canada, Walt Disney, MetLife, Google, and Cisco? Is it this week\u0026rsquo;s Business Week Special?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read chapter 1 (available here) and it\u0026rsquo;s Long Tail all over again. Breathless prose (\u0026ldquo;we are entering a new age\u0026hellip; liberate people to participate in innovation and wealth creation within every sector of the economy\u0026hellip; a world where knowledge, power, and productive capability will be more dispersed than at any time in our history\u0026hellip; harness the new collaboration or perish\u0026hellip; - and that\u0026rsquo;s just in the first dozen pages). Promises of democracy, empowerment of regular people (that\u0026rsquo;s you and me, squire), the breaking down of old hierarchies. It sounds great. But\u0026hellip;\nI hate to say it, but in these tech-utopian books why does no one follow the money? If we\u0026rsquo;re all so empowered and trust our peers, how come they get CEOs to blurb their book? If we\u0026rsquo;re all so productive, how come inequality is increasing - and nowhere more so than in high tech industries?\nAnd just like the Long Tail, the word-pictures the authors sketch are massively selective in their portrayal of the past and the future. The past is all rigid hierarchy, the future (left to technology and markets, apparently) is all explosive growth and innovative open source. IBM is promoted as \u0026ldquo;embracing open source\u0026rdquo; but they don\u0026rsquo;t mention how it just set a record for the number of patents in a year. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this at least part of the picture?\nI feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve read the book already. For those who have been following my Long Tail grumbles, doesn\u0026rsquo;t the following paragraph read just like Mr. Anderson?\nFor individuals and small producers, this may be the birth of a new era, perhaps even a golden one, on par with the Italian renaissance or the rise of Athenian democracy. Mass collaboration across borders, disciplines, and cultures is at once economical and enjoyable... A new economic democracy is emerging in which we all have a lead role.    Come on rabble.ca: just because the new executives don\u0026rsquo;t wear ties, business is still about the money. Technology is fine, but politics still exists. You disappoint me.\nBut wait! It so happens I know a thing or two about chemistry, and Wikinomics has something just for me, right there in Chapter 1. Maybe this will save the book for me.\n\"Or perhaps your thing is chemistry. Indeed, if you're a retired, unemployed, or aspiring chemist, Procter \u0026 Gamble needs your help... Now you can work for P\u0026G without being on their payroll\".    Is this some kind of joke?

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nThis penultimate chapter of the book describes \u0026ldquo;five examples of the Long Tail at work outside of media and entertainment\u0026rdquo; [201]. These examples are eBay, KitchenAid, Lego, Salesforce.com, and Google. There is another side to each of these stories.\neBay [201-203] has been hugely successful at being a marketplace for all kinds of odds and ends. Is it a Long Tail success?\nThe other side of the story. Let\u0026rsquo;s remember that a Long Tail business is one that provides both the \u0026ldquo;head\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;tail\u0026rdquo; of products. As Anderson writes, MP3.com was a music aggregation site, but it failed. The \u0026ldquo;problem with MP3.com was that it was only Long Tail\u0026rdquo; [149]. Meanwhile, iTunes focused more on the head, and makes all its money from it, then apparently builds on the familiarity it provides to use smart software to help people expand their tastes. Its growth came from being a marketplace for junk; Anderson\u0026rsquo;s story of its growth implicitly admits this by saying that it \u0026ldquo;now does far more than clear the nation\u0026rsquo;s attics\u0026rdquo; [202]. eBay is a broker (\u0026ldquo;facilitator\u0026rdquo; [202]) that matches buyers and sellers.\neBay breaks a second rule for Long Tail businesses. Because it does not stand between the buyers and sellers (unlike Alibris and Amazon Marketplace, as we saw in Chapter 6, who ensure that they are the hub of all transactions and so collect all the information from both buyer and seller), eBay \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t offer many of the powerful filter technologies, such as recommendation engines, that drive demand so effectively at other Long Tail retailers\u0026rdquo; [203]. Putting aside yet again the question of how successful they are in reality as opposed to imagination, this \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; model he has in his head leads Anderson to suggest that eBay has a \u0026ldquo;vulnerability\u0026rdquo; [203] because of its reluctance to collect information about all the trades going on under its virtual roof.\nWhat Anderson doesn\u0026rsquo;t point out is that the eBay model gives the small vendor who is selling through eBay a bigger say in the sale. I find the eBay model more \u0026ldquo;democratic\u0026rdquo; to use one of the book\u0026rsquo;s favourite words, in that it actually shares information with the vendors rather than hiding information from them as Alibris and, apparently, Amazon Marketplace do.\neBay is a huge success, an important story, but not a Long Tail one in all but the most crude sense. Yes, it sells a lot of many things, but as Anderson says when he wants to spin things in that direction, that\u0026rsquo;s not the force behind the Long Tail story.\nKitchenAid [203-205] is a little anecdote about how the maker of small kitchen appliances sells lots of colours (\u0026ldquo;over 50\u0026rdquo;) online, compared to only a handful in the stores it supplies.\nThe other side. Whoop-de-do: this is nothing that can\u0026rsquo;t be done in a catalogue. It\u0026rsquo;s a neat thing for KitchenAid to do, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing fundamental here.\nLego [205-207] is building an online community of enthusiasts, who design and share their own constructions (\u0026ldquo;peer production\u0026rdquo; [206]) and can order the pieces to provide them. Is this the \u0026ldquo;Long Tail of plastic bricks\u0026rdquo; [207]?\nThe other side. Lego may like openness and they are trying some interesting things (Mindstorms for example), but there is another part to this story. Lego is as interested in fixed ownership as ever: it has been fighting the loss of its patents for years. With the effort to extend its patent on the blocks themselves failing, it is nevertheless continuing to extend their patents and prevent other companies from making inroads in the world of blocks.\nSalesforce.com [207-210] is an innovative company that is succeeding in a big way. It provides \u0026ldquo;hosted software\u0026rdquo; to companies (mainly small companies) to carry out \u0026ldquo;customer relationship management\u0026rdquo; tasks (CRM). Now it wants to become a one-stop shop: an aggregator for business applications, in the same way that Amazon is an aggregator for books. Salesforce has set up a platform called AppExchange that would \u0026ldquo;allow hundreds of smaller developers, many of them in low-cost places such as India, to reach those same customers\u0026rdquo; [208].\nAppExchange may succeed in its goal. It\u0026rsquo;s as close as Anderson comes to a legitimate Long Tail story here. In addition, Salesforce.com has just hired Peter Coffee, an industry journalist who has long been one of the smartest technical commentators on software, to handle part of its platform.\nThe other side. This is a story in its early days. There are two sides to the move to aggregation and platforms: the owner of the winning platform in a particular area can win big, and Salesforce may become one of those winners unless Google or one of its other competitors beats it. It is less clear how much of its revenue will come from niche providers (no figures yet), and it is even less clear that the providers of goods for those platforms can win significantly. I suspect that many participants in AppExchange will share the opinions of Geoff Merrick, chief architect of Salesforce partner Okere, who says \u0026ldquo;his company views being on the AppExchange as a way of developing name recognition rather than as a source of revenue\u0026rdquo;. The venture is new, and the verdict is not yet in. Let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nGoogle [210-216] is included here on the basis of extending the advertising market into the Long Tail with its Adwords and AdSense programs. Traditional advertising, Anderson says, \u0026ldquo;is a classic, hit-centric industry where high costs enforce a focus on the biggest sellers and buyers\u0026rdquo; [210]. Now, with customizable search engines (maps, images, etc), and the fact that most search terms are different (no surprise there) Anderson claims that Google is \u0026ldquo;barreling down the Long Tail of everything\u0026rdquo; [206].\nThe other side: The portrayal of \u0026ldquo;traditional advertising\u0026rdquo; is a straw man, like so many of the setups for the stories in this book. Traditional advertising is not just car companies advertising on prime-time television, it includes classifieds, Yellow Pages ads, flyers inserted in local newpapers, and so on. And does the Google money come from nowhere, or is this a shift of advertising budgets for small players from these local-focused efforts onto the Internet? There is nothing here to tell us. If advertising is shifting from local papers to Google Adsense, you can\u0026rsquo;t just close one eye and say \u0026ldquo;I see a Long Tail\u0026rdquo;. Well, you can, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean much.\nEven as a story of business success, there are no figures here. How much of Google\u0026rsquo;s revenue comes from its \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo; of advertising? He doesn\u0026rsquo;t say. Somehow the vaunted openness that the book is so keen on always stops one step short of actual revenue breakdowns, whether its Netflix or Google. Anderson does admit that \u0026ldquo;Although most of its [Google\u0026rsquo;s] revenues come from the head of the curve, most of its customers are somewhere in the tail\u0026rdquo; [215], which makes you wonder what the revenue pattern is for Google. At the time of its $1B investment in AOL just over a year ago, the BBC reported that \u0026ldquo;AOL is currently Google\u0026rsquo;s biggest customer. During the first nine months of this year [2005], it accounted for about $429m, or 10% of Google\u0026rsquo;s revenue.\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m nipping round the edges of the ideas in this book, but the lack of substance and lack of solid figures continues to irritate. Big Picture thinking is one thing, but this hyper-optimistic selective vision is another.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just be clear here - I\u0026rsquo;m sure that there will be many success stories in the coming years of companies who build aggregation platforms for various kinds of content, and who make a LOT of money doing so. I\u0026rsquo;m just not convinced that most of their revenue will come from \u0026ldquo;the Tail\u0026rdquo; of their content. Despite the talk of \u0026ldquo;democracy\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that the residents of the Tail will benefit much; and I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not convinced the net effect on our culture is one of increased real variety and diversity.\n","date":1175863238,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"9689cd6c876334ec566988fe909e6420","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_1/","publishdate":"2007-04-06T12:40:38Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_1/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 13 - Beyond Entertainment.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nShould we give Chris Anderson a break when it comes to Google Video?\nThe second sentence of Chapter 12 is \u0026ldquo;On January 19, 2006, Google unveiled Google Video, the ultimate Long Tail marketplace of the moving image\u0026rdquo; [193]. Of course, Google Video has been what us pre-digital folks call a \u0026ldquo;total bust\u0026rdquo; and YouTube (which doesn\u0026rsquo;t get a mention in the book) is everywhere - so much so that Google bought it.\nWell, in January 2007 Chris Anderson admitted that he got it wrong:\nThis is not to say that there aren't many things I don't cover in the book but should have, and a few things I _did_ cover but shouldn't have *cough* Google Video *cough*.    So yes, let\u0026rsquo;s give him a break. I mean, who knew? Not me. So let\u0026rsquo;s put it on record that I\u0026rsquo;m giving him a free pass on this one.\nBut back to the point. Chapter 12 argues that TV is facing a Long Tail challenge from Internet video, and it starts off by charting the rise of Internet video with a comparison:\nMSNBC's The Abrams Report, with a multimillion-dollar budget and a crew of dozens was at the time of this writing watched by an average of 215,000 homes per day. Rocketboom, a Jon Stewart-like comedy news program created online by exactly two people for the cost of some videotapes, two lights, and a cardboard map, was watched by 200,000 homes per day over the same period. Now it's selling advertising and got $40,000 for the five thirty-second spots in its first week. Not quite as high as broadcast TV revenues, perhaps, but the networks would kill for those margins. ...A generation that grew up online and developed its media consumption habits in the bandwidth paradise of American university dorm rooms is now totally comfortable watching video on a computer screen. [193]    Rocketboom may be a comedy news program (5 minutes per day) but let\u0026rsquo;s just note it isn\u0026rsquo;t news. There is no investigation going on, just some messing around with a camera, and studio comedy is pretty cheap no matter how you do it (that\u0026rsquo;s why the cable channels had all those stand-ups on until they discovered reality TV - comedians come cheap). So the financial comparison is a bit apples and oranges.\nBut the big thing here is to ask where the Rocketboom numbers come from. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen that Chris Anderson is relentlessly optimistic in his view of internet technologies, and he lets that attitude get in the way of his objectivity here. Those first-week ads were something of a publicity stunt, bein auctioned on eBay according the the MIT Advertising Lab. A recent posting by the same MIT Advertising Lab shows that the story is different now:\n[Rocketboom](http://www.rocketboom.com/) is searching for a new way to put fuel in its tank. Advertising is not doing it. \"It's frustrating that we haven't worked it out by now,\" said the daily video blog's founder, Andrew Baron. \"Even though we have a relatively large audience, advertisers are just not happy to do 'small deals,' he explained in an interview. Baron says there are 200,000 downloads of Rocketboom shows, seven days a week. 'They say they want to blast their commercials to millions of people.' So, Rocketboom is again toying with the idea of charging for content. ([MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/internet-daily-rocketboom-may-charge/story.aspx?guid=%7BE853CAC4%2D78BE%2D443E%2D822E%2D4FDAFA1D33C7%7D))     Andrew Baron [last summer](http://www.dembot.com/009793.html): \"Or maybe in the future we will decide to take a hit and not run ads some days because we could afford to.\"     Wonder what happened to the [Rocketboom being shown on TiVo](http://adverlab.blogspot.com/2006/06/tivo-shows-video-from-internet.html).    The rule, which Mr. Anderson knows full well, is that you don\u0026rsquo;t believe what people say about themselves, especially when they\u0026rsquo;re trying to sell something. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at some claims about the commercials and the viewership.\nIn October 2006 \u0026ldquo;Baron said he\u0026rsquo;s just done a deal worth $80,000 for a week of commercials in his videoblog. Claiming a daily audience of some 300,000 people, Baron could be getting more than a $55 CPM for his ads. You could get a discount, though. He\u0026rsquo;ll sell you a week of spots for $60,000 - if he likes the commercial content.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother commentator, Ze Frank, has challenged the Rocketboom numbers, noting some inconsistency in the figures Baron has reported over time:\n\"Rocketboom is watched by 350,000 people a day.\" April 21, 2006: Rolling Stone magazine [(link)](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9961735/the_rise_of_the_video_blog)     \"[Rocketboom's] audience is up about 100,000 the last month, to about 400,000 a day.\" August 10, 2006: Dow Jones MarketWatch [(link)](http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B98AB133E-4BB3-4ACB-BA24-1EC386E19F13%7D\u0026dist=rss\u0026siteid=mktw\u0026rss=1)     Q: \"Since Amanda left, have you seen any change in the audience?\" A: \"It's grown a bit.\" October 11, 2006: Future of PR Conference [(link)](http://www.valleywag.com/tech/rocketboom/unboomed-drew-baron-on-the-loss-of-his-bunny-206899.php)     \"...over 300,000 downloads per day.\" October 24, 2006 blog post [(link)](http://www.dembot.com/011160.html)    Businessweek\u0026rsquo;s Heather Green has chimed in too, suggesting that the October figure of \u0026ldquo;over 300,000 downloads\u0026rdquo; was an overestimate by about 50%. And how downloads translates into viewers is another issue entirely - does everyone watch to the end of the show, or do they drop it when a friend signs on to MSN? The picture - presented so breezily by Chris Anderson - is complex and obscure, and probably not nearly as dramatic as he makes it look.\nThe same problem appears elsewhere in Internet advertising-driven sites. There has been controversy over Second Life\u0026rsquo;s claims, nicely summarized by The Register\u0026rsquo;s Shaun Rudolph. There have been complaints about how difficult it is to cancel accounts created on a speculative whim at numerous sites - those account numbers translate into potential advertising money. And the effectiveness of web advertising itself is open to debate, with some serious estimates of \u0026ldquo;click fraud\u0026rdquo; being around 15% of all clicks - which translates into about $1 billion over charged to advertisers.\nSo - don\u0026rsquo;t trust self-reported numbers, especially if they support your thesis. Now on with the rest of the chapter.\nA Tail for the Taking [194-196] sets out the reason why Anderson sees TV as vulnerable to alternatives - there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of content, most of it not available to us for purely technological reasons, so \u0026ldquo;the ratio of produced content to available content is higher than in any other industry\u0026rdquo; [196]. It\u0026rsquo;s a good point, and to his credit he goes on to point out one of the problems - it\u0026rsquo;s not the technology, it\u0026rsquo;s the issue of rights, which is a rat\u0026rsquo;s nest. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to think that the Internet is doing away with old-fashioned laws - and it does challenge many - but let\u0026rsquo;s remember that Napster (the real Napster, that is) got beaten by the law. It\u0026rsquo;s not impotent yet.\nTV Outside the Box [196-197] suggests that new material on the Internet could more effectively challenge TV because the rights issues associated with old content are not so problematic. The section has a brief description of one such effort: Barrio305 - a web-only TV service for \u0026ldquo;urban Latin culture\u0026rdquo; [197] that each day \u0026ldquo;streams about 50,000 minutes of video to 5,000 unique users\u0026rdquo; [197] built on the Brightcove video distribution platform. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting story, but just a hint of one of many possible futures. Nothing definitive yet, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. And where do those figures come from? The book has no indication, in endnotes or anywhere else. In a recent interview the owners claim \u0026ldquo;about 10,000 viewers\u0026rdquo; daily. Who knows?\nShorter, Faster, Smaller [198-199] continues the argument in a small way. It points out that videos on the web are much smaller than TV shows\u0026rdquo; about 3 minutes instead of 30. Anderson thinks that the \u0026ldquo;arbitrary middle [of 30 minute shows] will not hold\u0026rdquo; [199]. So this is a nice setup for an argument. So now can we see some data\u0026hellip;\nHollywood @ Home [199-200] No we can\u0026rsquo;t. The chapter switches to \u0026ldquo;The other form of video that will be transformed in a Long Tail world is movies\u0026rdquo;. We\u0026rsquo;re done with TV apparently - like a 3 minute video the story was over before it got started. Is TV going to change? Sure. Will it go \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo;? Who knows?\nOne other point about this chapter. Given that Internet video is a different beast from TV - as he says here - maybe the comparison of TV to Internet video is not quite the right one when it comes to describing a change in culture. They both come at us through a screen, but if they are different things then the behaviour trend is not simply TV -\u0026gt; Internet video. There is also Books -\u0026gt; Internet video, and TV -\u0026gt; video games (a \u0026ldquo;Short Head\u0026rdquo; form of entertainment), and so on.\nIn looking at the way things change we have to forget the screen. It\u0026rsquo;s natural to think of things that come through monitors as being kind of like things that come through TV screens, but there are other ways to think. MySpace and Facebook, for example, are more about conversation than media. And if we want to call these forms of activity \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo; then let\u0026rsquo;s remember that the phone companies could be called the ultimate Long Tail business - capturing big company phone bills but making most of their money off those millions of little individual conversations (\u0026ldquo;verbal production?\u0026rdquo;) and making money off them because there are so many. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing new about providing a service to many people and making money off them. Oil companies make a lot of money selling to hundreds of millions of individual car owners.\nAs for movies, as Anderson points out, the way we watch them has expanded from movie theatres to TV, rented DVDs, and now downloaded movies onto hard drives, which will surely become more common in the next two or three years. With each expansion, the nature of the business changes. For Anderson, the complex development is a simple story:\nWhat the VCR and the video rental store hinted at was the rise of the age of infinite choice. Those stores increased the available selection of movies of any given Saturday night a hundredfold. Today, Netflix increases it a thousandfold. The Internet will increase it a gazillionfold. Every time a new technology enables more choice, whether it's the VCR or the Internet, consumers clamor for it. Choice is simply what we want and, apparently, what we've always wanted.    gazillionfold???\nThis big conclusion is speculation balanced on top of some very frail data in this chapter. As for whether choice is really \u0026ldquo;what we want and, apparently, what we\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted\u0026rdquo;, well someone could write a book about that.\n","date":1175127574,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"9044b497453514bddf7ba81f2132088b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_1_4/","publishdate":"2007-03-29T00:19:34Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_1_4/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 12 - The Infinite Screen.

Once I had picked myself up off the floor I thought I had to do something positive and decided in a moment of lucid thought that I would walk the Spey Way and try and raise some money for charity along the way. This is one of four designated long distance footpaths in Scotland and follows the course of the great River Spey from it's source in the Cairngorms to where it enters the Moray Firth (just down the road from where we now live, see photo opposite). More information from www.speysideway.org . I probably won't be able to do a Jayne Tomlinson but as long as I can put one foot in front of the other I will keep going (and even if I have to end it in a wheelchair I will). As Motor Neuron Disease is very close to my heart I would like to raise some money for them to do more research in to this little understood disease, and also Meningitis Research. This is a charity that we have done our little bit for over the years, our son Alex having survived its' ravages at an early age, and it would be good if we could raise some funds for them too. Walking will commence on the 3rd March, and don't worry I won't be galloping to the end! Your support, both monetary and in person if you can make it this far North, would be appreciated as it would be great to share some time together on this adventure. Donating through this site is simple, fast and totally secure. It is also the most efficient way to sponsor me: Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association will receive your money faster and, if you are a UK taxpayer, an extra 28% in tax will be added to your gift at no cost to you. So please sponsor me now! Many thanks for your support.    He also has a myspace page for the walk and there\u0026rsquo;s a newspaper story here.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t seen Tim in many years, but - if you read this Tim - when we were at school you seemed like one of the few people in our year who actually had it all together. At least, after you got rid of the Ziggy Stardust haircut. First, you had the rugby thing going. Then, you had the music thing going with Mike Parker and Jim Hogarth. And then you were dating Barbara Armstrong, who had emerged from some kind of an invisible cocoon she was hiding in for years to suddenly become attractive-and-outspoken-and-Oxford-bound Jo Armstrong.\nSo you managed to be one of the cool people in school without getting an attitude about it, and always seemed just as happy to spend time with those of us who were less cool as with those who were more so. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve carried on being as admirable - I\u0026rsquo;m sure you have. It\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a thing to get that diagnosis, but taking on the walk sounds like just the kind of thing you\u0026rsquo;d do - no messing, getting out and do something useful. Best wishes to you in the walk and everything else, my friend.\n","date":1174850773,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"e68f85a56a7fbc8d79d1984335b0b1bf","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/tims_spey_way_c/","publishdate":"2007-03-25T19:26:13Z","relpermalink":"/post/tims_spey_way_c/","section":"post","summary":"This post is for anyone who knew me from PHGS and who is as out of touch with people from school as I am.\nI went to Friends Reunited for the first time in ages to look through people\u0026rsquo;s entries, and was shocked to see that Tim Lester has recently been diagnosed with motor neuron disease.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nThe Rise of Massively Parallel Culture [182-185] reveals yet another of Chris Anderson\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses: as Editor of Wired Magazine in San Francisco he is surrounded by \u0026ldquo;geek friends\u0026rdquo; [182].\nThe Long Tail worldview is digital-optimist-libertarian, is characteristic of Silicon Valley - a culture called Cyberselfish in the book of the same name by Wired contributor Pauline Borsook. As The New York Times summarizes:\nMs. Borsook contends that many of the favorite arguments of technolibertarians come from ''bionomics'' -- that is, they like to use metaphors drawn from biology to explain economic behavior and endorse a decentralized free-market system. Reduced to a bumper slogan, Ms. Borsook writes, bionomics states that ''the economy is a rain forest''; in other words, it suggests that ''no one can manage or engineer a rain forest, and rain forests are happiest when they are left alone to evolve, which will then benefit all the happy monkeys, pretty butterflies and funny tapirs that live in them.''    Cyberselfish is a few years old now (but a good read nonetheless), and bionomics is a bit last-generation these days, but judging from The Long Tail not much has changed. The outlook is self-involved and, to be frank, self-important. Chris Anderson looks out from Silicon Valley at the rest of the world and doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a whole lot about it - and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t think it important to know about it. When he quotes Karl Marx [62] he doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually quote Marx, he quotes a report on digital technology by think tank Demos. The Long Tail is a book on culture with no reference to life outside the USA (except for anime videos). Chris Anderson sees no reason to pay attention to economists or social scientists (not a single economist who deals in the economics of information apart from his Berkeley neighbour Hal Varian, for example - no Stiglitz or Akerlof here), but calls essayist Clay Shirky \u0026ldquo;a prominent thinker\u0026rdquo;. He quotes his intellectual stablemates Richard Posner, Virginia Postrel, and George Gilder, and says James Surowiecki\u0026rsquo;s The Wisdom of Crowds - a quick read, but not deep - \u0026ldquo;needs to be read\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with quoting these people, but the contrast between his references to a certain kind of thinker from a certain kind of place and his complete neglect of so many other strands of thought is stark, especially in a book that does not claim any distinct political outlook.\nThis narrowness of vision is surely why he calls his own work \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo; even when he is discovering things well known by many others. He is an intellectual imperialist: Columbus \u0026ldquo;discovering\u0026rdquo; America all over again - thinkers from outside his own intellectual neighbourhood just don\u0026rsquo;t count. The people who endorse the book are of course, as already pointed out, a coterie of Silicon Valley digerati (and the aforementioned Mr. Surowiecki).\nThe outlook of the author and the audience for the book come through in the terminology he uses. \u0026ldquo;Massively parallel\u0026rdquo; is a computing term - elsewhere he\u0026rsquo;s all, like, \u0026ldquo;impedance mismatch\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;fractal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;network economics\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;meme\u0026rdquo; - the buzzwords of computer engineers and the Santa Fe Institute.\nGiven this outlook, it is not surprising that it takes Mr. Anderson just a couple of pages of sketchy story telling - references to a bunch of Internet \u0026ldquo;viral memes\u0026rdquo; such as Dancing Babies and the truly disgusting \u0026ldquo;goatse\u0026rdquo; picture - before he can conclude that the online world - his world - is far more diverse than the world outside his valley. \u0026ldquo;In short, we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a shift from mass culture to massively parallel culture.\u0026rdquo; [184] He claims that, while the diversity of humanity \u0026ldquo;has always been true, but it\u0026rsquo;s only now something that we can act on. The resulting rise of niche culture will reshape the social landscape. People are re-forming into thousands of cultural tribes of interest, connected less by geographic proximity and workplace chatter than by shared interests.\u0026rdquo; [184] The narrowness of his own intellectual horizons, and the proportion of his influences that hail from California, suggest that this is less true than he would like to think.\nYochai Benkler is an interesting writer who Anderson pays attention to, although not in The Long Tail. Benkler has a much better picture of the way that the online shift is changing our culture, and what happens when \u0026ldquo;people shift their attention online\u0026rdquo; [181]. The picture he gives (Chapter 10 of The Wealth of Networks) documents that the online world is not one of \u0026ldquo;virtual communities\u0026rdquo; heralded by the optimists, and is not one of isolation and alienation feared by the pessimists. Instead, he argues that users \u0026ldquo;increase their connections with preexisting relations\u0026rdquo; [363] and leads to \u0026ldquo;weak ties\u0026rdquo; of networked individuals (rather than the stronger ties implied by the word \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo;) in the new relationships that we form. There is little indication of \u0026ldquo;tribes of interest\u0026rdquo;, with the close ties that the phrase suggests, emerging online.\nThe section ends with a rare quote from an intellectual outside Anderson\u0026rsquo;s usual sphere of influence: \u0026ldquo;In 1958, Raymond williams, the Marxist sociologist, wrote in Culture and Society: \u0026lsquo;There are no masses; there are only ways of seeing people as masses.\u0026rsquo; He was more right than he knew.\u0026rdquo; [185] Now maybe he means something other than the way I read this, but the sentence strikes me as remarkably arrogant. To assert that Williams, a first-rank thinker and hugely influential in our understanding of the ways that culture and society influence each other, was \u0026ldquo;more right than he knew\u0026rdquo; is not only patronizing, but patronizing in an innapropriate, almost embarrassing way given the relative intellectual standing of the two.\nIf the New Fits [185-189] is about blogs - a truly interesting development (especially for us bloggers). He focuses on two influential blogs (from the short head?): Daily Kos and Instapundit and points out that they are influential. As I argued in the notes to Chapter 5, he will get no argument from me that the development of social software as a platform for both publishing and conversation, is an important development - but it ain\u0026rsquo;t Long Tail.\nA Million Little Pieces [189-191] starts off by asking if a \u0026ldquo;fragmented culture [is] better or worse culture\u0026rdquo;? [189], and raises the question of whether the digital world may be a place where \u0026ldquo;you need not come across topics and view that you have not sought out.\u0026rdquo; [189] - creating a polarized world of insular thought where, as he quotes Christine Rosen, \u0026ldquo;we are, ironically, finding it increasingly difficult to appreciate genuine individuality\u0026rdquo; [190]. Anderson asks \u0026ldquo;Is Rosen right? I suspect not\u0026rdquo; [190] and then goes on a little idealistic detour that wanders between a paean to the openness and diversity of the online world. It is easy to agree with the statement that \u0026ldquo;Fundamentally, a society that asks questions and has the power to answer them is a healthier society than one that simply accepts what it\u0026rsquo;s told from a narrow range of experts and institutions\u0026rdquo; [191], but less easy to see what it has to do with the Long Tail - a tale where our access to variety is channelled through a small number of aggregators whose recommendation systems are private and hidden - a narrow range of (machine-based) experts and institutions indeed.\nHis optimism is engaging: \u0026ldquo;I suspect that over time the power of human curiosity combined with near infinite access to information will tend to make most people more open-minded, not less\u0026rdquo; [191]. To dispute this seems Luddite in the colloquial sense - actual Luddites being admirable, or at lease understandable, and Scrooge-like. But one can see opportunities in the Internet - real innovation, of real novelty, and real social changes - without subscribing to The Long Tail\u0026rsquo;s particular muddled vision of commercial giants and social software platforms.\n","date":1174686306,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"382fe772e9faa69ccafec170e5c2000e","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_1_3/","publishdate":"2007-03-23T21:45:06Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_1_3/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses the second half of Chapter 11 - Living in a Niche Culture.

You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re getting towards the end of the book now, and it is moving on from the core material to some speculative asides about broader issues. The material in this chapter illustrates the reasons for the book\u0026rsquo;s success and also one of its most pervasive weaknesses - which is all about the meaning of the title. Throughout the book, Chris Anderson uses the phrase \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail\u0026rdquo; to mean several different things.\n It\u0026rsquo;s a business model (create a profitable business by \u0026ldquo;selling less of more\u0026rdquo;)\n It\u0026rsquo;s a commentary on the benefits of Internet commerce (online commerce is more diverse than those old physical shelves)\n It\u0026rsquo;s a trendspotting book about changes to contemporary culture (the end of the hit parade, the fall of the blockbuster)\n  The shift back and forth between these different meanings is what makes the book so frustrating. Anderson wants to eat his cake and have it too - which is the theme for this posting.\nWhen it suits, Anderson can be very cautious about what he means by \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail\u0026rdquo;. Witness two entries in his blog. First, here\u0026rsquo;s part of his response to Lee Gomes\u0026rsquo;s article, which I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned a few times:\nFirst, the book doesn't claim that there are any cases where sales of products _not_ available in the dominant bricks-and-mortar retailer in a sector (my definition of \"tail\") are larger than the sales of products that _are_ available in that retailer (\"head\")... Which is why the language Gomes cites from the book jacket is actually all phrased in the future conditional tense (\"What happens when the combined value of all the millions of items that may sell only a few copies equals or exceeds the value of a few items that sell millions each?\").    That \u0026ldquo;future conditional\u0026rdquo; thing is really a bit precious isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nOr here, in a post he calls What The Long Tail Isn\u0026rsquo;t:\nThere are many distortions of the term, but the most common one is to use it as a newly-positive synonym for \"fringe\"... for Long Tail effects to work, you need both a head of relatively few hits _and_ a tail of many niches, so that recommendations and other filters can lead consumers from one to the other.     A tail without a head is too noisy and apparently random to get consumer traction; people need to start with the familiar and then move, via trusted recommendations, to the unfamiliar. Likewise a head without a tail is too limited in choice; the odds of finding a niche you want are too low to bother exploring much beyond what you already know.     Thus the two big Long Tail opportunities are:     1. Aggregating hits and niches into a one big curve, from head to tail.   2. Creating content and products that can plug into someone else's aggregated curve.   He goes on to list some other things that \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail Isn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo;:\n Commodification - The LT is about nicheification, which is different.\n Simple variety\n Offering a few different choices or a bit of customization (like the sandwich filling options in the risible example above) is not enough. Long Tail effects kick in when you\u0026rsquo;re expanding variety and choice by orders of magnitude\u0026ndash;from 10x to infinity.\n The case for an all amateur, self-published future  The LT will probably have as much commercial content as ever. It will just be joined by far more amateur fare, forming a relatively seamless continuum from pros to ams.\n The actual end of hits  The LT ends the tyranny of hits, shifting the market equally to niches. But it certainly acknowledges that some things will continue to be a lot more popular than others. Powerlaw distributions are as natural as diversity itself.\n A focus on small markets at the exclusion of large ones - Again, you need both hits _and** **_niches to allow the filters and recommendation engines to work, driving demand down the curve from the known to the unknown.\n Just any powerlaw\n  Powerlaws are ubiquitous. Long Tails are not. The first shows up anywhere you have variety, inequality, and network effects (word of mouth). The second requires massive variety and a wide range between the hits and niches. After all, many short tails are simply truncated powerlaw distributions. They just aren\u0026rsquo;t, er, long.\n  Mr. Anderson wants to have it both ways.\nHe wants to disown the wilder uses of his catch phrase, ignoring the fact that the catchiness is the core of its popularity and influence. Also, he is not immune to misusing the phrase himself. He wants to say that \u0026ldquo;offering a few choices or a bit of customization\u0026rdquo; is not Long Tail - yet he writes about twenty varieties of flour as the \u0026ldquo;Long Tail of flour\u0026rdquo; [11], or customized T-shirts as the \u0026ldquo;Long Tail of fashion \u0026rdquo; [50]. He disowns \u0026ldquo;a focus on small markets at the exclusion of large ones\u0026rdquo;, and yet writes that microbreweries are the \u0026ldquo;Long Tail of beer\u0026rdquo; [50]. He says that \u0026ldquo;just any powerlaw\u0026rdquo; is not a long tail and yet describes cities as \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail of urban space\u0026rdquo; [150] and Al Qaeda as \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail of national security\u0026rdquo; [50]? If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for the aura of universality that such misuses create then the thesis of the book would have attracted much less attention than it has.\nThe first section of Chapter 11 is about The History of House Sound of Chicago, a book by Stuart Cosgrove. The emergence of this form of music in the early 1980s, from the embers of disco, is the story of a \u0026ldquo;proto-Long Tail music culture\u0026rdquo; [177]. Mr. Anderson backs up the claim by reference to the three forces of the Long Tail from Chapter 4:\n \u0026ldquo;It started with the spread of affordable technology, from mixing decks to multitrack recorders. That\u0026rsquo;s the first force of the Long Tail, the democratization of the tools of production.\u0026rdquo; [178]\n An explosion of records created the need for a way for people to get to them: \u0026ldquo;Which is exactly what clubs and warehouse parties offered, thus providing the necessary second force \u0026ndash; democratized distribution\u0026rdquo; [179]\n The \u0026ldquo;hyperspecialized genres\u0026rdquo; of house music were identified by a proliferation of distinct record labels, sometimes owned by the same company: \u0026ldquo;Indie record labels are like tags, providing clues to which microgenre a track is likely to be\u0026rdquo; [179]. This \u0026ldquo;connects supply and demand\u0026rdquo; which is his third force.\n  Does Chicago House music have anything to do with the Long Tail? Well, what I know about House music could fit on a single 45rpm label, but the answer is clearly No.\nThe story of the House Sound of Chicago is a familiar story about the emergence of a subculture in a particular physical place and time - it is an example of variety and minority-interest culture emerging from the very offline, physical proximity whose limitations he decries in the remainder of the book.\nLooking back at the criteria for something to be Long Tail, there is nothing here about either \u0026ldquo;Aggregating hits and niches into a one big curve, from head to tail\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Creating content and products that can plug into someone else\u0026rsquo;s aggregated curve.\u0026rdquo; Whereas Anderson claims that The Long Tail is not \u0026ldquo;a focus on small markets at the exclusion of large ones\u0026rdquo;, the indie music he is invoking did just that. As for his \u0026ldquo;three forces\u0026rdquo;: folk music in the broadest sense has always been produced by cheap technology, from harmonicas to fiddles to guitars to whistles, so there is nothing new there. Using clubs and parties as a way to share and provide access to music? Been done for hundreds or thousands of years. And the idea of labels as being \u0026ldquo;like tags\u0026rdquo; is simply a way of relating the culture of music to the culture his core audience is familiar with, which is the online computer world.\nElsewhere, Anderson laments that the physical world limits cultural diversity because of what we might call the Bollywood Problem: culture that appeals to a specific group of widely dispersed people has to reach a certain threshold of appeal in a single locale before being viable, and so might be viable nowhere (well, in North America anyway). One of the many things he neglects about the cultural phenomena at the core of his book is the fact that much of culture is not a \u0026ldquo;market\u0026rdquo; with distinct supply and demand. Culture as a participatory activity involves an intermingling of supply and demand, and it is precisely the specific nature of physical environments that leads to the development of new genres and flavours of music, whether it\u0026rsquo;s Northern Soul or the collectivist music ethic that started in Montreal with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and has now given us the snow-influenced best band in the world and has also travelled down the 401 to Toronto to produce the almost-great Broken Social Scene.\nFrom \u0026ldquo;Or\u0026rdquo; Culture to \u0026ldquo;And\u0026rdquo; Culture [180-182] continues with the big statements that Anderson disowns elsewhere, starting off with \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail is nothing more than infinite choice\u0026rdquo; [180]. Once people get on the internet \u0026ldquo;they don\u0026rsquo;t just go from one media outlet to another \u0026ndash; they simply scatter. Infinite choice equals ultimate fragmentation\u0026rdquo; [181]. Yet he simultaneously wants to say that this is \u0026ldquo;simply a rebalancing of the equation, an evolution from an \u0026lsquo;Or\u0026rsquo; era of hits or niches (mainstream culture vs. subcultures) to an \u0026lsquo;And\u0026rsquo; era\u0026hellip; Mass culture will not fall, it will simply get less mass.\u0026rdquo; [182]\nSo if \u0026ldquo;Mass culture will not fall\u0026rdquo; and the Long Tail is not \u0026ldquo;The actual end of hits\u0026rdquo; then why does he entitle a chapter \u0026ldquo;The Rise and Fall of the Hit\u0026rdquo;, or title sections \u0026ldquo;Who Killed the Hit Album?\u0026rdquo; [33] or \u0026ldquo;The End of the Hit Parade\u0026rdquo; [31]? or write \u0026ldquo;We are turning from a mass market back into a niche nation\u0026rdquo; [40]. Parsing \u0026ldquo;The End of the Hit Parade\u0026rdquo; carefully (there is no tense, not even future conditional), you could argue that ending the Hit Parade is different from Hits themselves, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say, in a book as rhetorical as this one, the author is out to create an impression that we are on the edge of a bigger transition than a mere rebalancing of the equation.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to say that Mr. Anderson needs to make up his mind, but plainly he doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to at all. The ability to switch back and forth between eschatology and business models is what gives the book its appeal, and he\u0026rsquo;s done very well by it. The fact that it is inconsistent to the point of foolishness appears not to matter. Too bad.\n","date":1174666812,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f3cdf1b17f4450916a97a237122e4e17","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_1_2-2/","publishdate":"2007-03-23T16:20:12Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_1_2-2/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses the first part of Chapter 11 - Living in a Niche Culture.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to counter \u0026ldquo;the notion that \u0026lsquo;too much choice\u0026rsquo; is overwhelming, a belief so common and ill-founded that it deserves its own chapter\u0026rdquo; [167].\nThe last 50 years have seen \u0026ldquo;an explosion of variety\u0026rdquo; [169], which Anderson ascribes to three factors. The first is \u0026ldquo;globalization and the hyperefficient supply chains it brings\u0026rdquo;; the second is the change in the population - in the US, he mentions ethnic diversity and increasing affluence, leading to a cultural shift from \u0026ldquo;I want to be normal\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I want to be special\u0026rdquo;; the third is The Long Tail - or the proliferation of variety brought about by iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, and eBay.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s variety and then there\u0026rsquo;s variety. Grocery shopping is often a focus for this kind of discussion (and the book uses it in the next section) so let\u0026rsquo;s use supermarkets as a way into the topic. For me, the proliferation of options at the cheese counter is a great thing: the range of options there seems to me a real variety. On the other hand, the toothpaste section (over forty different types of toothpaste) does not seem to be real variety. Now this could just be me, who likes cheese and can\u0026rsquo;t really be bothered about toothpaste as long as it does the job, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s more than that. There is another difference between the two, and it\u0026rsquo;s the issue of manufacturers or suppliers. The cheese counter contains products from a variety of producers, while the toothpaste shelves contain products mainly from two producers - Colgate-Palmolive has 37% of the American market; Procter \u0026amp; Gamble (makers of Crest and now merged with Gillette) follow with 34% - with a few \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo; players like GlaxoSmithKline (Aquafresh) and Unilever filling out the remainder. If anything, the toothpaste market has become more dominated over the years by this small number of companies; meanwhile, the profusion of items on the shelf is growing. Oligopoly Watch (from a few years ago) describes these twin trends of corporate consolidation and product profusion in the world of toothpaste. Is the combination an increase or a decrease in real \u0026ldquo;choice\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;variety\u0026rdquo;?\nAnderson is as ebulliently optimistic as ever that the increase in number of products is simply a reflection of what we consumers want - \u0026ldquo;More choice really is better\u0026rdquo; [174], but very well-known research by Richard Schmalensee showed that the proliferation of toothpaste varieties may have little to do with responding to consumer demand, and be more about preventing other companies from getting a foothold in the market. Back in 1978 he looked at the ready-to-eat breakfast cereal market, where six companies dominated the market and introduced eighty different brands between 1950 and 1972 - more choice, for sure. Now Schmalensee is no radical - he was on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s team in their anti-trust suit, arguing that Microsoft is not a monopoly - but he concluded that this particular case of product proliferation was all about trying to deter entry by other companies. The strategy is to \u0026ldquo;pack the product space and leave no profitable niche unfilled\u0026rdquo; (this from the standard graduate text by Tirole, p. 346). Schmalensee showed \u0026ldquo;how a cartel (a group of firms that act as a single monopolist) crowds a product space\u0026rdquo;. The cartel in this case needs no explicit collusion, but the strategies of the incumbent firms complement each other to produce the same effect as a monopoly. The result - higher prices for consumers, as the incumbent firms can raise prices without new competitors coming to undercut them.\nHow much of the \u0026ldquo;explosion of variety\u0026rdquo; that we have experienced is real variety, and how much is entry deterrence and the ability to raise prices? It requires a lot more space and expertise than I have to pick apart what\u0026rsquo;s what in the myriad of different retail spaces, but it is something to think about when standing in front of a wall of shampoo, deodorant, mustard, breakfast cereal, or whatever. One would think that if The Long Tail is, among other things, an \u0026ldquo;economics research project\u0026rdquo; [11] and \u0026ldquo;a preview of 21st century economics\u0026rdquo; [11] then its author might have looked a little harder at the work of actual economists, however 20th century they might be.\nToo Much Choice? [170-172] is a quick summary of one of the points made in Barry Schwartz\u0026rsquo;s excellent book The Paradox of Choice. It describes one well-known experiment that Schwartz talks about on pages 19-20, carried out originally by Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University. The experimenters set up a table at a specialty food store and offered customers a taste of a range of jams, and a $1 coupon to use against the purchase of a jam. When only 6 jams were put on the table, 30 percent of customers went on to buy a jar of jam; when 24 jams were put on the table, only 3 percent did. Faced with extra options, people shied away from choosing any of them. After presenting the experiment, Anderson goes on to say:\nSchwartz describes the conclusion this way:     As the number of choices keeps growing, negative aspects of having a multitude of options begin to appear. As the number of choices grows further, the negatives escalate until we become overloaded. At this point, choice no longer liberates, but debilitates. It might even be said to tyrannize.    I found those sentences on page 2 of the book (The Long Tail does not indicate where they came from - it\u0026rsquo;s endnotes are lousy). They are separate from the jam experiment (pp 19-20). Schwartz\u0026rsquo;s book addresses a broad range of questions about the proliferation of choices that we are faced with, and while the sentences do reflect an argument that Schwartz makes, it oversimplifies his reaction to this particular experiment.\nAnderson\u0026rsquo;s response to Schwarts is to say:\nI'm skeptical. The alternative to letting people choose is choosing for them. The lessons of a century of retail science (along with the history of Soviet department stores) are that this is not what most consumers want [171].    His rebuttal does not do justice to The Paradox of Choice. Two sentences before the convenient quotation above, Schwartz says \u0026ldquo;When people have no choice, life is almost unbearable\u0026rdquo;, and a few sentences after them he says \u0026ldquo;Choice is essential to autonomy, which is absolutely fundamental to well-being. Healthy people want and need to direct their own lives\u0026rdquo;. So Schwartz is clearly not advocating Soviet department stores here, or the elimination of personal choice. The suggestion that the only options are \u0026ldquo;letting people choose\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;choosing for them\u0026rdquo; is a silly false dichotomy that I got accused of with my book too. There are many forms of choice, from individual consumer choice to our choices as citizens to collective choices - not just \u0026ldquo;choosing for them\u0026rdquo;. Anderson is substituting a quick dig for real argument. It\u0026rsquo;s weak. But then, Schwartz\u0026rsquo;s book is detailed, subtle, and packed full of references to work by other people\u0026hellip;\nIn fact, Schwartz\u0026rsquo;s book is more about how to cope with the profusion of choice than advocating a removal of it. One of eleven recommendations he makes is to \u0026ldquo;satisfice\u0026rdquo;, but Anderson ignores the other ten and says: \u0026ldquo;Schwartz recommends that consumers \u0026lsquo;satisfice,\u0026rsquo; in the jargon of social science, not \u0026lsquo;maximize\u0026rsquo;. In other words, they\u0026rsquo;d be happier if they just settled for what was in front of them rather than obsessing over whether something else might be even better\u0026rdquo; [171]. Contrast this with Schwartz\u0026rsquo;s actual definition of \u0026ldquo;satisfice\u0026rdquo; (p78):\nTo satisfice is to settle for something that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better. A satisficer has criteria and standards. She searches until she finds an item that meets those standards, and at that point, she stops.    I don\u0026rsquo;t think Anderson\u0026rsquo;s paraphrase is a fair one, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think his arguments refute much of The Paradox of Choice. (They also don\u0026rsquo;t even start addressing most of the problems that are the subject of No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart, but that\u0026rsquo;s another story).\nVariety is Not Enough [172-175] starts out by refuting Iyengar\u0026rsquo;s jam experiment. Anderson wrote to Iyengar and asked \u0026ldquo;why the people who should actually know the most about consumer choice in a supermarket were ignoring their [Iyengar and coworkers\u0026rsquo;] conclusions\u0026rdquo; [172]. He summarizes her reply (and a work in progress [PDF download]) as \u0026ldquo;The solution, they found, is to order the choice in ways that actually help the consumers\u0026rdquo; [173]. And with this, Anderson\u0026rsquo;s faith in limitless choice restored and he is off to find out how online resellers manage to guide people through their choices.\nBut just as Schwartz is more nuanced than Anderson gives him credit for, so Iyengar and coworkers are more nuanced in their conclusions. They distinguish \u0026ldquo;Preference Constructors\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;Preference Matchers\u0026rdquo;. Preference Matchers are often experienced with the particular choice they are faced with (choosing a cup of Starbucks coffee is one they discuss); they are \u0026ldquo;someone who enters the decision making task looking for either a specific option or an option that possesses a number of pre-defined attributes. This type of chooser restricts the multitude of available options in a purchasing situation by creating “consideration sets,” or sets of options with a high probability of containing his or her optimal choice\u0026rdquo;. Meanwhile \u0026ldquo;Preference Constructors\u0026rdquo; are those approaching the choice for the first time. Faced with a dizzying array (24 jams) such a chooser may shy away. They can be helped by providing some guidance: \u0026ldquo;To enable Preference Constructors to distinguish a hazelnut steamer from a vanilla chai and thus successfully form their preference criteria before identifying their preferred option, these decision makers may require more than a limitless, unstructured choice set.\u0026rdquo; Here is the basis for Anderson\u0026rsquo;s optimism.\nHis contention is that online retailers are ideally placed to guide you through the choice in a comfortable way, so that us consumers are not faced with the 24-jam problem. But I\u0026rsquo;m just an old cynic. Whereas Chris Anderson is thankful for all this guidance he\u0026rsquo;s getting, I\u0026rsquo;m just suspicious. As George Akerlof wrote (and he knows about people guiding you through choices), the problem goes back as far as horse trading: \u0026ldquo;“if he wants to sell that horse, do I really want to buy it?” Such questioning is fundamental to the market for horses and used cars, but it is also at least minimally present in every market transaction.\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s Anderson\u0026rsquo;s take on how online retailers can guide people through a proliferation of choices.\nThere are a nearly infinite number [nitpick alert: \"nearly infinite\"??? - TS] of techniques to tap the latent information in a marketplace and make that selection process easier. You can sort by price, by ratings, by date, and by genre. You can read customer reviews. You can compare prices across products and, if you want, head off to Google to find out as much about the product as you can imagine. Recommendations suggest products that 'people like you' have been buying, and surprisingly enough, they're often on-target. Even if you know nothing about the category, ranking best-sellers will reveal the most popular choice, which both makes selection easier and also tends to minimize post-sale regret. After all, if everyone else picked a given product, it can't be that bad. [173]    I confess I did a double-take when I read that paragraph. The first half is confusing: is the goal of \u0026ldquo;supplementing an unstructured choice set\u0026rdquo; really accomplished by adding to that bewildering array a second bewildering array of different techniques to find out bits and pieces about the merits of different choices? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. And the second half is a concise argument as to why online retailers so often fail to drive demand down to The Long Tail - in direct contrast to what he claims elsewhere. Anything that gets people to choose an item just because other people have chosen it leads to increasing returns. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen it, it will be recommended to other people because you bought it, and so on. Note that without recommendations, you can\u0026rsquo;t even tell if they liked it or not once they bought it. And pointing people to best sellers because \u0026ldquo;it can\u0026rsquo;t be all that bad\u0026rdquo;? This is the logic of the blockbuster. Nevertheless, Anderson is so pleased with his conclusion that he reiterates it three times: \u0026ldquo;More choice really is better\u0026hellip; The paradox of choice turned out to be more about the poverty of help in making that choice than a rejection of plenty. Order it wrong and choice is oppressive; order it right and it\u0026rsquo;s liberating\u0026rdquo; [174].\nThe other argument that Anderson has in favour of unrestricted choice is taken from libertarian journalist Virginia Postrel, and is again about help. It is true that, around most choices that are both expensive and complex, an industry of brokers rises up. Real estate agents, wedding planners, financial planners and so on, all \u0026ldquo;help us be ourselves\u0026rdquo; [174]. Another way of looking at such an industry is that it represents the cost of choosing (wedding planners are not free, after all): the rise of such an industry indicates that there is a cost to choice that we are prepared to pay substantially for, but this is in itself neither an argument for or against the proliferation of variety and pseudo-variety that we are immersed in.\nThe Economics of Variety [175-176] finishes the chapter by asking \u0026ldquo;Does more choice encourage consumers to buy more?\u0026rdquo; [175], and concluding that, by making choices easier, digital distribution \u0026ldquo;widens the field of possible customers and shortens the search time. Over time, this should increase sales and grow the overall market. As we saw in Chapter 8, longer tails can be thicker too\u0026rdquo; [176].\nI\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure what he means here by \u0026ldquo;the overall market\u0026rdquo;, but if he is claiming - as I think he is - that the overall economy will grow because people will buy more stuff, then this is a claim that needs a lot of substantiation. The money, after all, has to come from somewhere. Unless he is advocating a further increase in consumer debt as a way of boosting the overall economy, then I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what his argument is.\nBut then that\u0026rsquo;s how I feel about the whole book, of course. The Long Tail sounds nice, and it would be great if online retail could not only break the tyranny of the blockbuster and promote a diverse niche culture, but also boost the economy at the same time - but just because it would be nice doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it so, and the book continues to fail to convince.\n","date":1174253685,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d59d96a17f41ab743a4361a7547db0ec","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_1-2/","publishdate":"2007-03-18T21:34:45Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_1-2/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 10 - The Paradise of Choice.

It\u0026rsquo;s an odd place for it in the book - this reads like a part of Chapter 7 - The New Tastemakers that has wandered into the wrong part of the book by mistake. Warning - this is even more rambling than the other posts in the series: it is more of a set of half-baked thoughts than a coherent thesis. But hey, this is a blog.\nIn the Library of Misshelved Books [156-160] starts off this way: \u0026ldquo;One of the most vexing problems with physical goods is that they force us into crude categorization and static taxonomies, as we saw with Wal-Mart. That means a windbreaker can be in the \u0026lsquo;Jackets\u0026rsquo; section or the \u0026lsquo;Sports\u0026rsquo; section, but not in a \u0026lsquo;Blue\u0026rsquo; section or \u0026lsquo;Nylon\u0026rsquo; section\u0026rdquo; [156]. A thing has to be in one place or another but not both, and so can be difficult to find. In the online world, things can be in many places at once, and this opens new doors: \u0026ldquo;The efficiency and success of online retail have illuminated the cost of traditional retail\u0026rsquo;s inflexibility and taxonomical oversimplification. It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to have high prices or limited selection; it\u0026rsquo;s quite another to simply be able to help people find what they want\u0026rdquo;. [157]\nDespite this start, the section is mainly about libraries. It describes the Dewey Decimal System for organizing books and its cultural biases and limitations. The numbers from 200 to 300, for example, are \u0026ldquo;Religion\u0026rdquo;, but all religions apart from Christianity are lumped into the interval from 290 to 300. But although the cultural bias of the Dewey Decimal System is clear, its practical consequences are small because, as any library aficionado knows, the Dewey Decimal System goes on several places past the decimal point. As a result you can fit as many books between 290 and 300 as in any other interval, because The Long Tail, for example, is \u0026ldquo;658.802 And\u0026rdquo;; No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart is \u0026ldquo;306.123 Sle\u0026rdquo;. Anyone who has spent time in a library knows there are some areas where the numbers fly by and others where there are whole shelves that have the same number up to the second decimal place. But that\u0026rsquo;s OK, because additional numbers are free: you could say that the Dewey Decimal System exploits the free shelf space of numbers to extend into the Long Tail of digits. (Aaargh! I have to give Anderson this - the phrase is very infectious.) But anyway, once you have a number for a book, finding it on a shelf is rarely difficult and that\u0026rsquo;s the point.\nShopping in the Miscellaneous Aisle [160-162] starts off by admitting this: \u0026ldquo;In libraries, at least there is a standard categorization scheme \u0026ndash; the card catalog is there to be searched, and librarians tend to know their stuff\u0026rdquo; [160]. Haven\u0026rsquo;t seen a card catalog in a while, but it is good to know that Chris Anderson and I agree there is little problem with libraries. So where is there a problem?\nWell, it\u0026rsquo;s retail stores: those nylon jackets. And it\u0026rsquo;s true that it can be difficult finding things from time to time (wandering around Toys-R-Us with two pre-school kids was my worst experience, I think). But while this is a section I actually have more agreement with than most in the book, Anderson sets us up again. He complains how difficult it was to look for the Japanese anime classic \u0026ldquo;Akira\u0026rdquo; in a Blockbuster store, but \u0026ldquo;As it turned out, it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter - they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the film\u0026rdquo; [161]. He contrasts this experience with Amazon, where he types the title into the search bar and gets right to the film immediately, along with recommendations for other films. He also says all films were \u0026ldquo;in stock and cheaper than Blockbuster. The experience I had with these two stores couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more different\u0026rdquo; [161] . He is exaggerating again. This section is about locating things, and if you are searching for something not in stock, then it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising you don\u0026rsquo;t find it.\nBut let me give credit where credit is due. The access methods that Amazon has built into its site are very impressive and increasingly sophisticated. As examples I looked for two obscure songs: Ken Boothe\u0026rsquo;s 1972 \u0026ldquo;Freedom Street\u0026rdquo; and Fontella Bass\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;To Be Free\u0026rdquo; (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember the title and had to browse) and found both quickly, complete with sound sample; I also tried to cheat by looking up \u0026ldquo;The The\u0026rdquo; - a band with the worst possible name in a Google-dominated world (try finding them) - but Amazon tracked them down.\nIf the thing you are looking for is a digital product (a category that is growing rapidly, including songs, beginning to include movies and books) then Amazon can take you to it. But if the thing you are looking for is not digital, as in Anderson\u0026rsquo;s example in Chapter 10 of looking for jam, then Amazon can\u0026rsquo;t take you to the product itself. It can take you to an image of it, and written material about it, but sometimes these are not enough. The virtual shelf is somewhere in between an actual shelf and a card catalogue. Some of the items on the virtual shelf are actual items, and others are cards that tell you \u0026ldquo;we can send you what\u0026rsquo;s described here\u0026rdquo;.\nAn area not covered by Anderson is browsing - which is what many of us do when looking through music stores, bookstores, or video stores. Amazon is doing wonders improving its browsing experience (the ability to look inside the book being an obvious example), but it is still struggling uphill, I would say.\nThe Tyranny of Geography [162-164] returns to one of the book\u0026rsquo;s original claims, that geography limits variety: \u0026ldquo;in the tyranny of physical space, an audience too thinly spread is the same as no audience at all. Thus, local demand must be a a high enough concentration to compensate for the high costs of physical distribution. In other, more obvious words, not enough local demand equals no store\u0026rdquo; [163]. The shortfalls in this argument - the various workarounds that we employ, the role of cities in providing that variety and of communities in passing niche products around - were already highlighted by piefuchs in a comment on Chapter 2. It\u0026rsquo;s not that there\u0026rsquo;s no truth to Anderson\u0026rsquo;s claims, but it\u0026rsquo;s just irritating that he stacks the deck in his own argument\u0026rsquo;s favour even here. When looking at the restrictions on physical stores, he sets out the calculation of sales they can make this way [163]:\nSales =\nThe percentage of the population who might buy\nMinus\nThe percentage not within ten miles of the store\nMinus\nThe percentage that never comes in\nMinus\nThe percentage that won\u0026rsquo;t see the item on the shelf\nAnd so on\u0026hellip;\nBut for some specialist stores in big cities, it could be like this:\nSales =\nThe percentage of the city population who might buy\nPlus\nThose from surrounding towns who come in every now and then\nPlus\nThose who phone in special orders\nPlus\nThose whose relatives pick up something for them while they are in town\nAnd so on\u0026hellip;\nVariety in the physical world is, as discussed earlier, much more uneven than in the online world. This heterogeneous nature of the physical world does have some other benefits. A place that is a centre for jazz music stores is also likely to be a centre for jazz clubs in the evening, and to be a place where jazz musicians as well as jazz audiences tend to aggregate. The benefits of such cultural centres spill over from the consumption of culture into the production of culture, and then into the invention of new forms of culture. So while it is true that, just like catalogue shopping increased variety in a convenient way to small-town residents in years past, so online retailers \u0026ldquo;can reach all those many low-density towns as efficiently as the high-density ones, they can tap the Long Tail of distributed demand\u0026rdquo; [163-164], it is also true that the homogeneity of the online retail world may erode the vitality of those cultural centres that create the culture they sell.\nThe same is true - even more so - when it comes to international culture. The online world reaches small countries with the same ease that it reaches big countries, and promises to even out consumer access to cultural goods around the world. But this will do little to even out the production of cultural variety, because cultural variety is a product of the lumpiness of our world. It is the uneven concentrations of people, the barriers between one place and another \u0026ndash; the fact that we are all isolated, to some degree, from people elsewhere in the world and so have to grow within our own communities \u0026ndash; that lead to cultural diversity, whether its the brass bands of coal mining towns in the North of England or cajun cooking or the Milan opera. Various forms of cultural protection - subsidies to cultural industries, restrictions on imports, national content regulations - have been successfully used all around the world to promote local culture, and so to maintain diversity in the face of economies of scale.\nCultural protection has something of a bad reputation these days. Opponents argue that any culture worth its salt will prosper in a global market, but such an argument neglects the economics of cultural goods, where marginal cost is zero. Any revenue that an American TV show sold to a smaller market gains is gravy for its producers, and as a result American shows will typically be far cheaper for TV stations to broadcast than local fare. Again, cultural production is caught in a vice, with one jaw being those economies of scale driving production geared \u0026ldquo;for an international audience\u0026rdquo; and the other jaw being the online world, where endless variety is present in principle but not always in practice.\nSkipping ahead a little, Anderson complains that \u0026ldquo;the Long Tail doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lobby, so all too often only the Short Head is heard\u0026rdquo; [167] in legislation of the Internet. But the Long Tail does have a lobby - all those national cultural industries lobbying for the promotion of local culture are part of a struggling Long Tail - but it\u0026rsquo;s not a lobby that gets much support from the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who praise Anderson\u0026rsquo;s book. This should remind us that if we are looking for a route to a \u0026ldquo;niche driven culture\u0026rdquo; then Amazon and Netflix and Rhapsody and Apple\u0026rsquo;s iTunes are not the people we should be looking to as guides to take us there.\nScarce Air [164-166] is a return to another earlier topic: broadcast radio and TV. It adds little to the discussion in Chapter 2. Only one paragraph demands comment, and it\u0026rsquo;s the final one where Anderson laments ad clutter on television. In the US, apparently, \u0026ldquo;following deregulation in the mid-1980s, network TV ad time per hour increased from six minutes and forty-eight seconds in 1982 to twelve minutes and four seconds in 2001\u0026rdquo; [165] Why? Because viewers had nowhere to go.\nThe implicit claim is that audiences are now \u0026ldquo;starting to take back their attention\u0026rdquo; [166] and refusing to put up with this advertising overload. And yet it seems clear that the main way of making money from online activity has become, thanks to Google, the insertion of pervasive advertising content alongside and interspersed with content that we are actually interested in. To suggest that we are moving away from an advertising-driven culture is possible only with the blinkered view of cultural industries that characterise the whole book. But that\u0026rsquo;s part of his irrepressible ability to see the online world through rose-tinted glasses, a trait continued in the final section, which is\u0026hellip;\nThe Dangers of Hitism [166-167] Here Anderson celebrates those \u0026ldquo;Kids who started using the Internet as twelve-year-olds in 1995 [and who] turned eighteen (the beginning of Nielsen\u0026rsquo;s 18-34 demographic that is highly coveted by advertisers). The males of the species, in particular, were watching less television. Given a choice between the infinite variety and easy ad-dodging online versus network TV, they were choosing the former\u0026hellip; The audience is migrating away from broadcast to the Internet, where niche economics rule\u0026rdquo; [166].\nIt takes only a few moments of reflection to realise that the \u0026ldquo;infinite variety\u0026rdquo; of the online world was not the only place they were going. They were also spending many hours in the hit-driven world of video games, where endless variations on the theme of war games are aimed at precisely this 18-34 male audience. But Anderson is blind to all manifestations of hit driven culture that don\u0026rsquo;t fit his thesis.\nIt takes only a few more moments to realise that an environment funded by advertising in which ads are easily avoided will not last for long. Something has to change - either companies whose commercial model is based on advertising will fail or advertising will become more intrusive so we can\u0026rsquo;t avoid it.\nThe chapter as a whole does not, I would say, advance the Long Tail thesis. Instead, by returning to some of the topics from earlier in the book, it inadvertently opens our eyes to the complexities and subtleties of what it takes to make a world of variety. The Long Tail model of internet commerce is not up to the task of building such a world.\n","date":1174146654,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0a63a1147e78962880e9b5541b031ac3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_9_2/","publishdate":"2007-03-17T15:50:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_9_2/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses the second half of Chapter 9 - The Short Head.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nBefore I start, a tip of the hat to Aaron Swartz for his kind review of No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart - even if he does think my politics are odd - and for pointing to this series of posts on Chris Anderson\u0026rsquo;s The Long Tail. And welcome to all those readers who have followed the link. Hope you can stick around - I\u0026rsquo;m going to be posting two or three things a week until I get to the end of the book, which will probably take a week or two.\nThe first half of this chapter compares shelves with online stores in a little more detail than earlier chapters, looking at \u0026ldquo;the virtues of shelves and their costs\u0026rdquo; [147] as well as the benefits of \u0026ldquo;the Internet, where niche economics rule\u0026rdquo; [166]. The second half (coming later this week) looks at how you find things. Let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\nThe introductory section puts forward an idea that hits and niches can be complementary. The Long Tail is not against hits. Hits, it says, will always play an important role: they \u0026ldquo;serve as a source of common culture around which more narrowly targeted markets can form\u0026rdquo; [148]. Anderson goes on: \u0026ldquo;Successful Long Tail aggregators need to have both hits and niches. They need to span the full range of variety, from the broadest appeal to the narrowest, to be able to make the connections that can illuminate a path down the Long Tail that makes sense for everyone\u0026rdquo; [148].\n\u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo; here has two separate meanings, not well distinguished. One is cultural - the claim that we are moving from \u0026ldquo;mass markets into millions of niches\u0026rdquo; [12]. The second is a more narrow business meaning - that you can build a successful online business if you do what Amazon has done so well. The book rarely mentions when it is moving back and forth between these meanings, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that they are not the same thing at all. We might get successful Long Tail businesses but not a Long Tail culture if online aggregators drive sources of variety out of business.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s stick with the narrow business meaning for now. Pages 148-149 document the failure of one of the early online music ventures, MP3.com, because it had only niche music. \u0026ldquo;The reason MP3.com\u0026rsquo;s model didn\u0026rsquo;t succeed and the iTunes model \u0026ndash; which is less oriented towards independent musicians - did is that iTunes began by making deals with major record labels, which gave it a critical mass of mainstream music. Then it added more and more niche content, as \u0026ldquo;rights aggregators\u0026rdquo; [not sure what that means - TS] shipped it hard drives full of hundreds of thousands of independent musicians [presumably their songs, not the musicians themselves - TS]. Thus, iTunes customers were able to dive into an already working market where the categories were defined by known commercial acts, which served as a natural leaping off point for the discover of niche music\u0026rdquo;. [149]\nThere is an assumption by this stage in the book that iTunes is a \u0026ldquo;Long Tail aggregator\u0026rdquo;. But is it? iTunes is mentioned on 30 separate occasions in the book, but the only actual figures about their sales are the following:\n \u0026ldquo;Apple said that every one of the then 1 million tracks in iTunes had sold at least once\u0026rdquo; [8]\n \u0026ldquo;As of early 2006, Apple had sold 42 million iPods and 1 billion tracks on iTunes\u0026rdquo; [175]\n  And that\u0026rsquo;s it. This deserves to be emphasized. The book never demonstrates that iTunes is a \u0026ldquo;Long Tail aggregator\u0026rdquo;, so its repeated references to iTunes\u0026rsquo; ability to (for example) \u0026ldquo;democratize distribution\u0026rdquo;[57 - table] and drive demand down the Long Tail are nowhere backed up.\niTunes has a lot of stuff, but does it sell it?\nWith Apple\u0026rsquo;s own figures being \u0026ndash; like so many others on which the thesis of the book relies \u0026ndash; secret, I can only stand on the outside and listen to those who claim to know. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I could find.\nWe already saw in the notes to Chapter 7 that, according to the Wall Street Journal, iTunes is a hits-driven business: \u0026ldquo;Every day, the roughly one million people who visit the iTunes Store home page are presented with several dozen albums, TV shows and movie downloads to consider buying \u0026ndash; out of the four million such goods the Apple site offers. This prime promotion is analogous to a CD being displayed at the checkout stands of all 940 Best Buy stores or featured on the front page of Target\u0026rsquo;s ad circular.\u0026rdquo;\nAs I quoted in the notes to the Introduction, Lee Gomes wrote that \u0026ldquo;At Apple\u0026rsquo;s iTunes, one person who has seen the data \u0026ndash; which Apple doesn\u0026rsquo;t disclose \u0026ndash; said sales \u0026ldquo;closely track Billboard. It\u0026rsquo;s a hits business. The data tend to refute \u0026lsquo;The Long Tail.\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; One of the things about infinite shelves is that there\u0026rsquo;s no harm in saying \u0026ldquo;sure, bring in those hard drives with all those songs. Throw them on the shelf.\u0026rdquo; That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they get sold.\nAnother claim, although also circumstantial, that iTunes is just as hit driven as physical stores was reported in the Guardian in August 2006:\nAt a recent debate hosted by digital music consultancy firm MusicAlly, eMusic's chief executive David Pakman came up with a startling claim. He said that 10% of product on iTunes accounts for 90% of the store's total sales. Rather than smashing the 80/20 rule, the world's most popular download store appeared to be exacerbating it.    He goes on to say:\n\"For the most part, stores that are stocked with music from the majors tend to focus on mainstream music,\" he says. \"It doesn't mean they don't carry a more diverse selection, but when you have Beyonce and the Pussycat Dolls you put them on the home page, and you market and promote that and use it on your advertising. By definition, that tends to attract youth and mainstream music buyers. They come to your site looking for the hits.\"    As a competitor who focuses on niche music, Pakman has a vested interest in pointing fingers at Apple. This should make us treat his statement with caution, but it also reminds us that we should be suspicious of the vested interests on the other side - those CEO\u0026rsquo;s who blurb Anderson\u0026rsquo;s books and who are looking to promote their businesses as revolutionary and shiny new. It is interesting to note that Pakman and his eMusic does believe in the Long Tail, but with a different slant from the one Anderson is giving it in these pages:\nConsequently, 70% of eMusic's catalogue sells more than once every quarter. It sells 5m tracks a month, from a subscriber base of only 200,000 users. \"Our observation is that the Long Tail does exist,\" says Pakman, \"but it doesn't happen naturally. You have to focus on selling it, almost at the expense of promoting the popular stuff.\"    iTunes\u0026rsquo; hits might be \u0026ldquo;a natural leaping off point for the discover of niche music\u0026rdquo;, but there is little evidence that people are making the jump.\nThe Urban Tail [149-151] is one of those odd sections Anderson puts in from time to time where he wanders off to almost unrelated topics, seeing power laws everywhere. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much to do with the remainder of the book. Here it\u0026rsquo;s cities. \u0026ldquo;Another sort of \u0026lsquo;hit\u0026rsquo; is major cities\u0026rdquo; [149] he says, pointing out that the distribution of city populations follows a power law distribution over many orders of magnitude. This is well known, of course. \u0026ldquo;In a sense, you can think of cities as the Long Tail of urban space in the same way the Internet is the Long Tail of idea space or cultural space\u0026rdquo; [150]. Hmmm. Not sure I know what that sentence means, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add to the basic thesis of the book, so I\u0026rsquo;ll move on.\nIn Defense of Shelves [151-152] has a clear purpose. \u0026ldquo;Before we bury the shelf, let us first praise it\u0026rdquo; [151]. It provides some lovely little facts about just how detailed our knowledge of shelf space and how it works is. A nice couple of pages.\nRent by the Half Inch [152-154] starts the attempt to bury the shelf. And shelves do have their problems. Despite everything it\u0026rsquo;s pretty expensive to stock things on shelves, and you can only put an item in one place - a contrast to the digital world, where you can find this very page you are reading by searching for any number of the distinctive and elegant turns of phrase that grace its pixels. This section is a lead-in to the substance of the argument, so there\u0026rsquo;s not much more to say except to point out that Anderson here does his usual trick of comparing the digital world to only the most hit-driven part of the physical world and presenting the comparison as if it was a complete comparison of physical and digital worlds: \u0026ldquo;Today, the average cost of carrying a single DVD in a movie rental store is $22 a year. Only the most popular titles rent often enough to make that back (there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why they call it \u0026lsquo;Blockbuster\u0026rsquo;).\u0026rdquo; It is likely, of course, that any independent video store (hello Generation X) will have cheaper rent than a Blockbuster and so is more likely to stock minority interest content.\nThe Wal-Mart Effect [154-156], named after the excellent Charles Fishman book, continues this slanted comparison by focusing on the company with more shelves than anyone else in the world, and looking at its CD aisle. Wal-Mart stocks about 4,500 unique CD titles, as was noted in Chapter 1, compared to 800,000 for Amazon [155]. As Anderson points out, \u0026ldquo;Wal-Mart, which accounts for about one-fifth of all music sales in America, is by far the nation\u0026rsquo;s largest music retailer\u0026rdquo; [155]. \u0026ldquo;Today, the number of large independent music stores like the one I worked at has dropped dramatically, the classical music listening room is now an endangered species. There are, needless to say, few import aisles left\u0026rdquo; [155].\nThere is no doubt that Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s efforts have directly cut into the diversity of music available on those physical shelves. A 2004 article in Rolling Stone by Warren Cohen charts Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s growth and impact: \u0026ldquo;Unlike a typical Tower store, which stocks 60,000 titles, an average Wal-Mart carries about 5,000 CDs\u0026rdquo;. (Tower has apparently gone bust since then - I\u0026rsquo;m writing from outside the US, so American readers please excuse my unfamiliarity with Tower). Even some well known albums are missing, Cohen points out in the same article: \u0026ldquo;At a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Thorton, Colorado, for example, there were no copies of the Rolling Stones\u0026rsquo; Exile on Main Street or Nirvana\u0026rsquo;s Nevermind.\u0026rdquo; Anderson makes a similar point, describing a walk he took around a Wal-Mart in Oakland, where \u0026ldquo;There are no copies of the Rolling Stones\u0026rsquo; Exile on Main Street or Nirvana\u0026rsquo;s Nevermind\u0026rdquo;. Oops! I guess Mr. Anderson has been reading Rolling Stone. Should have given Mr. Cohen some credit there.\nBut enough with the scurrilous suggestions - I do have a serious point to make about this section and it\u0026rsquo;s about that old Wal-Mart/digital comparison. Way back in Chapter 1 Anderson compared Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s 4500 CDs (60,000 tracks, he estimated) to Rhapsody, where \u0026ldquo;Not only is every one of Rhapsody\u0026rsquo;s top 60,000 tracks streamed at least once each month, but the same is true for its top 100,000, top 200,000, and top 400,000 \u0026ndash; even its top 600,000, top 900,000, and beyond\u0026rdquo; [22]. The listing of increasing hundreds of thousands of tracks is clearly intended to contrast the paucity of choices available on Main Street with the digital Nirvana. It\u0026rsquo;s an intent made even clearer in his diagram on page 23 where he categorizes stuff you can\u0026rsquo;t buy at Wal-Mart as \u0026ldquo;Products you can\u0026rsquo;t find anywhere but online\u0026rdquo;. But this description is false. The Rolling Stone article suggests that a specialist music store would stock 60,000 titles which, at the same tracks per CD ratio used by Anderson, is 800,000 tracks. Rhapsody\u0026rsquo;s selling is not, perhaps, so niche driven or abundant as we would think.\nThe big point about The Long Tail is a cultural one, and the moral of the story according to Anderson is that we are moving away from a world of hits to a world of niche interests. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the story this comparison tells. Instead, the story is of a retail model with a fair amount of effective diversity (the specialist record store) being squeezed in a technology-driven vice. One jaw of the vice is the technology-driven Wal-Mart, which uses its IT expertise and economies of scale along with other strategies to take the hits away from the specialists, driving them out of business. The other jaw is the online stores, which also benefit from economies of scale and are left to mop up any demand for diversity that is left, because it is no longer attainable in the physical world.\nFrom what we can tell, iTunes is doing a poor job of selling niche products and, as the Guardian quotes Greg Eden, general manager of the trade organisation for the UK\u0026rsquo;s independent music sector:\nunlike the high street, online distribution means one supplier can dominate the mass market. \"What you see on the internet is very much the 'Highlander Theory',\" says Eden. \"'There can be only one'. There's only one search engine, there's only one big book retailer, one big online auction house, and so on. .    The driving force of technology is not having effect Anderson would like it to have. There may be ways of generating more demand for out-of-the-mainstream tastes and a challenging, diverse culture, but Wal-Mart + iTunes isn\u0026rsquo;t it.\nNext time, the second half of Chapter 9, which turns the topic to finding things on shelves.\n","date":1173919776,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"c1455213b24369856342bffe2125709f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_long_tail_9/","publishdate":"2007-03-15T00:49:36Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_long_tail_9/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses the first half of Chapter 9 - The Short Head.

You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nI meant to write about page 141, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nWhat happens on page 141 of The Long Tail is that Chris Anderson acknowledges, for the first and only time in the book, how some word of mouth effects can run counter to the long tail forces he talks about. Dipper asked the question, back in comments on Chapter 1, \u0026ldquo;One reason people buy arts and cultural products such as books, dvd\u0026rsquo;s, games, clothes, cars is to participate in cultural life. that means buying what other people are buying\u0026rdquo;. Anderson phrases the question here, in a section on music and how the one-big-powerlaw is composed of many little powerlaws:\nThe characteristic steep falloff shape of a popularity powerlaw comes from the effect of powerful word-of-mouth feedback loops that amplify consumer preference, making the reputation-rich even richer and the reputation-poor relatively poorer. Success breeds success. In network theory such positive feedback loops tend to create winner-take-all phenomena, which is another way of saying that they're awesome hit-making machines. Compounding matters, today's filters make word-of-mouth even more powerful by measuring so much more of it from so many more people and for so many more products. Shouldn't that then have the effect of making the powerlaw even steeper, increasing the gap between hits and niches rather than having a leveling effect?    I did wonder what Anderson was going to address this obvious counter-argument somewhere in his book, and this is the place he does so. It\u0026rsquo;s a very plausible argument - and one that I personally believe has some merit, especially given the shaky empirical support the book musters for an actual Long Tail shift. He addresses it in half a page. He argues that\n\"filters and other recommendation systems actually work most strongly at the niche level, within a genre and subgenre. But between genres their effect is more muted... Thus the most popular \"ambient dub\" artist at the very head of the ambient dub popularity curve can hugely outsell the others in that category, but that doesn't mean the artist will snowball and tear up the charts to knock 50 Cent out of the top ten. The lesson from this microstructure analysis is that popularity exists at multiple scales, and ruling a clique doesn't necessarily make you the homecoming queen.\"    And that\u0026rsquo;s it. There is no back-up in the end notes, not cases, no references to more detailed theoretical work, nothing. It is a tiny sketch of the beginnings of an argument, but it\u0026rsquo;s nothing more than that. Here are some obvious questions that come to my mind:\n If the effects of filters are muted between genres, why did you tell us about the great success of Touching the Void at the beginning of the book? Is that somehow different? Is there not a mountaineering genre in the book market? How does that fit with your argument here?\n If the effects of filters are muted between genres, where does that leave the mechanism for \u0026ldquo;pushing demand down the long tail\u0026rdquo;? Haven\u0026rsquo;t you just argued against the mechanism you promoted in the previous chapter?\n Do you have any data from any industry to back up these speculations?\n  There is no answer to any of these questions in this book. It reads as if Anderson has found a plausibility argument strong enough for himself, and has then dismissed the question and moved on. Too bad - I thought we were going to get some real argument here.\n","date":1173728151,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4c47f7e32d2b906ad7929b217d446365","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/a_note_on_netwo/","publishdate":"2007-03-12T19:35:51Z","relpermalink":"/post/a_note_on_netwo/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses a piece of Chapter 8 - Long Tail Economics that I missed yesterday.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nBy this time in the book we\u0026rsquo;ve seen variants on the long tail graph a lot of times.\nThe chapter is a collection of observations about this shape. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a whole lot to say about this chapter, so this is a short post.\nThe chapter starts by talking about the Pareto 80\u0026frasl;20 rule (that 20% of the people in populations Pareto studied owned 80% of the wealth) and Zipf\u0026rsquo;s Law (that the frequencies of use of words in the language follow a similar kind of fall-off). These and others are examples of power law distributions that crop up in a bunch of different places. Power laws are called long-tailed curves because \u0026ldquo;the amplitude \u0026hellip; approaches but never reaches zero as the curve stretches out to infinity\u0026rdquo; [126]. This is true of many kinds of distributions, of course, including exponential and log-normal distributions. But even within the family of power-law curves, of the form\ny = ax-k\nThe area under the long tail depends on the value of the exponent k. A power law distribution itself is not enough to ensure a significant long tail. It\u0026rsquo;s only if the exponent is a small number (close to 1) that the \u0026ldquo;tail\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;fat\u0026rdquo; as John says - has a significant area under the curve.\nHow Distribution Bottlenecks Distort Markets [127-130]. If you plot a power law on a log-log scale you get a straight line with slope -k. Anderson looks at some markets (movies on movie screens) and notices that they fall off below the line at a small value. He interprets this as a failure of markets to meet demand because of the cost structure of movie theatres. If there\u0026rsquo;s not enough demand to fill a theatre, films won\u0026rsquo;t get distribution. There\u0026rsquo;s some truth to this - there are costs to producing and distributing movies that demand a return on investment, and movies that don\u0026rsquo;t make the cut will not be distributed at all. In non-theatrical channels, where cost is less, more movies are available and watched. As the title of the section suggests, Anderson sees only the untruncated power law as somehow \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; [127] and a reflection of consumer demand, and the truncated ones a measure of artificial scarcity caused by distribution bottlenecks, to be removed in the world of abundance. Yet even in the online world there are truncated distributions, they just occur at different places in the distribution chain. The small number of search engines or online auction houses are two examples. The idea that consumer demand is \u0026ldquo;naturally\u0026rdquo; a power law shape is unsubstantiated, at least in the pages of the book.\nThe strangeness of the comparison between theatres and rentals is exemplified by this sentence: \u0026ldquo;demand keeps on going into niches that were never even considered before \u0026ndash; instructional videos, karaoke, Turkish TV, you name it\u0026rdquo; [130]. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what he means by \u0026ldquo;never even considered before\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;m sure the reason instructional videos were not made available on movie theatre screens was not so much \u0026ldquo;an artifact of the traditional costs of offering them\u0026rdquo; but the fact that the number of people who want to watch instructional videos _in movie theatres _is probably vanishingly small no matter how large a geography you spread them over. It\u0026rsquo;s like comparing the market for banquets to the market for snacks - they\u0026rsquo;re both food, but the demand pattern is different for one than for the other, and the limited demand for banquets is not \u0026ldquo;unnatural\u0026rdquo;.\nThis section is one of those that come occasionally in the book, containing a scattered set of only loosely related data points, with sentences like \u0026ldquo;In books, Barnes and Noble found that the bottom 1.2 million titles represent just 1.7 percent of its in-store sales, but a full 10 percent of its online (bn.com) sales. PRX, which licenses a huge library of public radio programming online, reports that the bottom 80 percent of its content now accounts for half of its sales.\u0026rdquo;[130] The \u0026ldquo;statistics\u0026rdquo; come from \u0026ldquo;direct personal correspondence with their executives\u0026rdquo;. Is this trustworthy data or is it picked to illustrate a pre-conceived idea? What does PRX do and what is the nature of its business? Who knows - that sentence is the sole reference to them in the book. How does the Barnes and Noble statement fit with Lee Gomes\u0026rsquo; claim in the Wall Street Journal that \u0026ldquo;The head of a major New York publishing operation says that the distribution of his titles is essentially the same in both online and \u0026ldquo;bricks and mortar\u0026rdquo; channels.\u0026rdquo; These isolated, context-free sentences from executives seem to be the best we can do \u0026ndash; actual company data being tightly-held secrets.\nI have little to say about the remainder of the chapter, The 80\u0026frasl;20 Rule [130-135] is a meandering take on whether or not the Rule still applies. The other sections are Does a Longer Tail Mean a Shorter Head? [135-137], Does The Long Tail Increase Demand or Just Shift It? [137-138], Should Prices Rise or Fall Down the Long Tail? [133-139], \u0026ldquo;Microstructure\u0026rdquo; in the Long Tail? [139-142], The Long Tail of Time [142-143], and The Tragically Neglected Economics of Abundance [143-146]. As the titles suggest, this is a miscellany of observations about the shape of the graph. There\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot to disagree with, but there\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot of substance.\nI could stop here\u0026hellip; or I could just throw in a few things that irritate me, just to be grouchy. So don\u0026rsquo;t take this too seriously, but:\nIn the section on \u0026ldquo;Microstructure\u0026rdquo; [140] Anderson shows a graph of the average sales for various of the many subgenres that Rhapsody divides music into and claims that this selection shows \u0026ldquo;a Long Tail\u0026rdquo;. Yet it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. The graph does fall off left to right, as it cannot help but do, but it is as close to a linear fall-off as a power law.\n\u0026ldquo;One of the features of powerlaws is that they are \u0026lsquo;fractal\u0026rsquo;, which is to say that no matter how far you zoom in they still look like powerlaws\u0026rdquo; [138] Wrong. Straight lines still look like straight lines as you zoom in too, but that\u0026rsquo;s not enough to make a fractal. A fractal reveals new structure as you zoom in, and that structure is similar to the structure seen from further away.\n\u0026ldquo;Einstein described time as the fourth dimension of space, you can think of it equally as the fourth dimension of the Long Tail\u0026rdquo; [142]. Wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s not the \u0026ldquo;fourth dimension of space\u0026rdquo;, and the way he plots it is actually a third dimension of the Long Tail graph. Plus, it\u0026rsquo;s name dropping. This section, by the way, is devoted to the realization that \u0026ldquo;If you think about it, today\u0026rsquo;s hit is tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s niche\u0026rdquo;, which is hardly shocking, but \u0026ldquo;Both hits and niches see their sales slow over time; hits may start higher, but they all end up down the Tail eventually. The research to quantify this conclusion is continuing\u0026rdquo; [142] Count me underwhelmed.\nOn abundance: \u0026ldquo;Abundance, like growth itself, is a force that is changing our world in ways that we experience every day, whether we have an equation to describe it or not\u0026rdquo; [146]. This is stuff that should have been thrown out during editing.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all. More tomorrow, I hope.\n","date":1173650490,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"20abeeafd8d44809e4f6d0fbd5129c53","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/this_is_another/","publishdate":"2007-03-11T22:01:30Z","relpermalink":"/post/this_is_another/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 8 - Long Tail Economics.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here.\nIn a comment on Chapter 6, John points us to an article which mentions Ranganathan\u0026rsquo;s Five Laws of Library Science.These laws are:\n Books are for use.\n Every person his or her book.\n Every book its reader.\n Save the time of the reader.\n The library is a growing organism.\n  Laws 2 and 3 remind us that the whole publishing process is about guidance. Guiding readers to books they like, and guiding books to readers who like them. The various stages of writing, submitting to publishers, editing, publishing, publicising, reviewing, discovering, recommending, locating, browsing, requesting, buying/borrowing, delivering are one path through the maze that is needed to guide books to their readers and readers to their books. Guidance is the subject of Chapter 7.\nI want to leap ahead some pages into the chapter this time. Because on at last, after a hundred and nine pages, we get some real evidence of a specific industry that is showing a big Long Tail effect - and it\u0026rsquo;s our old friend Netflix.\nFilters rule [108-110] is a reflection of Anderson\u0026rsquo;s belief in the power of filters to \u0026ldquo;level the playing field, offering free marketing for films that can\u0026rsquo;t otherwise afford it, and this spreading demand more evenly between hits and niches\u0026rdquo; [110]. The main effect, he says, is \u0026ldquo;to help people move from the world they know (\u0026lsquo;hits\u0026rsquo;) to the world they don\u0026rsquo;t (\u0026lsquo;niches\u0026rsquo;)\u0026rdquo; [109].\nThe evidence that he gives in this section in favour of the claim comes Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix (and provider of a blurb for the book):\nHistorically BlockBuster has reported that about 90% of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases. Online they're more niche: about 70% of what they rent from their website is new releases and about 30% is back catalog. That's not true for Netflix. About 30% of what we rent is new releases and about 70% is back catalog and it's not because we have a different subscriber. It's because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that you'll really like. And we do it algorithmically, with recommendations and ratings.    In fact, since the book was published, Netflix have set up the Netflix Prize for people to suggest better algorithms. The first submission to improve the accuracy of the algorithm by 10% will win $1 million. So Netflix are taking this seriously. Finally, there appears to be some substance behind the shifting generalities of the book.\nOr is there? Lee Gomes of the Wall Street Journal begs to differ.\nNetflix defines \"back catalog\" expansively. A spokesman says it's anything outside of the 50 or so DVDs getting heavy studio promotion at any given time. So even recent megahits like \"Spiderman II\" are in the back catalog.     What's more, since Netflix rents 60,000 titles, it follows that those 50 titles -- eight-tenths of 1% of inventory -- generate 30% of all rentals.    This was the second of two Gomes articles on the Long Tail and part of a debate that focused on the extent of the effect that Anderson is describing. The first article was a review of the book, and in that review he referred to work by Harvard Business School\u0026rsquo;s Anita Elberse that only \u0026ldquo;shows a \u0026lsquo;slight shift\u0026rsquo; toward the tail. But she also noted \u0026lsquo;a rapidly increasing number of titles that never, or very rarely, sell,\u0026rsquo; which suggests \u0026lsquo;it is difficult for content providers to profit from the \u0026lsquo;tail.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;. Again, a \u0026ldquo;slight shift\u0026rdquo; is not an \u0026ldquo;epochal shift\u0026rdquo;. Anderson responded to that review, arguing that\nAs Professor Elberse told Gomes, she was only describing Nielsen VideoScan data, which is almost entirely taken from bricks-and-mortar sources. The Netflix data, which was the basis of the Long Tail analysis that she and I worked on together, tells a very different story (Elberse's terms of data access don't allow her to share that data; my terms allowed me to share what I published in the book). We both urged Gomes to make clear that the \"slight shift\" measured didn't refer to the Netflix data that was at the core of the book's conclusions. But he chose to make the point he wanted to make.    In comments to that post, Elberse herself stepped in to say that\nYou [Anderson] say \"Nielsen VideoScan data (...) is almost entirely taken from bricks-and-mortar sources.\" I don't think this is entirely correct. The VideoScan data reflect both offline and online sales, and actually break them down by channel. The breakdown is not as detailed as one might wish in an ideal world, but they do allow one to track whether, say, the share of offline sales go down over time. Therefore, I do think the fact that my colleague and I only observe a \"slight\" shift is meaningful.    In a letter published on Nicholas Carr\u0026rsquo;s weblog, Gomes said.\nI'd like to correct an extremely serious misrepresentation Chris made at the end of his blog posting, to the effect that Anita Elberse of Harvard \"urged\" me not to characterize her work the way I did. This is manifestly false. Chris is either misremembering or deliberately conflating two separate issues. Prof. Elberse did indeed in an email remind me that the data she had for Netflix was under NDA, and I could thus not report it. But the comment had nothing to do with what Chris says it does. Let Prof. Elberse herself describe whether I got it right; below is the full text of an email she sent me after the story ran:     \"I just read your article, and just wanted to thank you for being so careful in quoting me. I wish all journalists stayed this close to what was actually said! :-)     \"You did beat me 'to the market' with your article, but I hope our academic article (which should be ready in a few weeks) will further clarify the long tail phenomenon (or lack thereof).\"    A lot of heat there. For anyone interested in more depth, I recommend you to Anita Elberse and Felix Oberholzer-Gee\u0026rsquo;s working paper \u0026ldquo;Superstars and Underdogs: An Examination of the Long Tail Phenomenon in Video Sales\u0026rdquo; (50 page PDF). Here is a paragraph from the abstract:\nTo shed light on this debate, we study the distribution of revenues across products in the context of the U.S. home video industry for the 2000 to 2005 period. We find superstar and long-tail effects in home video sales, but each effect comes with a twist. There is a long-tail effect in that the number of titles that sell only a few copies every week increases almost twofold during our study period. But at the same time, the number of non-selling titles rises rapidly; it is now four times as high as in 2000. Many underdogs thus in fact appear to be losers. We also find evidence of a superstar effect. Among the best-performing titles, an ever-smaller number of titles accounts for the bulk of sales. The caveat here is that today’s superstars lack the punch of earlier generations: video sales generally decrease over time across all quantiles of the sales distribution, but this effect is most pronounced among best-selling titles. Our findings have important implications for entertainment companies. Exploiting the tail might prove unprofitable if many titles do not sell at all. At the same time, producing superstars is more difficult than ever. The trends we uncover thus point to significant challenges for the entertainment industry.    In short, this most significant, most specific piece of information regarding an actual shift to long-tail behaviour, prompted and guided by Internet recommendation algorithms, turns out to be as insubstantial as other pieces of evidence. Filters don\u0026rsquo;t rule.\nWell, with that over, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the beginning. There is, we all know, a lot of stuff on the Internet, which is why the picture is so appealing. But as John pointed out in his Chapter 6 comment (and as I\u0026rsquo;ll say in more detail in Chapter 8), the tail has to be fat as well as long for the \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; to make any sense. We also know that increasing returns and large fixed costs coupled with small marginal costs and freedom from geographical limitations gives the aggregators of the Internet (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes and the other handful of examples that Anderson returns to over and over again) the potential to be globe-straddling colossi, or oligonomies, to use Steve Hannaford\u0026rsquo;s word, who are oligopolies as far as customers go and oligopsonies as far as suppliers go. So the Internet is likely to have fewer vendors selling larger numbers of products than the brick \u0026amp; mortar world - One Big Virtual Tent rather than Many Small Tents. But where does this leave us when it comes to demand? It all depends on whether guidance on the Internet can help people find niche products in the Big Tent better than guidance in the physical world can help people find what they want in the Many Small Tents. The issue of guidance, then, is central.\nNot only is it central, but it\u0026rsquo;s a particularly difficult problem for niche items. The problem of finding quality in \u0026ldquo;experience goods\u0026rdquo; - such as books, movies, and to some extent music - is a problem of asymmetric information. As such, it is prone to a form of market failure that goes under the name of the market for lemons. In short, the incentives are set up to encourage various forms of false reporting and gaming of the system (I have a strong incentive to give my own book a five-star rating on Amazon, for example). Knowing this, customers avoid those parts of the market where the asymmetry in information is strongest - the niches - and flee to those parts where information is most reliable - the hits. Predictability can drive out quality when information is scarce and unreliable. The market for lemons has been one of the most influential ideas in economics over the last several decades, its ramifications are ubiquitous, and it earned its inventor George Akerlof a Nobel Prize. But even though Anderson describes his book as \u0026ldquo;partly an economic research project\u0026rdquo; [11] there is no evidence this idea has troubled him, and it is not mentioned in his book.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at how Anderson says guidance happens in the Long Tail world. Here\u0026rsquo;s the big picture, optimistic as ever:\nFaith in advertising and the institutions that pay for it is waning, while faith in individuals is on the rise. Peers trust peers. Top-down messaging is losing traction, while bottom-up buzz is gaining power. Dell spends hundreds of millions each year on promoting its quality and customer service, but if you Google \"dell hell\" you'll get 55,000 pages of results [click [here](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2007/03/progressive_blo.html) to see why this number is wildly wrong]. Even the word \"dell\" returns customer complaints by the second page of results. The same inversion of power is now changing the marketing game for everything from individual products to people. The collective now controls the message....The new tastemakers are us... The ants have megaphones. [98-99]    But as Oligopoly Watch reminded us just yesterday, \u0026ldquo;while the myth is that the Internet represents an infinite array of shelves (I think of Borges\u0026rsquo;s library of Babel) with everything democratically and randomly available, the real world has a way of organizing things up front or way back, even when it\u0026rsquo;s all cyberspace.\u0026rdquo; Aggregators are One Big Virtual Tent, and vendors will scrabble to get a place on the tables by the entrance. Oligopoly Watch quotes a Wall Street Journal article on Apple\u0026rsquo;s iTunes (\u0026lsquo;Music\u0026rsquo;s New Gatekeeper\u0026rsquo;) as saying \u0026ldquo;Every day, the roughly one million people who visit the iTunes Store home page are presented with several dozen albums, TV shows and movie downloads to consider buying \u0026ndash; out of the four million such goods the Apple site offers. This prime promotion is analogous to a CD being displayed at the checkout stands of all 940 Best Buy stores or featured on the front page of Target\u0026rsquo;s ad circular.\u0026rdquo; Here is a way that Internet commerce, with its tendency to produce oligopolies, promotes uniformity rather than promoting diversity. Instead of many different store fronts, we have One Big Virtual Storefront. A high proportion of regular bookstores\u0026rsquo; sales come from the highly-promoted items, and there is no reason to believe that aggregators\u0026rsquo; sales will be different.\nBonnie McKee [98-103], My Chemical Romance [103-104] and BirdMonster [104-106] are three stories about different bands and their mixed experiences with online recommendation systems, social networking sites, and blogs to promote their music. While Anderson says that the stories show \u0026ldquo;how the three forces of the Long Tail are overturning the status quo in the music industry\u0026rdquo; [104]. A big statement, with little behind it. My Chemical Romance is a success, Bonnie McKee is struggling, and BirdMonster is a local band in San Fransisco. This is new? No.\nThe Power of Collective Intelligence [106-108] introduces us to the filter, which is \u0026ldquo;the catch-all phrase for recommendations and other tools that help you find quality in the Long Tail\u0026rdquo; [106]. Anderson is very enthusiastic about recommendation systems, saying that \u0026ldquo;the trend-watchers at Frog Design\u0026rdquo; see the rise of recommendations as \u0026ldquo;nothing less than an epochal shift\u0026rdquo; [107].\nThe adoption of recommendation systems on all kinds of web sites has been a boon to help promote worthwhile content and demote non-worthwhile content, and as they get more sophisticated they are a continuing innovation of great worth. But they set out to rectify a problem that is peculiar to the Internet, after all, which is the problem of anonymity and lack of trust. How do you establish trust in the online world? The existence of recommendations is a reflection of the fact that the Internet is handicapped when it comes to reliable and trustworthy communication. Recommendation systems are a great effort to overcome an obstacle that the physical world (which has its own problems) faces to a much smaller degree. When a friend recommends a book or movie to me, I have a reasonable idea of how to take that recommendation because I know my friend. When a book has a 3.5 rating on Amazon.com with three reviews, what am I to make of that? Was it friends of the author? Quite possibly.\nThe next section, \u0026ldquo;Filters Rule\u0026rdquo; was discussed at the top of the article.\nOne Size Filter Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Fit All [110-112] looks at various kinds of filter in more depth. It shows that filters are an increasingly sophisticated set of tools for aggregators to use to attract customers. But it does not show whether or not these filters are anything close to the power of our own offline networks of friends.\nNot All Top Ten Lists are Created Equal [112-115] is more in a similar vein. Some online sites have developed filters that use an increasingly fine granularity and set of classifications of online lists. But can any algorithmic granularity capture our quirky tastes?\nIs the Long Tail Full of Crap? [115-119] is a venture into explanation. It contains references to information theory, to zero sum games, to non-rivalrous goods, and to wide dynamic ranges. But they are name dropping, inserted to hint at a greater intellectual behind the Long Tail. It isn\u0026rsquo;t there. The point he is making is that, as Theodore Sturgeon [I always thought he was a creation of Kurt Vonnegut, but Wikipedia tells me that Vonnegut\u0026rsquo;s Kilgore Trout was based on the real-life Theodore Sturgeon] apparently said \u0026ldquo;ninety percent of everything is crud\u0026rdquo;. But as long as you have unlimited shelf space, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, because filters can help you find the good. There is an odd unsubstantiated claim that the material \u0026ldquo;in the tail\u0026rdquo; ranges from worse than that in the hits to better but, he goes on, \u0026ldquo;averages don\u0026rsquo;t matter. Diamonds can be found anywhere.\u0026rdquo;[118].\nThe Tail That Wags Everything Else [119-122] is another slight section which reiterates the previous point: \u0026ldquo;As the Tail gets longer, the signal-to-noise ratio gets worse. Thus, the only way a consumer can maintain a consistently good enough signal to find what he or she wants is if the filters get increasingly powerful\u0026rdquo; [119]. It is out here in the tail, where comments on Amazon, links, and other filters are rare per item, that problems of asymmetric information are greatest, raising a further undiscussed barrier to those good quality items in the tail achieving recognition. So filters have a greater job to do, and are fighting an uphill battle. How do they do? Well I could use the Anderson method and point out that typing \u0026ldquo;ebay fraud\u0026rdquo; into Google gives [about] 4,160,000 hits - but in fact, Google estimates being what they are, the number is actually 780, so that tells us little. But see here, here, and here for articles about manipulating reputation systems - the last two, ironically, from the Anderson-edited Wired Magazine. The first article of the three, by Princeton University Computer Science Professor Ed Felten, says this:\nThere’s a myth floating around that such systems distill an uncannily accurate folk judgment from the votes submitted by millions of ordinary citizens. The wisdom of crowds, and all that. In fact, reputation systems are fraught with problems, and the most important systems survive because companies expend great effort to supplement the algorithms by investigating abuse and trying to compensate for it. eBay, for example, reportedly works very hard to fight abuse of its reputation system.    \u0026ldquo;The wisdom of crowds, and all that\u0026rdquo; just about summarizes Anderson\u0026rsquo;s sunny outlook on this promising but still-flawed, and perhaps unavoidably flawed, method for directing demand.\nI should also point out that Anderson also briefly quotes[120] Nassim Taleb\u0026rsquo;s engaging book Fooled By Randomness, on the unpredictability of hits.\nPre-Filters and Post-Filters [122-124] distinguishes the \u0026ldquo;pre-filters\u0026rdquo; of the offline world which \u0026ldquo;filter before things get to market\u0026rdquo; and the recommendation and search technologies, or \u0026ldquo;post-filters\u0026rdquo; of the Internet. Here, then, are two models of guidance in an attempt to achieve that \u0026ldquo;every book its reader\u0026rdquo; ideal. Given the challenges faced by post-filters (the increasing \u0026ldquo;signal to noise\u0026rdquo; ratio in the tail discussed by Anderson, the potential for gaming the system, the market-for-lemons problem that particularly targets niche products in the face of that potential), it is good to see Anderson does acknowledge the difficulties: \u0026ldquo;Because post-filters tend to be amateurs, oftentimes that means less critical independence and more random malice.\u0026rdquo; But in general he is remarkably sunny about the prospect for Internet recommendations to direct people reliably to even the deepest darkest corners of the One Big Virtual Tent. Filters are great, but they have a big job to do. Overall, I don\u0026rsquo;t share his optimism.\n","date":1173552613,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f9f5d371310e1d4df54c897aa7be39f1","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_new_tastema/","publishdate":"2007-03-10T18:50:13Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_new_tastema/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 7 - The New Tastemakers.

I\u0026rsquo;m doing it because the book is widely read, influential, enthusiastically pro-market, and also sloppy and wrong wrong wrong. If you want to see the beginning of the series, go here. If you want to see them all in descending order, go here.\nI usually try for about three chapters a week, but I only got two done over the last week, so here\u0026rsquo;s a bonus teaser for the next chapter, which is Chapter 7. It\u0026rsquo;s a little thing - one sentence in the middle of the book - but it says something about the author\u0026rsquo;s cavalier attitude to facts.\nChris Anderson says:\nDell spends hundreds of millions each year on promoting its quality and customer service, but if you Google \"dell hell\" you'll get 55,000 pages of results.[99] (I put page numbers in square brackets)    At ten results per page (the default) that\u0026rsquo;s 550,000 results. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can reproduce this number.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s try \u0026ldquo;dell hell\u0026rdquo; in quotes, as he shows it. Over at the right of the page it says \u0026ldquo;results 1-10 of about 69,600\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s 696 pages, not 55,000.\nBut Google\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; numbers are notoriously inaccurate. To get a more precise number, first I recommend changing the preferences to return 100 results per page (less clicking), redo the search, and then click through the pages. How many results do you end up with? A total of 693. That\u0026rsquo;s 70 pages of results, not 55,000.\nSuppose he meant without the quotes. Let\u0026rsquo;s try that. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; number at the top right of the page is now 1,620,000 - or 162,000 pages of regular results. That\u0026rsquo;s about three times the number Anderson quotes - perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s changed in the last two years. So this is where he gets his number from, I guess.\nBut as I said, that \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; number is notoriously unreliable. Click through the pages and how many results do you get? 753. That\u0026rsquo;s 76 pages of results at the default ten-per-page.\nSo Anderson claims 55,000 pages of results because it\u0026rsquo;s a big number, and a big number illustrates the point he is making, but a five minute test shows that he is overestimating by about 54,924.\nSo much for that claim. And unfortunately (in case you were wondering what I think) it\u0026rsquo;s typical of the book.\n","date":1173393667,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"81cf988798d946a5f5b017192ebecf94","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/progressive_blo/","publishdate":"2007-03-08T22:41:07Z","relpermalink":"/post/progressive_blo/","section":"post","summary":"First, welcome to readers from progressivebloggers.ca, where I am now an affiliate (just).\nIf you are coming here for the first time, let me catch you up.

Well that\u0026rsquo;s just too bad, because this blog is nothing but The Long Tail until I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through the whole thing, repetition and tedium be damned. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, come back in about three or four weeks if things go according to plan.\nStill here? Great. Glad to have you. It is time to cast your mind back and recall that Chapter 4 spelled out the Three Forces of the Long Tail and that Chapter 5 was about the first one: Production. Chapter 6, today\u0026rsquo;s subject, is about the second force: distribution. And whereas Chapter 5 was bolted on to the side of the Long Tail hypothesis, Chapter 6 is right in the middle of it. It\u0026rsquo;s about Internet aggregators, in particular Amazon, and how they go about filling their long shelves.\nThe first section of the chapter is one of the more interesting stories in the book. It\u0026rsquo;s about the success, at the third attempt, of Alibris, a company that seeks to \u0026ldquo;deliver the growing power of e-commerce to independent booksellers while delivering extraordinary selection to businesses and book lovers\u0026rdquo; (from the Alibris web site). The used book market (other than university textbooks) is fine if you are a browser hoping to stumble across a quirky find, but problematic for people looking for a particular book because there are \u0026ldquo;not enough sellers and buyers of an unbounded set of commodities\u0026rdquo; [87]. As a result, the odds of finding your book are slim. \u0026ldquo;Thus, most buyers simply never consider a used-book store when they\u0026rsquo;re shopping for something specific\u0026rdquo; [87].\nAlibris takes the inventory of used book stores, gathers them together, and puts this big database online, making it available to Amazon and other online outlets such as bn.com, where used books appear alongside new books when customers search for a book. The result is a fast-growing used-book industry (11% in the US in 2004) [88]. This story shows what the Internet is good at: bringing unconnected people together. It sounds like, and maybe is, a hopeful story, \u0026ldquo;creating a liquid market where there was an illiquid market before\u0026rdquo; [88]. (Aside - it is odd that Anderson talks about the American Alibris and completely neglects its bigger Canadian competitor Abebooks, who now own the fine librarything web site, but perhaps he is subject to the tyranny of geography in the physical world).\nIt is likely that a move to used book buying and selling is a pretty diverse market compared to new books, but it may be of interest to note that the Alibris founder says, in discussing a new Alibris pricing initiative that \u0026ldquo; It\u0026rsquo;s true that the Alibris Pricing Service really is oriented mainly around common books - but that\u0026rsquo;s more than 80% of the demand out there, so it tackles the vast majority of the market\u0026rdquo;. Alibris is a private company and does not make its detailed sales figures available, so it is difficult to know for sure. But used books are one of those areas where the Long Tail hypothesis has the strongest ring of truth.\nEnter the Aggregators [88-89] picks up from the Alibris example and uses it as an example of a \u0026ldquo;Long Tail \u0026lsquo;aggregator\u0026rsquo; - a company or service that collects a huge variety of goods and makes them available and easy to find\u0026rdquo; [88]. And the Alibris story shows that there are ways in which the Internet can pull people together. But while aggregation can be a fine thing, it does have a dark side, and that side is market power. Canny aggregators know this. Alibris, for example, does not put its customers in touch with the used book stores that actually sell the books. Instead, the book store owner sends their book to Alibris, who then sends it on to the customer. In this way, Alibris becomes the hub of the market: the central repository of knowledge, while the individual book stores who it relies on are kept in the dark. This appears to have led to some resentment amongst some librarians and book store owners, although I have no idea how widespread this is.\nWhat this means is that online aggregators become the new powerhouse in the industries they move into. Amazon in the world of new books, Abebooks and Alibris in the world of used books, and so on. Google, of course, is seeking to aggregate everything and so become the hub for \u0026ldquo;the world\u0026rsquo;s information\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is a mixed development for those whose information is being aggregated. Newspapers, for example, are not thrilled at the idea of Google News presenting their information freely to the world, while the newspapers themselves struggle over lost income. With Google making scads of advertising money off presenting information to people, it looks like the balance of power has shifted from the content originators to aggregators.\nAggregators are here to stay. What remains to be seen, however, is if they bring with them any real move towards a more diverse pattern of demand and consumption.\nSo aggregators are the Long Tail enterprises that represent \u0026ldquo;the future of business\u0026rdquo;, and Anderson says \u0026ldquo;there are literally thousands of them\u0026rdquo; [88]. Are we now going to hear about the wave of the future, and see what shape it is taking?\nNo. Frustratingly, the only examples he lists after that teasing sentence are our old friends Google, Rhapsody, iTunes, Netflix and eBay \u0026ndash; the same handful of companies he\u0026rsquo;s been going on about in the first few chapters. He does also mention Bloglines, an RSS feed aggregator, and Wikipedia, which I\u0026rsquo;ve argued is not an \u0026ldquo;aggregator of the Long Tail of knowledge\u0026rdquo; but those are the only ones of those \u0026ldquo;literally thousands\u0026rdquo; that he actually lists.\nWhat he means by his \u0026ldquo;literally thousands\u0026rdquo; becomes clear when he says that \u0026ldquo;a single blog that collects all the information that it can about a topic, let\u0026rsquo;s say needlework, is an aggregator\u0026rdquo; [89]. Well, if this is where his \u0026ldquo;literally thousands\u0026rdquo; of aggregators are coming from, count me underwhelmed. Amazon is one thing, and someone collecting links on needlework is another. I mean, Wal-Mart puts things on shelves and I put things on shelves, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me the same kind of thing as Wal-Mart. And although he mentioned needlework or \u0026ldquo;SEC filings or techno music\u0026rdquo; he does not actually list real sites. The wave of the future, it seems, is still intangible.\nAnderson does tease us again by claiming that \u0026ldquo;in this chapter, I\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the business aggregators. They fall mostly into five categories:\n Physical goods (eg Amazon, eBay)\n Digital goods (eg iTunes, iFilm)\n Advertising/services (eg Google, Craigslist)\n Information (eg Google, Wikipedia)\n Communities/user-created content (eg MySpace, Bloglines)\u0026rdquo; [89]\n  The rest of the chapter, however, is devoted to a discussion of just one aggregator \u0026ndash; Amazon (again!) with occasional mentions of old chums Netflix and Rhapsody. The fact that we are a third of the way into the book and, when it comes to specifics, Anderson keeps going back to the well to show us Amazon or Netflix one more time suggests that he is a little short of real examples, and that perhaps the aggregator model, while a powerful one for some people, is not something that is going to spawn large numbers of companies.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve already seen (earlier chapters) that while Amazon does make more money off its \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo; than individual brick and mortar stores, its figures are not spectacularly different after the downward revision between the original article and the published book, and that Rhapsody seems just as hit-dependent as HMV. When it comes down to it, we have here a short, limited list of examples which we\u0026rsquo;ve already seen provide little evidence for a significant Long Tail effect.\nHybrid versus Pure Digital [89-91] This section is devoted to a single rather obvious idea, which is that while it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cheap to sell physical goods from digital shelves (\u0026ldquo;hybrid retailer\u0026rdquo;), it\u0026rsquo;s even cheaper to sell digital goods from digital shelves (\u0026ldquo;pure digital retailer\u0026rdquo;) because such a good is just a row in a database table until someone orders it. This latter form of business is, he says \u0026ldquo;the holy grail of retail - near-zero marginal costs of manufacturing and distribution\u0026rdquo; [91]. Here, he actually mentions (unlike in the previous chapter) that it is marginal cost that is being minimized. He does not go on to point out that the industries with large fixed costs and tiny marginal costs tend to form oligopolies, but they do. It\u0026rsquo;s the main reason why there really aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;literally thousands\u0026rdquo; of aggregators and it\u0026rsquo;s why he has to go back to the same old examples over and over again. Fixed costs and other forms of increasing returns mean that there just aren\u0026rsquo;t that many of them.\nTripping Down the Tail [91-94] is also about Amazon (yawn), and shows how it is getting \u0026ldquo;closer and closer to breaking the tyranny of the shelf entirely\u0026rdquo; [94] by introducing Amazon Marketplace - a program in which the Amazon web site is a storefront for many small vendors (rather like eBay). \u0026ldquo;Retailers and distributors of any size, from specialty shops to individuals, could have their goods listed on Amazon.com just like the products in Amazon\u0026rsquo;s own warehouses - and the customers could buy either just as easily.\u0026rdquo; [93]\nAmazon Marketplace shows the real appeal of the aggregator business model, and it\u0026rsquo;s not about Long Tail, it\u0026rsquo;s about One Big Virtual Tent (see yesterday\u0026rsquo;s post). Why? Because the Amazon Marketplace model gets Amazon itself out of the physical shelf business, even though as Anderson writes, apparently without noticing the implications (he really is an incurable optimist) \u0026ldquo;With the Amazon Marketplace form of distributed inventory, the products are still on shelves around the country, but they are collectively catalogued and offered in one central place - Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Web site. Then, when people order them, the products are boxed up and shipped directly to the customer by the small merchants who have held the inventory all along\u0026rdquo; [94 - my emphasis] and if the goods don\u0026rsquo;t sell \u0026ldquo;Amazon bears none of the cost \u0026ndash; the surplus stock simply depreciates on the shelves of a third party\u0026rdquo; [94].\nIt is easy to see why this is a great deal for Amazon: they are using their market power to put the squeeze on the individual retailers whose very physical shelves are holding very physical products. Like Alibris, Amazon have put measures in place to prevent customers and sellers communicating directly. They are the ones in charge of this relationship.\nSo Amazon Marketplace is yet another story with at most a tenuous relationship to the Long Tail thesis. It provides Amazon with another source of revenue, but it is not clear if or how it moves overall customer demand to a Long Tail in any significant way. Sales of small items are gravy for a site with the huge web site resources of Amazon, but Anderson does not say how much business has been done on Amazon Marketplace, whether the small suppliers (for whom it is one more outlet) are gaining or losing overall from any move online that has happened, and so on. If, for example, there is a move to online purchase of the kind of goods found on Amazon Marketplace, then it could make sense for individual retailers to put their items there (because any sale is better than no sale) and yet be worse off than they were before Internet selling came along. It\u0026rsquo;s just shoddy writing. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get better.\nInventory on Demand [94-96] is yet more Amazon smoke and mirrors. By this time it is really getting silly. Anderson talks about Amazon\u0026rsquo;s big commitment to print on demand publishing as a way of selling all those niche books. But while he notes that \u0026ldquo;the potential of print-on-demand is extraordinary\u0026rdquo; [96] he doesn\u0026rsquo;t give any real-world numbers. How many print-on-demand books does Amazon sell? Not a clue. Will it help publishers get past the problem of returns from physical stores or does POD have its own problems? Who knows? Not Anderson, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. And then at the very end of the section he says that print-on-demand may also be useful for big sellers (hits) as well as niche products, so it may not actually \u0026ldquo;push demand down the long tail\u0026rdquo; at all. Remarkable.\nThe End of Inventory Altogether [96-97] is the final section of this chapter. It finally moves away from Amazon to talk about iTunes, Netflix and other pure-digital outlets as the wave of the future - which we have already seen are pretty hit-based. There is no doubt that the digital world is getting bigger, but this is not news. I for one am no cellulose sentimentalist and can\u0026rsquo;t wait for flexible electronic paper, but when it gets here I hope there is something more solid than The Long Tail to read on it.\nSo there we are. Another chapter, another lack of real substance to Anderson\u0026rsquo;s thesis. It is clear that there is money to be made by aggregators, but not at all clear that the coming of the aggregators is the coming of \u0026ldquo;infinite choice\u0026rdquo; [180].\n","date":1173131121,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"4b8c1d813e335f3fac29dd58c0b47c50","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/new_marketplace/","publishdate":"2007-03-05T21:45:21Z","relpermalink":"/post/new_marketplace/","section":"post","summary":"This is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, and it discusses Chapter 6 - The New Markets.

Part 0 is here. You can find a complete list of the Long Tail pieces here. You have to read upwards, in usual blog fashion. When I get to the end I hope to put these all together in one big file for download.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to take a breather and stop turning the pages of The Long Tail. I hope I\u0026rsquo;ve made the point now that there are a lot of problems with the book, a lot of places where (as John said) \u0026ldquo;It looks like his theory has become so obvious and inevitable to him that he sees the \u0026lsquo;revolution\u0026rsquo; coming even when the facts seem to point in the other direction.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s time to step back a bit. After all, even if much of The Long Tail is fluff, what about the idea at the heart of the book? Even if it takes only a few sentences to state instead of 240 pages, it could still be a penetrating insight that holds up despite the sloppiness of the supporting material. So the question is, if I don\u0026rsquo;t think the world of the Internet is Long Tail, what do I think it is like? Criticism can only take us so far without something constructive to put in its place.\nThe short answer to these questions are that I believe The Long Tail idea has merit only to the extent that the physical world is trapped in a digital vice of IT-driven big-box stores on the one hand and online stores on the other. Second, that to the extent a single image can be used to describe the world of the Internet, we could say that online commerce replaces a world of Many Little Tents by One Big Virtual Tent.\nThere is a lot of stuff under the One Big Virtual Tent, but that stuff is hard to find, there\u0026rsquo;s only one of it, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably based in California.\nThe core of the Long Tail hypothesis is that (i) Internet-based businesses, unencumbered by the tyranny of physical space, are able to make far more different products available than \u0026ldquo;bricks and mortar\u0026rdquo; stores, (ii) Internet-driven increased access to these niche products leads to greater demand for them - demand is driven down into the Long Tail, with the end result that (iii) we move from a market driven by hits or blockbusters to a market of niches. Finally (iv) this coming together of a diversity of tastes with a democracy of production is a think to be celebrated as a natural, unfiltered, and diverse outcome. The Internet brings an \u0026ldquo;explosion of variety\u0026rdquo; where \u0026ldquo;On the infinite aisle, everything is possible\u0026rdquo; [226].\nThe first thing to say is that (the title of this entry aside) to stretch one simple image over the entire Internet phenomenon - which Anderson does sometimes - cannot work and is of little use. It\u0026rsquo;s as if we tried to stretch a single image over the invention and development of the internal combustion engine. If you wanted to write a book in the early years of motorized transport talking about the future of business and of culture what would you say? Just that there were many futures to business. There were futures of families scattering across the miles as travel became easier, and of families overcoming distance to stay in touch. There were futures of homogeneity as economies of scale took hold, and futures of variety as people became exposed to influences from outside their own neighbourhood. There were futures of war and of peace, of great depressions, general strikes, longer lives, wonderful sights that could never be reached before. You get the idea. You just can\u0026rsquo;t take a phrase like The Long Tail and stick in on a development with such far-reaching implications as computerization and the Internet and apply it to everything without it losing all meaning. So the Long Tail in its broadest use is meaningless, and needs no competing theory to replace it.\nNarrowing the scope of the idea to something more manageable, a reasonable question is \u0026ldquo;will the shift to online commerce (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes) lead to a more diverse environment for cultural products?\u0026rdquo; I predict no with some qualifications. Such businesses are freed, as Anderson points out, from the constraints of geography. But geography, as Anderson admits from time to time, not only limits diversity, it is also a source of diversity. When we move our shopping online, the first physical stores to feel the pinch are not the Borders, Blockbuster, and Wal-Marts but are the smaller specialist sellers within physical communities. These specialist sellers are almost completely ignored by Anderson, as I\u0026rsquo;ve pointed out in the last several posts. Some specialist sellers will manage to thrive in the online world, but others (a computer book store in my town, for example) will be driven to the wall by online competition. To the extent that we abandon local businesses for online shopping, we lose rather than gain diversity.\nIf we are to compare the online world to the physical world we must do the job properly and compare all the online world to all the physical world. This is a difficult job, because the physical world is much more uneven than the online world: the economies of scale in the online world tend to create oligopolistic or even monopolistic markets in a way that outdoes even the Wal-Marts of the physical world, and Amazon is as accessible to people in small towns as it is to people in major cities. When looking at the availability of jazz music, for example, piefuchs\u0026rsquo; comment on Chapter 2 captures the difficulty of measuring the change:\nGrowing up in small-town NS I used to love to come to Boston to buy CDs - especially jazz. Now however, anyone can buy any CD on the web, but living here in Boston I can no longer go to a store see the same magnitude of selection, since every record store with a substantial new jazz department has closed. So are more people actually buying jazz instead of the blockbuster or are more people in small towns buying jazz on the web rather than when they travel?    The physical world is a world of heterogeneous variety, while the online world is a world of homogeneous variety. It is not clear that averages help very much when comparing physical apples to online oranges, but we can at least say that one thing you don\u0026rsquo;t do is compare Borders (or Chapters/Indigo, or Waterstones) to Amazon and claim you are comparing the physical and online worlds. The measurement biases of the book are pervasive and ignore the shift from a relatively heterogeneous retail environment in the physical world to a homogeneous retail environment in the online world. These biases are a big part of what make the book fundamentally wrong.\nThe other reason for my disbelief in the Long Tail is that it is not only the niches that benefit from being freed from \u0026ldquo;the tyranny of geography\u0026rdquo;. Hits benefit too. The phenomenon of movies opening simultaneously worldwide is possible only in a digital age. The possibility of such global rewards, especially when complemented by supply-side economies of scale and multiplied by synergistic products (the action figure and video game of the movie of the book) and given the fixed costs of producing digital content pushes markets towards the Short Head, not the Long Tail. The phenomenon of world-wide bestseller book releases is likewise a recent phenomenon (I believe, but confess I don\u0026rsquo;t have figures to back it up) and as John commented, there is evidence via Anderson\u0026rsquo;s weblog itself that midlist titles are struggling relative to hits in the bookselling market.\nOn the demand side too, there are forces that push us towards the Short Head. As Dipper pointed out in the comments to Chapter 1:\nOne reason people buy arts and cultural products such as books, dvd's, games, clothes, cars is to participate in cultural life. That means buying what other people are buying    The weakening of geographical constraints means that the definition of \u0026ldquo;other people\u0026rdquo; broadens out.\nWhat is the net result of these competing forces? The nearest I can see to a simple statement is that the online world is One Big Virtual Tent whereas the physical world is Many Little Tents. There\u0026rsquo;s little doubt that there is more variety under the One Big Tent than in any of the Many Little Tents (even the biggest of them). But is there more variety in the One Big Tent than in all the Many Little Tents together? Well, if you live close to only one little tent, the answer is undoubtedly Yes. If you live closer to a field crammed with Little Tents, then the answer may be No. And can you find what you want in the One Big Tent? Not yet would be my answer. Finding things online is a topic of Chapter 7 in the book, so there will be more to say there, but let\u0026rsquo;s just say that if you know what you are looking for you can find it on Amazon, but you are unlikely to come across, as I did in my public library, the strange and compelling stories of Agota Kristof by chance.\nIn comparing Many Little Tents with One Big Virtual Tent also need to look at geography at the level of nations as a source of diversity. As in so much else on this topic, my favourite reference is Blockbusters and Trade Wars, Popular Culture in a Globalized World by Peter Grant and Chris Wood. The theme of the book is the breaking down of trade and cultural barriers by commerce, including but not exclusively online commerce, and the attempts by smaller countries to preserve and enhance their own cultural output in the face of this challenge. They make a convincing case that a state-driven \u0026ldquo;cultural toolkit\u0026rdquo; including tools such as public broadcasting, quotas, subsidies, and more have been essential in helping a diversity of culture to survive and even, on occasion, thrive.\nNeedless to say, Anderson does not even begin to address issues of international cultural diversity beyond the fondness of online teenagers for Japanese anime films. Sitting in San Francisco, he does not seem to even notice the fact that there is a distinction to be made between American cultural consumption and that in other parts of the world. I wish I thought he had even heard of Grant and Wood, but they come from Canada so I would guess that he hasn\u0026rsquo;t. Google tells me that the only page outside this little corner of the Internet that mentions both \u0026ldquo;long tail\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;blockbusters and trade wars\u0026rdquo; is a bibliography page for a course on the Structure of the Book Publishing Industry in Canada from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. The ability of online vendors to cross borders is a double-edged sword when it comes to diversity. The ability to keep diversity in One Big Virtual Tent will depend to a large extent on the ability of governments to regulate portions of that tent.\nThere is one scenario in which the Long Tail does lead to an increase in diversity compared to the physical world, which is the scenario of the Digital Vice (I\u0026rsquo;ve renamed it since Chapter 1). The variety of physical stores that unevenly drive an uneven amount of uneven variety may be replaced by a combination of homogeneous big-box stores that sell mainly best-sellers and online stores that sell best-sellers and everything else. In such a world, there is no doubt that the niche purchases will take place online, so that the online world will represent a Long Tail compared to the physical world. But it\u0026rsquo;s a grim outcome nonetheless.\nThe second question here is, what about the Long Tail of production represented by YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and the world of blogs and Wikipedia? To some extent I tackled this in the discussion of Chapter 5. There are, I would argue, two things going on here, neither of which is Long Tail. One is the moving online of social conversations, play, and pastimes. Writing a diary online does not make it more \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; than writing a diary at home. The shift online loosens some ties and builds others. We tend to end up with (as Yochai Benkler points out in The Wealth of Networks) a looser but wider set of connections than in the physical world - we inhabit networks rather than communities, with different networks for different parts of our lives. Again, Anderson has eyes only for the building of online networks, not the loss of those other contacts that they replace. He repeatedly welcomes the online world in terms of its potential for a democratic future, but such a future is far from assured. To take one example, while the Internet is a great source of information for those who oppose the US war in Iraq, it has failed to coalesce into a significant political movement in the way that opposition to Vietnam did. The opposition to globalization that crystallized around 1999 did so at a physical place (Seattle): the effects of geography are strong and not easily replaced. While the Internet may provide new opportunities for political networking, to the extent that it replaces physical world actions it will not promote a broadening of democracy.\nThe most interesting and promising aspect of Internet technology is the large-scale collaborative efforts represented by the peer production models of Wikipedia, open-source software, SETI@home and others. These are remarkable, although again they tend to be operations that replace Many Small Tents by One Big Tent - there are fewer of them, but each one is bigger - than in the physical world. The endless comparisons of Encyclopedia Britannica to Wikipedia are somewhat misleading, because it again neglects the complementary physical books (specialist reference material that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get into Britannica) that do not exist in the online world. Is there a big online reference for birdwatchers? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but my guess is that the ease of use of Wikipedia will make it the equivalent of many offline reference works, rather than a single general-purpose encyclopedia. In the offline world, there is no longer a need for Small Tent production - just put your material into the One Big Tent. Again, does this represent greater variety? In some senses yes, in some senses no.\nSo if there is a single image I\u0026rsquo;d use instead of the Long Tail, it\u0026rsquo;s the One Big Virtual Tent. It\u0026rsquo;s a tent that holds more than any of the Many Small Tents of the physical world, but which does not guarantee an overall increase in variety. And if you\u0026rsquo;re going to build One Big Virtual Tent, the chances are you won\u0026rsquo;t be building it from an out of the way place - to that extent, the revenue from the homogeneous variety of the online world is going to be finding its way to Silicon Valley rather than to your local community.\n","date":1173009796,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"340fb29c3724b51ac16fd9e08557ef3c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/one_big_virtual/","publishdate":"2007-03-04T12:03:16Z","relpermalink":"/post/one_big_virtual/","section":"post","summary":"This is a part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail, although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t discuss any one chapter.

Part 0 is here. The previous part in this series is here.\nAt the beginning of this chapter [58] Anderson is back in storytelling mode, taking us to the Kamiokande II observatory in Japan to tell us how \u0026ldquo;one of the greatest astronomical discoveries of the twentieth century unfolded. A key theory explaining how the universe works was confirmed thanks to amateurs in New Zealand and Australia, a former amateur trying to turn professional in Chile, and professional physicists in the United States and Japan.\u0026rdquo; [60] The story shows, according both to British Think-Tank Demos and to astronomy author Timothy Ferris, that astronomy has shifted from \u0026ldquo;the old days of solitary professionals at their telescopes to a worldwide web linking professionals and amateurs\u0026rdquo; [60].\nLike the story of Touching the Void in Chapter 1, it is a story that is intriguing by itself, but which has very little relationship to the actual Long Tail thesis. The world of astronomy is a different world from that of Amazon.com. The book is about \u0026ldquo;The Future of Business\u0026rdquo; and yet astronomy is not a business. It\u0026rsquo;s about \u0026ldquo;a market of multitudes\u0026rdquo; [5], but there is nothing in this story about markets. It\u0026rsquo;s about the changes being brought about by the World Wide Web, but although Demos referred to a \u0026ldquo;worldwide web linking professionals\u0026rdquo; this story took place in 1987, before the World Wide Web was invented.\nThat is the weak point of this whole chapter: it tells us that amateur producers and volunteers have taken on a new importance in the world of the Internet but fails to show how this links to the rest of the book. In his original article Anderson did not talk about the production side of business at all. In short, this chapter is only tangentially related to the rest of the book. It looks as if Anderson needed material to fill out his 240 pages (this is one of the two longest chapters in the book), and so he bolted this on to the side. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit.\nSo when, as in this first section of the chapter, the book talks [61-62] about SETI@home (the use of spare cycles on home computers to search through large amounts of data in the search for extraterrestrial life) or \u0026ldquo;clickworkers\u0026rdquo; identifying craters on Mars, or even open source software \u0026ndash; all interesting subjects \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m going to be relentlessly negative and ask \u0026ldquo;what does this have to do with the rest of the book?\u0026rdquo;\nDemocratizing the Tools of Production [62-65] is all about how people can use their PC\u0026rsquo;s at home to engage in \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo;. Just like I\u0026rsquo;m doing now, in fact (I have a day off work). Anderson points us to the world of music - \u0026ldquo;Just as the electric guitar and the garage democratized pop forty years ago, desktop creation and production tools are democratizing the studio\u0026rdquo; [63], to the written word \u0026ldquo;aways the leading edge of egalitarianism\u0026rdquo; [63] and to photo editing and printing. He includes in his reach \u0026ldquo;video games that let people create and share their own alternative levels\u0026rdquo; and print-on-demand book publishing. Put together all these examples and it looks as if \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re starting to shift from being passive consumers to active producers\u0026rdquo; [63]. It\u0026rsquo;s an inspiring image and a common one these days. But again, and as in previous chapters, Anderson is being selective in his selection of examples as he seeks to bolster his thesis. There are two questions that we have to ask when confronted by this plethora of anecdotes.\nThe first is \u0026ldquo;What were these new producers (or their equivalents) doing before this new kind of activity came along?\u0026rdquo; They must have been doing something, after all. We know the answer, I suspect. Some of the time we were indeed watching TV (passive consumers). At other times, as Robert Putnam describes in \u0026ldquo;Bowling Alone\u0026rdquo;, we were engaged in other activities in or outside the home - local and community activities, whether it be a drink at the local bar or playing second clarinet in a Little Theatre production. A generation ago, the equivalent of those kids spending hours at their desktop digital music studio were probably producing music some other way. I don\u0026rsquo;t know of any study that shows that teenage participation in music-making has increased over the last decade. Maybe it has, maybe it hasn\u0026rsquo;t, but Anderson doesn\u0026rsquo;t even begin to make the case that it has, and pointing to PC software does not make the case.\nAnother question is about the definition of \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo;. The Internet is still a shiny new thing, and the things it gets used for are changing rapidly - and will continue to change. But just because something happens on the Internet doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it important, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo;. When I was young I used to make Airfix models of planes and tanks and so on, and I spent hours painting small metal figures of Napoleonic soldiers and creatures from Lord of the Rings. It was fun, but was it \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo;? Only in a very distorted view of the world. So what about Chris Anderson\u0026rsquo;s kids \u0026ldquo;who are, as I write, into machinima \u0026ndash; short computer-animated movies made with video game software\u0026hellip;. The first reaction of the kids was to watch and enjoy the machinima movies as entertainment. Their second was to express curiosity as to how they\u0026rsquo;re made. And their third was to ask if they could make on themselves (The answer, of course, is yes).\u0026rdquo; [64] Do the young Andersons\u0026rsquo; game-playing activities count as \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; any more than mine did? I suggest not. The fact that they are using a computer is not in and of itself very important.\nOr consider home photography. Twenty years ago we may have been sticking photos in scrapbooks rather than putting them on Flickr, but we should ask whether posting on Flickr is any more \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; than sticking pictures in scrapbooks. It is a more visible activity for researchers, for sure. It is easier to count the number of photos on Flickr than to count the number of photos in scrapbooks around the globe, and as a result it is tempting to identify this as new activity or an expanding one. But like the \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; of music it may well not be. It\u0026rsquo;s a shift of an activity from one medium, where it remains fairly private, to another where researchers can more easily access it. But that does not make it significantly different.\nThe end result is that, whereas Anderson sees the rise of a new expanded class of creative people: \u0026ldquo;millions of ordinary people have the tools and the role models to become amateur producers\u0026rdquo; [65], I suggest that those creative people have always been there, and have always been creating. It\u0026rsquo;s just that the Internet makes it more easy to count their creations.\nBut, I conveniently hear you say, what about blogging, where \u0026ldquo;millions of people publish daily for an audience that is collectively larger than any single mainstream media outlet can claim\u0026rdquo; [63]? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that production? Or what about Wikipedia, which competes with the Encylopedia Britannica? Surely that is production? Patience. That\u0026rsquo;s the next section.\nThe Wikipedia Phenomenon [65-67] is the first of four consecutive sections (ten pages) that talks about Wikipedia, the remarkable online encyclopedia. And remarkable it is. Even over the last few months, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself using it more and more as a first reference source for a wide variety of questions, from wireless network technologies (where it is very strong, unsurprisingly) to historical questions. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s great, sometimes not so much. But it is remarkable.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, Wikipedia counts as production. If it competes with the Encylopedia Britannica, which it does, then I\u0026rsquo;m happy to count it as bona fide production.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m still going to say that this ten-page section on Wikipedia does little for Anderson\u0026rsquo;s Long Tail thesis, for a few reasons. First, a glance at the index confirms that this is the first place in the book where Wikipedia has been mentioned, and it is mentioned in only scattered places later on. We haven\u0026rsquo;t seen it in the history of the long tail, or in the introductory chapter. Why not? Because like the astronomy story it isn\u0026rsquo;t an example of a market and it\u0026rsquo;s not a business. There has been a lot written about Wikipedia and other open-source content production; the best I\u0026rsquo;ve read is The Wealth of Networks, the exhaustive if sometimes heavy-going book by Yochai Benkler. Benkler describes Wikipedia as part of \u0026ldquo;the networked public sphere\u0026rdquo; - a public place that is provided by a network of loose collaborators. A public place is different from a commercial venture such as Amazon.com, and there is reason to believe that Wikipedia and Amazon are not part of the same thing.\nAnderson links Wikipedia into his Long Tail thesis by pointing out that, while the Encyclopedia Britannica has to draw a line at which \u0026ldquo;the priests\u0026hellip; decide \u0026lsquo;This is not worthy\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; [72], Wikipedia \u0026ldquo;just keeps going\u0026rdquo;. While Britannica has 80,000 entries, Wikipedia has well over a million on all kinds of obscure topics. These entries, from 80,000 to 1 million and beyond, are \u0026ldquo;the Tail\u0026rdquo; of Wikipedia [72]. This does look a little like a Long Tail. After all, Britannica is put on a physical shelf and Wikipedia isn\u0026rsquo;t. Britannica is pre-Internet and Wikipedia is Internet. So am I splitting hairs here when I say that Wikipedia is not \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo;? Aren\u0026rsquo;t these things enough to tie them together as part of \u0026ldquo;the same thing\u0026rdquo;? I\u0026rsquo;ll argue not, precisely because the Internet is so important. Its impact is so big, so multifarious, that it does little good to link up all Internet-related activities as if they are a single thing.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an analogy. In Chapter 3 Anderson told us about the expansion of supermarkets in post-World War America, and explained how this was a precursor of the Internet Long Tail, driven instead by a technologically-enhanced infrastructure of better transportation and communication. At the same time a huge collective endeavour was thriving - scientific research, which expanded manyfold from its pre-war scale. This too was enabled by new technologies of communication and transport, enabling people to move around and share information, and providing the ability to collaborate across the miles. And guess what? There is a long tail structure to scientific research too. It goes all the way from the hits (DNA structure, the discovery of the laser, and so on) down to those niche items that are of interest to only a few (improved helium-acetylene potential energy functions, as a non-random example). Whereas pre-war research focused on the hits, the new post-war institution \u0026ldquo;just keeps going\u0026rdquo;, exploring ever-more obscure backwaters of knowledge, some of which turn out to be surprisingly important. But does it make any sense to talk about scientific R\u0026amp;D and supermarkets as two parts of the post-war Long Tail? No. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to stop you from doing it, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really add anything to our understanding. In the same way, to see Wikipedia as a production-equivalent of Amazon and Netflix does not really help us.\nWikipedia and other large-scale collaborative ventures among both amateurs and professionals are best viewed as networked public goods, as Benkler describes them. The fact that they are big does not make them Long Tail. After all, take any large enterprise, break it into its constituent pieces, plot them along down an x axis in order of decreasing demand, and you are bound to see something like the long tail graph.\nSelf-Publishing Without Shame [75-78] follows Anderson\u0026rsquo;s discussion of Wikipedia (some of which I am skipping over, having said quite enough I think) and presents a different view of what lots of little-looked-at content can be on the Internet. There are, you will be shocked to hear, things I agree with in this section. He writes about blogs, other forms of self-publishing, and \u0026ldquo;citizen journalism\u0026rdquo; (especially South Korea\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;OhmyNews\u0026rdquo; [78]) and points to these areas as a \u0026ldquo;crucible of creativity, a place where ideas form and grow before evolving into commercial form\u0026rdquo;. This makes sense. Barnes \u0026amp; Noble CEO says it this way: \u0026ldquo;Over the next few years, the traditional definition of what a \u0026lsquo;published\u0026rsquo; book is will have less meaning. Individuals will increasingly use the Internet as a first stage to publish their work\u0026hellip; The best of this work will turn into physical books.\u0026rdquo; [77] This view of blogs and other web-based forms of expression as \u0026ldquo;first-step publishing\u0026rdquo; or pre-commercial publishing seems realistic.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get carried away with this constructive and positive view of the Long Tail, so let me revert to negativism and point out that this interpretation of what is happening in the world of blogs and other self-publication is not what he has been talking about in the earlier part of the book. First, to see these DIY areas of self-publishing and social networks as a pool from which hits will be picked is quite different from saying that demand is shifting to niche products. Second, he says \u0026ldquo;Blogs are a Long Tail\u0026rdquo; [69] but blogs are a non-commercial space for unmediated discussion and opinion. That\u0026rsquo;s great, but the non-commercial nature of it sets it apart from most of what he is talking about as the Long Tail (an infinite shelf of commercial items for sale). The border between non-commercial and commercial parts of the Internet are blurred and changing, but there is still a border. It is not clear, for example, that Wikipedia contributors would continue to contribute if a company \u0026ldquo;owned\u0026rdquo; their product and made money off it. It is not clear that bloggers would contribute if others took their content and re-used it for money. Cases are appearing where photographers are complaining about the commercial use of their freely-produced images. The issues of rights and ownership are thorny and there will be years of debate to sort them out.\nCase Study: Lonely Island [78-82] reverts to story-telling mode for the case of comedy troupe Lonely Island. It starts with media mogul Barry Diller scoffing at the idea that peer production, or \u0026ldquo;18 million people producing stuff they think will have appeal\u0026rdquo; could rival Hollywood and then tells how Lonely Island took their act online and found success after being picked up by Saturday Night Live. The lesson of the story is \u0026ldquo;on one hand, the existing entertainment industry filters did recognize the appeal of the Lonely Island and found a way to tap it. In that sense, maybe the system works. Yet if three kids with a video camera doing goofy raps and putting them on their web site isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;18 million people producing stuff they think will have appeal\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; I really don\u0026rsquo;t know what is.\u0026rdquo; [81] It is a weak story, of the same kind as the earlier Touching the Void - the Internet as source for successful acts. I could tell the story of unsigned singer Billy Bragg hearing that DJ John Peel was hungry and taking a curry to the recording studio, getting a few tracks played on the show in return, and finding himself on the way to stardom. It\u0026rsquo;s not the Internet, but if it\u0026rsquo;s not someone producing stuff they think will have appeal, well I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is. The point is, there is no point.\nThe Architecture of Participation [82-84] finishes the chapter in bizarre fashion by acknowledging that \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ve seen parts of this story before\u0026rdquo; and talking about punk rock and its \u0026ldquo;anyone can do it\u0026rdquo; attitude. I do wish he would turn back a few pages to where he told us that the \u0026lsquo;70s and \u0026lsquo;80s were the years of blockbuster culture: now it\u0026rsquo;s the start of an architecture of participation. And the punk rock story is a good reminder that, for all the mashups and videos on the Internet, there is not a single artistic movement to have come from the Internet culture that rivals punk in its impact. Lonely Island comedy troupe just doesn\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the chapter. For anyone still reading, I want to add one thing about production of digital goods that Anderson does not mention, which is that while it does make certain kinds of production cheaper, it also tends to create \u0026ldquo;winner take all\u0026rdquo; markets as described by Robert Frank and Philip Cook, also explained in detail in Blockbusters and Trade Wars by Peter Grant and Chris Wood. The fact that the marginal cost of additional copies of a digital good are basically free to create, whether the first copy cost $1 or $100 million, has a number of consequences. One is that \u0026ldquo;cultural products that are attractive to consumers in a large geographical market have a lower risk and a much greater potential reward than do those that are produced for a smaller market\u0026rdquo; [Grant and Wood, p. 55] Here is a force that, as they describe, tend to constrain choice rather than promote it. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into this in detail here - just to say that (as John pointed out in a great comment on Chapter 3) - there are winner take all forces at work in cultural industries that push demand away from the \u0026ldquo;Long Tail\u0026rdquo;, which are ignored by Anderson.\n[Just to finish in a really picky way, Anderson says of Wikipedia \u0026ldquo;There are the popular top 1,000 [articles], which can be found in any encyclopedia: Julius Caesar, World War II, Statistics, etc.\u0026rdquo; [72]. He is being selective again: according to a list linked to from Wikipedia itself, the most viewed articles in the English language version in February 2007 were (ignoring home page and other non-article pages): Anna Nicole Smith, Wiki, Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, Wikipedia, United States, Naruto (a Japanese anime series), Chinese New Year, World War II, Sex, Deaths in 2007, List of Pokemon, List of Sexual Positions, Sexual Intercourse, Category: Female Porn Stars, and Barak Obama. How many of these top articles have entries in Britannica?]\n","date":1172524466,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"6a48d369ad8d4e8e6fc91831b1610b61","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_new_produce/","publishdate":"2007-02-26T21:14:26Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_new_produce/","section":"post","summary":"This is a part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and discusses \u0026ldquo;Chapter 5 - The New Producers\u0026rdquo;.

Part 0 is here. The previous part in this series is here.\nChapter 4 is a really short chapter (6 pages, including 3 diagrams and a table) which sketches the three forces of the Long Tail (and also the six themes of the Long Tail age - what is it with numbers?) Subsequent chapters talk about each force in turn. So this is a really short post as well.\nGiven that it is short, this might be a good place to put the canonical picture of the Long Tail. So here it is.\nThe idea is that you arrange a set of products in decreasing order of popularity along the horizontal axis, and plot their popularity up the vertical axis. The first few are the most popular items (the hits) and as you go to the right you go past many individually less and less popular items. There are a lot of items in the yellow area, and while there is not much demand for any individual one of them, it is possible for some shapes of graph that there is more total demand (a bigger area under the graph) in the tail (yellow area) than in the head (green area). The Long Tail idea is that the Internet is pushing demand away from the hits in the green area and into the yellow area of the Long Tail.\nBefore goods can be put on shelves, they have to be made, and so Anderson identifies the first force of the Long Tail as \u0026ldquo;democratizing the tools of production. The best example of this is the personal computer, which has put everything from the printing press to the film and music studios in the hands of anyone.\u0026rdquo; [54] In this definition Anderson fails to distinguish two separate aspects to cost. One is the cost of making the first copy of something - be it a tube of toothpaste or a blog post like this - and the second is the marginal cost of making subsequent copies. It may cost a few hundred or a few thousand dollars for a student to make a short film while it can cost over $100 million for a major movie studio to make a big production. But making the second copy of each one costs the same. Anderson focuses, here and in the next chapter, on those technologies that make it easier for many people to make cheap films (and so on) - hence that loaded word \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo;. But price is not determined by that cost, it is determined by marginal cost - the cost of that second (or thousandth, or millionth) copy. It cost me about as much to watch Jim Jarmusch\u0026rsquo;s shoestring-budget Coffee and Cigarettes as it cost me to watch Return of the King. We\u0026rsquo;ll see in the next chapter that this overlooked distinction makes a big difference to the story of production in the digital world.\nThe second force is \u0026ldquo;cutting the costs of consumption by democratizing distribution\u0026rdquo; [55]. It\u0026rsquo;s the part of the story that Chapter 1 focused on - how companies such as Amazon and Netflix can exploit the Internet to more effectively distribute goods. The Internet, he argues \u0026ldquo;makes everyone a distributor\u0026rdquo; [55]. But it takes more than a computer to get a little homemade video seen by hundreds of thousands of people, it takes You Tube. It takes more than an Internet connection to buy and sell an obscure piece of jewellery, it takes eBay. Not everyone is a distributor - in fact the economics of the Internet is likely to decrease the number of distributors rather than increase them. Chapter 6 looks at \u0026ldquo;democratizing distribution\u0026rdquo;.\nThe third and final force is \u0026ldquo;connecting supply and demand\u0026rdquo; [55] - those recommendations, links, and so on that help us to find things we like on the Internet. Those recommendations, perhaps most effectively on eBay where trust is such an issue, have helped Internet ventures overcome some big obstacles. But when he says \u0026ldquo;The other thing that happens when consumers talk amongst themselves is that they discover that, collectively, their tastes are far more diverse than the marketing plans being fired at them suggest\u0026rdquo; [56-57] we can see that there is a big hole right ahead of him on the path Anderson is walking. People have, after all, talked amongst themselves for a long time. Does the Internet increase the level of consumer talk and so increase its usefulness as a mechanism for identifying niche tastes, or does it simply replace one forum for talking (face to face) with another (Internet-mediated)? Chapter 7 looks at tastemakers on the Internet, where we will see if Anderson falls into the hole or not.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s two short posts, pretty light on substance. Tomorrow I should have a longer one with a bit more to it.\n","date":1172433576,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"380b8c3009d13e43d6ed8fdca5215f9c","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/this_is_a_part_/","publishdate":"2007-02-25T19:59:36Z","relpermalink":"/post/this_is_a_part_/","section":"post","summary":"This is a part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and discusses \u0026ldquo;Chapter 4 - The Three Forces of The Long Tail\u0026rdquo;.

Part 0 is here. The previous part in this series is here.\nChapter 3 is a complement to Chapter 2 and completes Part One of the book (although it\u0026rsquo;s not labelled as such). While Chapter 2 set out to chart the rise and fall of the blockbuster, Chapter 3 charts the rise and rise of the Long Tail in a short ten page trip from the Sears Catalogue the web and beyond. It\u0026rsquo;s a short chapter, and a digression from the main thread of the book, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have a whole lot to say about it. But I said I\u0026rsquo;d go through chapter by chapter so I will.\nThe first section describes the rise of the Sears Wish Book and the catalogue retailing business. The catalogue allowed people - especially those in small towns and rural areas (as piefuchs pointed out in comments on the previous part) - to choose from a much wider range of goods than ever before (200,000 in the 1897 Wish Book [43]) because the catalogue replaced physical shelves in physical stores. \u0026ldquo;With the heavy thunk of a single mail drop, the choice of available products increased a thousandfold from the typical inventory at the general store\u0026rdquo;. Sears was able to do this because, like Wal-Mart many years later, it introduced new efficiencies into its management of the supply chain. Big warehouses in Chicago together with \u0026ldquo;virtual\u0026rdquo; warehouses that were its network of suppliers meant that they could stock items efficiently. It was a big change. The Sears Catalogue has several parallels to the online world that Anderson calls \u0026ldquo;the ultimate catalog\u0026rdquo;. One that he does not mention is that it was not easily mimicked. Once there is a big catalogue, a second big catalogue doesn\u0026rsquo;t help much. The cost of keeping an item on the virtual shelf \u0026ndash; whether that be a catalogue or a web server \u0026ndash; is small, but the cost of building a virtual shelf in the first place is actually pretty big, and once someone\u0026rsquo;s built a good one it is difficult to compete with them.\nFeeding the Tail [44-46] describes how supermarkets did the same thing as the Sears Catalogue had done years before - provided \u0026ldquo;greater variety, lower prices, and one-stop shopping\u0026rdquo; [45]: basically they exploited economies of scale. In fact, Anderson tells us the supermarket took off during the 1950s and 1960s: those years of \u0026ldquo;lockstep culture\u0026rdquo;[29] described in Chapter 2 did after all have another side to them and that side was variety - in the form of thousands of items on the shelves of the supermarket. It is worth reflecting on these parallel stories that Anderson is telling us. To characterize the 1950s as an age of mass culture and then to describe the rise of a culture of variety at the same time does raise questions. It is often said that the plural of anecdote is not data, and this chapter reminds us why. There are many stories in this world, stories that are true and which can illustrate any message you want to deliver. But stories by themselves are not enough to support broad conclusions. The chapter also reminds us that there are other sides to our current day culture in addition to the availability of lots of online books. We\u0026rsquo;ll see more of what those are in later chapters, but Wal-Mart is, as pointed out in the discussion of Chapter 1, just as much a creature of the modern technological world as Amazon.\nThe Touchstone Customer [45-46] is a digression on how new technology \u0026ndash; toll-free calling and credit cards \u0026ndash; led to a resurgence in catalogue shopping, again by making it easier for sellers to present a wide selection of items to their customers, but it is The Ultimate Catalog [47-49] that brings to the real point of the chapter, describing Jeff Bezos building the Amazon enterprise. The discussion shows how the book market has some properties (a number of products too large for even the bulkiest paper catalogue, a mature wholesaling and distribution system, a product that doesn\u0026rsquo;t decay in the warehouse) that made it the ideal place for Internet commerce to start. There are, it suggests, particular things about books that make them special when it comes to online selling. To the extent that is true, the success of Amazon may not indicate \u0026ldquo;the future of business\u0026rdquo;. The success of Amazon is real, of course, although its profitability has been erratic. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting story. But if a book is put on a web page, does that make it a product? Given Anderson\u0026rsquo;s failure in the early chapters to show a really significant shift of purchasing patterns between the offline and online worlds to a new Long Tail world, the story is interesting, but what lessons we learn from it are not so clear.\nThe final section of the chapter, Long Tails Everywhere [50-51] is, like the Tails Everywhere section of the Introduction, a bizarre leap that stretches the idea of the Long Tail to breaking point and beyond. Getting carried away, Anderson writes (without further justification or description) of open source projects as \u0026ldquo;the Long Tail of programming talent\u0026rdquo;, offshoring as the Long Tail of Labor, microbreweries as the Long Tail of beer, customized clothing as the Long Tail of fashion, online universities as the Long Tail of education, internet porn as the Long Tail of pornography, and al Qaeda as the Long Tail of warfare. Superficially attractive, such examples have no unifying mechanism underlying them and often little justification in terms of actual change. Was the Spanish Civil War any less Long Tail, whatever that means in this context, than 9\u0026frasl;11? If offshoring is the Long Tail of labor are suburbs the Long Tail of cities? As for the resurgence of microbreweries, my explanation of that is here, and it has nothing to do with the cost of shelf space. Anderson provides no explanation of how microbreweries fit into his ideas, what shelves are longer and why. I know from experience that when you work on a project for a long time it is tempting to see the whole world through the lens of the ideas you are working on, but in this section Anderson needed an editor to haul him back from the edge.\nChapter 2, particularly in its final pages, opens questions about what Anderson really means by The Long Tail. He gives several different definitions throughout the book from narrow to broad, but, getting ahead of ourselves for a minute, perhaps the best summary sentence is that at the beginning of Chapter 4, where he says that the Long Tail is \u0026ldquo;shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of hits (mainstream products and markets) at the head of the demand curve, and moving toward a huge number of niches in the tail.\u0026rdquo; One thing about this definition is that it identifies the Long Tail as an economic phenomenon - it\u0026rsquo;s about supply and demand, buying and selling - and as a shift - a change from a previous narrower market to some newer market. Interpreting the Long Tail in a non-economic and static sense as \u0026ldquo;variety\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;large number of t hings\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail is nothing more than infinite choice\u0026rdquo; [180]) makes it so broad as to lose any useful meaning. Casual soccer games are not part of the Long Tail of Soccer just because there are a lot of them being played in different places; my desk is not a Long Tail of Paper just because it\u0026rsquo;s a mess of many different pieces of paper; and saying that \u0026ldquo;offshoring taps the Long Tail of labor\u0026rdquo; [50] adds nothing new or useful to discussions of changes in the patterns of international labour.\nBy the end of this chapter, Anderson considers that he has shown that the Long Tail is a real phenomenon and has both a history and a future. He\u0026rsquo;s ready to move on to the mechanisms that give it shape in the next chapter. The thing about a book is, if you disagree with the setup (and as I hope I have shown in these postings, there are enough weak points in Anderson\u0026rsquo;s description to make the reality and significance of the Long Tail highly questionable) it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to go on. Discussion of mechanisms assumes a real phenomenon. It will be challenging to write about that without becoming repetitive.\n","date":1172354808,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"7e1e3e6f5a826f88ac4fb958e92dad47","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/a_short_history/","publishdate":"2007-02-24T22:06:48Z","relpermalink":"/post/a_short_history/","section":"post","summary":"Back from doing some actual work for a few days, this is another part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and discusses \u0026ldquo;Chapter 3 - A Short History of the Long Tail\u0026rdquo;.

Part 0 is here. The previous part in this series is here.\nA book that paints a big picture, as The Long Tail does, and especially if it is paints using an informal, storytelling brush, can be difficult to refute. Point out the problems with any one story and you can be accused of splitting hairs \u0026ndash; that one story is just a little piece of the picture, and if it\u0026rsquo;s a bit inaccurate then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the basic thesis. On the other hand, if you make big claims and say that \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s all wrong\u0026rdquo; you lose as well, because that\u0026rsquo;s unconvincing. So if you really want to refute a book (and yes, reader, that is what I want to do) then you\u0026rsquo;ve got to go through it page by page, example by example, and make your case.\nA big picture really does have to be backed up by real data and real mechanisms somewhere, and the onus is on the author to provide that data and those mechanisms. Anderson fails to do so in The Long Tail. If you construct a theory (and Anderson calls the Long Tail a theory, even though I\u0026rsquo;d argue it\u0026rsquo;s not) and that theory is to hold water, then sooner or later there has to be something solid to it.\nBy Chapter 2 I was beginning to wonder where the solid foundation for The Long Tail could be found. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen how, in the Introduction and in Chapter 1, the book flits between engaging stories (Touching the Void, the 98 percent rule), ad hoc comparisons that hide as much as they reveal (Rhapsody vs. Wal-Mart, the coming-of-age teenage choice comparison) and generalizations. And so goes Chapter 2. It\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s completely wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s that enough of it is inaccurate or misleading to make the big picture melt away like a snowman in the sun.\nThe main argument of Chapter 2 is that, as the final sentence tells us \u0026ldquo;we are turning from a mass market back into a niche nation, defined not by geography but by interests\u0026rdquo; [40]. Yet the content of the chapter shows only that the past contained a mass market culture (among other things) and the present contains niches (among other things). This is not the same at all. You cannot demonstrate a transition by listing all those aspects of the 1950\u0026rsquo;s that were mass market and all those aspects of today that are niche - you have to ask if there were niches back then and if there are mass markets today. And that\u0026rsquo;s where Anderson fails. He just lists examples of mass-market 1950s things and 2007 niche things. It\u0026rsquo;s not enough.\nSo, now to the page-by-page look at the chapter.\nThe first few pages of the chapter are a caricature of a cultural history of the USA: of how culture has changed from a predominantly local agrarian structure (pre-industrial revolution) through the growth of urban \u0026ldquo;mass culture\u0026rdquo; in the 20th century, to the \u0026ldquo;end of the hit parade\u0026rdquo; as the twenty-first century opens. It describes the 1950\u0026rsquo;s as \u0026ldquo;the ultimate in lockstep culture\u0026rdquo; [29] - an image of grey, authoritarian conformism \u0026ndash; and there were indeed aspects of the culture that showed such a shared and \u0026ldquo;lockstep\u0026rdquo; trend - \u0026ldquo;by 1954, an astounding 74 percent of TV households were watching I Love Lucy every Sunday night\u0026rdquo;.\nEven here we should remember that in 1954 TV was in its infancy - a third of households did not have one. And an accurate picture of the 1950s would include the fact there was another aspect of society that declined from the 1970\u0026rsquo;s on, and that was the \u0026ldquo;collapse of American community\u0026rdquo; documented so well by Robert Putnam in Bowling Alone. A whole set of diverse community activities was available in the 1950\u0026rsquo;s that is not present now, and Anderson does not mention this. Putnam \u0026ldquo;draws on evidence including nearly 500,000 interviews over the last quarter century to show that we sign fewer petitions, belong to fewer organizations that meet, know our neighbors less, meet with friends less frequently, and even socialize with our families less often.\u0026rdquo; Anderson says that the TV data show that \u0026ldquo;watercooler effect, the phrase describing the buzz in the office around a shared cultural event\u0026rdquo; peaked in the 1950s and 1960s, because \u0026ldquo;it was a safe assumption that nearly everyone in your office had watched the same thing the previous night\u0026rdquo;. But this neglects all those other social activities documented by Putnam, which were more prevalent at that time and which were also markers of diversity.\nSo a more accurate picture might be that there was the growth of one form of mass culture (TV) at a time when other variegated activities were still present. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how the arithmetic works out (and there\u0026rsquo;s an apples vs. oranges quality to it of course) but the onus here is on Anderson to prove his case, and he is being selective in his evidence. It is easy to point at the 1950\u0026rsquo;s as lockstep conformism if you focus only on those aspects of culture that were common and if you neglect all those that were diverse. And this is what he does.\nEven as he goes on into the world of music [30] he draws the same caricature-like portrait. He says how \u0026ldquo;The [hit-making] machine [that was radio] hit its peak in the form of American Top 40, a syndicated weekly radio show started by Casey Kasem in 1970. It began as a three-hour program that counted down the topforty songs on Billboard\u0026rsquo;s Hot 100 singles chart\u0026hellip; For a generation of kids who grew up in the seventies and eighties, this was the carrier signal of pop culture.\u0026rdquo;[30]\nNow I grew up in the UK, not the US, so maybe things were a little different, but (as I\u0026rsquo;ve already touched on in the previous chapter) things were not this monolithic. We too had out Sunday evening Top Countdown (hosted by Alan \u0026ldquo;Fluff\u0026rdquo; Freeman, pop-pickers) and my brothers and I listened to it regularly, as did a lot of other people. But was it \u0026ldquo;the carrier signal of pop culture\u0026rdquo;? No. There are two carrier signals for pop culture - the media and word of mouth. The cool kids were all listening to John Peel from 10 to midnight or to Radio Luxembourg and the rest of us listened to the charts and then got the pointers from our cooler friends as to what\u0026rsquo;s the newest on the alternative side of the music spectrum. So whether you were a Genesis lover or a Black Sabbath follower or whatever, even in those early 1970s there was a variety of tastes around. Anderson is suffering (have I said this often enough?) from a convenient selective vision when he paints his picture of the past.\nThe End of the Hit Parade [31-32] charts the turn away from mass culture. It is built around a graph that shows the number of hit albums (gold, platinum, multiplatinum and diamond) in each year. The graph shows shows a fairly steady rise from 1957 to 2002 followed by a rapid fall-off after 2002. This turn is explained as follows: \u0026ldquo;Between 2001 and 2005, the music industry\u0026rsquo;s total sales fell by a quarter. But the number of hit albums fell by nearly half. In 2000, the top five albums\u0026hellip; sold a combined 38 million copies. In 2005, the top five sold just half that; only 19.7 million copies. In other words, although the music industry is hurting, the hit-making side of it is hurting more. Customers have shifted to less mainstream fare, fragmenting to a thousand different subgenres.\u0026rdquo; [32-33]\nLike so many other figures and paragraphs in the book, this sounds convincing but does not hold up to closer inspection. Anderson is right that \u0026ldquo;so mething happened\u0026rdquo; in the first years of the century, and that the something was, as he says, digital music. One consequence of the shift to digital, we all know, was a move away from buying albums and towards buying individual songs. Here is a paragraph from today\u0026rsquo;s (February 18, 2007) Sunday Toronto Star:\n\"Individual tracks are clearly driving the business,\" was the _Entertainment Marketing Letter_'s assessment of the music industry's health at the end of 2006. \"Album sales were down by 4.9% in both digital and physical formats to 588 million from 619 million in 2005, while 22 tracks were downloaded more than 1 million times each versus two the previous year.\"    By showing only albums on his chart, Anderson cannot distinguish between two effects of digital music. The first is a shift to individual songs from albums, and the second, to be proven, is the shift of purchases towards a long tail of niche markets. He claims the change is all about The Long Tail, but the quotation above makes it clear that the shift away from albums may have a big effect too. I can\u0026rsquo;t say which one is the more important, except to note that the evidence from comparing HMV and Rhapsody shows little \u0026ldquo;shift to the tail\u0026rdquo;. It is a topic that Anderson returns to later, and I hope present more evidence when I get to those chapters that the Long Tail effect appears to be muted, at least. And anyway, to be frank, the onus is on Anderson to prove his case and yet again, by his choice of comparison, he has failed to do so.\nWho Killed the Hit Album? [33-35] is another section about trends in music; this is a digression on the factors behind the shift to the Long Tail, a shift which is yet to be proven. It is a descriptive section with few data except for music sharing among music fans (which do seem very diverse) and a glimpse into the subgenres that Rhapsody promotes. The remainder is a plausibility argument about people having many different tunes on their iPods. There\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot to be said about this couple of pages.\nBroadcast Blues [35-38] moves the discussion from music to the real problems of radio, and thence on to other areas of culture. It claims to show that \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening in music is paralleled in practically every other sector of mass media and entertainment. Consider these statistics from 2005:\n Hollywood box office fell by 7 percent\u0026hellip;\n Newspaper readership \u0026hellip; fell by 3 percent\u0026hellip;\n Magazine newsstand sales are at their lowest levels\u0026hellip; in more than thirty years.\n Network TV ratings continue to fall.\u0026rdquo;[37]\n  But these figures do not parallel the shift away from hits that he claimed to have seen in music (albeit without good foundation, as I have shown). The drop in newspaper readership and magazine newsstand sales do not mark a shift from a hit parade to a niche market, although they do mark a move away from physical media to the Internet. The two are not the same: if I stopped buying This Magazine and instead got my social commentary from CNN Online I would be moving towards, not away from, a mass culture. It is clear, to repeat, that the Internet is important and is changing things. What is not clear is whether the shift from hits to the Long Tail is real, or in which cases it is real, and what the magnitude and importance of such a shift (if it exists) would be.\nThe final section is A Hit-Drive Economy is a Hit-Driven Culture [38-40]. It argues that the structure of current media corporations is built around hits. Drawing on the well known fact that predicting hits is difficult (or, as Grant and Wood say \u0026ldquo;nobody knows\u0026rdquo;) it argues that \u0026ldquo;existing media and entertainment industries are still oriented around finding, funding, and creating blockbusters\u0026rdquo; [38] with bad effects on the quality of the end product (a favouring of safe sequels over risky products) - a claim I have no argument with. As Anderson says, this fixation on hits has \u0026ldquo;leaked outside of the Hollywood boardrooms into our national culture\u0026rdquo; 39. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I want Anderson to be wrong - I\u0026rsquo;d love a world of \u0026ldquo;groups bound together more by affinity and shared interests than by default broadcast schedules\u0026rdquo; [40] and I\u0026rsquo;d love it is we were \u0026ldquo;turning from a mass market back into a niche nation\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s just that wishing it to be so doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it so, and it is far from clear that the operations of, for example, Rupert Murdoch\u0026rsquo;s News Corp. (owner of the social networking site myspace.com) will take us there.\nAt the end of this chapter, are we any further ahead than at the beginning? Not really. We have seen that there is a real shift from physical to digital and that some shared \u0026ldquo;blockbuster\u0026rdquo; experiences of earlier decades (network TV in particular) have become diluted. But we have not seen evidence of a real shift away from a mass culture to a niche culture, partly because Anderson ignores those aspects of times past that were richest in niches (civic engagement, local organizations, and so on as documented in Bowling Alone) and partly because his data (musically with album charts) do not demonstrate that people are really moving to the niches as they move online. It may be so, and there are forces pushing us in that direction, but as we shall see in later posts there are forces pushing us back the other way too, towards a hit-based, celebrity-based culture. Which one wins in what cases is up for grabs.\nPostings will probably slow until the weekend, when I can spend more time on this project again.\n","date":1171914215,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"703bbfca7beab2e0186fad4cf1153693","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/this_is_part_of/","publishdate":"2007-02-19T19:43:35Z","relpermalink":"/post/this_is_part_of/","section":"post","summary":"This is part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and discusses \u0026ldquo;Chapter 2 - The Rise and Fall of the Hit\u0026rdquo;.

Part 0 is here. The previous part in this series is here.\nChapter 1 starts with the story of the mountaineering book Touching the Void being lifted from obscurity a decade after its publication by online recommendations at Amazon.com. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice story, and while I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the book, the film of Touching the Void is gripping and moving. But what does this story tell us? \u0026ldquo;By combining infinite shelf space with real-time information about buying trends and public opinion, they [online booksellers] created the entire Touching the Void phenomenon\u0026hellip; Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it.\u0026rdquo; [16]\nBut this is, after all, just a story, and this is not the first time a product has been lifted from obscurity by a sudden word of mouth. In fact, the opening pages of The Tipping Point feature a story that is very similar - the return of Hush Puppies into style after an extended period in the commercial wilderness, as a result of word of mouth in the New York club scene and then fashion scene. And the Hush Puppy story has nothing to do with infinite shelf space - it may have more to do with second hand and unfashionable clothes stores where the first few people could get their Hush Puppies, before they became trendy again. It is tempting to start thinking \u0026ldquo;yes, but maybe those tiny stores represent a Long Tail of fashion\u0026rdquo; but that would be to miss the point of the book, which is that the phenomenon is new and coming from digital technologies. To interpret the Long Tail as \u0026ldquo;variety\u0026rdquo; leaves us with nothing but an appreciation of the diversity of the physical world (whose tyranny the infinite digital shelf space will release us from). The world does have a lot of variety, but that is not exactly a new observation. So as in the story about 20 kinds of flour in his introduction, we have to be careful about drawing lessons from Touching the Void, however fine the film is.\nThe Tyranny of Locality [17-18] is the beginning of this first outline of what The Long Tail actually means. And it is clear that there may be something here. There are limits to much retailing as a consequence of \u0026ldquo;the need to find local audiences\u0026rdquo;. Geographically dispersed individuals with a taste for something non-mainstream (such as Bollywood movies in the USA) may find their tastes unmet because there are not enough of them in any one place to make it commercially viable to sell to them. The online world allows them to be sold without regard for geography (within a single country anyway, because of shipping) and so may allow more such non-mainstream products to find an audience. Another reason that geography is so limiting is that in the physical world there is \u0026ldquo;not enough shelf space\u0026rdquo; to carry everything; not enough screens to show all movies, not enough channels to broadcast all the TV shows [18]. The digital world promises to free us from this: \u0026ldquo;This is the world of scarcity. Now, with online distribution and retail, we are entering a world of abundance. The differences are profound.\u0026rdquo;\nThis, then, is the beginnings of the hypothesis. Let\u0026rsquo;s think about two things that might also be going on, not discussed here. One is that there has been a long tradition of getting round some of the limits of the physical world. Anderson quotes The Triplets of Belleville as a movie that was critically acclaimed and yet \u0026ldquo;opened on just six screens nationwide\u0026rdquo; [17]. Yet the movie did appear right here in the small city where I live, in physical space, on the local arts cinema. So here is a mechanism (the smaller independent cinema) for diluting the tyranny of space, and it is a mechanism that may actually be threatened by the onset of digital distribution. Or may not - some have struggled and others prospered. The existence of independent arts cinemas in the physical world is a reminder that that world is not as homogeneous as Anderson portrays it.\nThe second phenomenon is to do with fixed against marginal costs. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to say much about this here (we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to it in a few chapters) but there are things about digital distribution that are different from the physical world in addition to the length of the shelves. Will these other things mess up the Long Tail hypothesis? We\u0026rsquo;ll see. (hint, yes to a degree, although not entirely). For now, again, let\u0026rsquo;s just remind ourselves as we read that this is a hypothesis, not a theory.\nMarkets Without End [19-24] talks more about the world of abundance, painting a picture of the long shelf of the new digital world against that of the old constrained physical world. Anderson looks at the Rhapsody online music retail service owned by RealNetworks, whose CEO blurbed the book and compares it to Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s CD offerings.\nWal-Mart carries about 4,500 unique CD titles, but Anderson shows by looking at Rhapsody\u0026rsquo;s download data that demand for titles outside that number continues out to at least the 800,000th title (downloaded a few times). \u0026ldquo;Individually, none of those songs is popular, but there are just so many of them that collectively they represent a substantial market\u0026hellip; From the perspective of a store like Wal-Mart, the music industry stops at less than 60,000 tracks. However, for online retailers like Rhapsody the market is seemingly never-ending.\u0026rdquo; [22]\nThe comparison is not valid, for several reasons.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s think about using Wal-Mart as a \u0026ldquo;physical shelf\u0026rdquo; basis for comparison. It\u0026rsquo;s not a specialist store, and although it sells a lot of music by volume it does so by doing just what it does in other areas \u0026ndash; picks the top sellers and limits its stock to just them. Wal-Mart sells far fewer titles than a specialist CD store, just as it sells fewer book titles than a specialist bookstore and fewer toys than a specialist toy store. But it still drove Toys-R-Us to the brink (at the last time I checked) of bankruptcy. If you look at specialist stores the comparison is not so stark and may even go the other way. For example, HMV in the UK reported in 2004 (PDF file - see page 5) that \u0026ldquo;Whilst the 200 best-selling CD albums account for approximately 56% of the market, these titles in HMV UK are approximately 40% of sales. Similar ratios apply to DVD. So, with approximately 60% of HMV UK’s sales coming from the back-catalogue, the resilience of our model was proven during a year in which it faced the sternest of competitive tests.\u0026rdquo; So the physical world consists of those like Wal-Mart who cherry pick the hits (shortest shelves) followed by the big chain stores like HMV (longer shelves) followed by specialist stores that stock just classical music for example, whose shelves may be short but whose stock complements that of HMV and Wal-Mart. To compare Wal-Mart against Rhapsody is misleading as a portrayal of the physical vs. digital worlds. In fact, numbers from a more recent weblog posting by Anderson shows that Rhapsody makes approximately 48-50% of its sales from the top 200 albums (it shows data for 100 and 1,000 so this is a rough interpolation), compared to HMV\u0026rsquo;s 40%. Rhapsody, by this measure at least (and there are oth er measures), is more hit driven than HMV.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another problem with choosing Wal-Mart as a basis for comparison. Anderson is looking to compare old models against new (remember that \u0026ldquo;preview of 21st-century economics\u0026rdquo; subtitle in the introduction?), but Wal-Mart is just as new as digital technology. Its growth in the US throughout the 1990\u0026rsquo;s parallels that of the Internet. It\u0026rsquo;s no old dinosaur being supplanted by new technology, it is just another face of new technology.\nWe can think of another model for \u0026ldquo;the Future of Business\u0026rdquo;, which you might call the Long Vice, in which specialist retailers like HMV and (even more) its smaller independent brethren are being squeezed from both sides. On one side is Wal-Mart, using its economies of scale to provide the hits and cherry-pick that revenue from the specialist retailer. On the other side is the online retailer who can pick up some of the smaller selling items. Whether this leaves us with more choice or less (or a bit of both) is up for grabs, and we can talk more about the forces that drive down choice in the modern economy later on when Anderson goes into \u0026ldquo;Long Tail Economics\u0026rdquo; in a little more detail. But at least let\u0026rsquo;s acknowledge that the Long Tail story of old physical Wal-Mart vs new digital Rhapsody is fundamentally oversimplified and fails to make Anderson\u0026rsquo;s case.\nAnderson spends most of this section on Rhapsody, and then does similar comparisons in other industries; Borders vs. Amazon, Blockbuster vs. Netflix. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to talk about Borders vs. Amazon here.\nHaving set the stage plausibly (but incorrectly, as we have seen) with the Rhapsody story, it seems to be just confirming evidence for the Long Tail hypothesis when he says that Amazon makes 25% of its business from books \u0026ldquo;not available in offline retail stores\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;products you can\u0026rsquo;t find anywhere but online\u0026rdquo; [23 - diagram]. But there are two problems. First is that misleading phrasing. We have three new-book bookstores in my town. Chapters sells more books, but Words Worth (our independent book store) sells an overlapping set, and A Mysterious Affair sells a different set too (and then there are Christian book stores and probably other ones I don\u0026rsquo;t know of). So our total number of books \u0026ldquo;available in offline retail stores\u0026rdquo; is much bigger than the stock of Chapters. Phrasing the comparison between Borders and Amazon as a comparison between \u0026ldquo;the offline world\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the online world\u0026rdquo; is misleading, just as the Wal-Mart vs Rhapsody comparison was misleading. This is especially so because (again, we\u0026rsquo;ll come to this) there are reasons for thinking that while the physical world is populated by a variety of stores - even though some smaller ones are being threatened by the Wal-Mart/Borders model and (ironically) by Amazon and Netflix \u0026ndash; the online world has forces that encourage natural monopolies (quick, name a pure-play new-book online retailer that isn\u0026rsquo;t Amazon) or at least oligopolies. At the beginning of this post I hypothesized about the role of small out-of-the-way stores in the revitalization of Hush Puppies. It is possible that the new world may have less variety in it than the old.\nThe second problem with the story has been pointed out elsewhere and discussed (with honesty, I should add) by Anderson here. He says that \u0026ldquo;One of the most quoted statistics in my original article was the data point that 57% of Amazon’s book sales are in the Long Tail, defined as beyond the 100,000 books available in the typical Barnes and Noble superstore\u0026rdquo;. Well, that estimate came from an analysis of Amazon\u0026rsquo;s proprietary data (it does not publish detailed breakdowns of its sales). A revised estimate, included without comment in the book, is that the Long Tail accounts for 25% of sales. This is a downward revision of over half, and yet it has not affected Anderson\u0026rsquo;s thesis or his winning enthusiasm for it at all. You have to wonder about a hypothesis that is so little affected by a big change in its underlying data from the real world.\nThe chapter finishes, as so many of them do in this book, with a ringing call towards a bright future. \u0026ldquo;as demand shifts towards the niches, the economics of providing them improve further, and so on, creating a positive feedback loop that will transform entire industries \u0026ndash; and the culture \u0026ndash; for decades to come\u0026rdquo; [26]. At this stage of the book, we just have to say that the jury is out, but if you are like me, you\u0026rsquo;ll be feeling increasingly suspicious and frustrated by the slippery way in which Anderson is putting together facts, stories, and comparisons to create a misleading picture that, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know, supports Anderson\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis. There are forces pushing towards an increased reliance on hits (see Wal-Mart above) as well as pushing out the other way. Some people say that online stores are just as hit-driven as bricks-and-mortar. The burden of proof is on Anderson, especially given the evangelical language he uses to describe what he is talking about. And in this chapter he dramatically fails to make his case.\n","date":1171832242,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"46b1ea4b9f8289d968c1ab9af9a399e1","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/chapter_1_start/","publishdate":"2007-02-18T20:57:22Z","relpermalink":"/post/chapter_1_start/","section":"post","summary":"This is part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and discusses \u0026ldquo;Chapter 1 - The Long Tail\u0026rdquo;.

Part 0 is here. The previous part in this series is here.\nAfter taking two posts to get past the cover, you may be very glad to know I have nothing to say about the dedication page or the acknowledgments. This exercise will be long-winded enough without that. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m ploughing on, turning pages recklessly past the Table of Contents and all the way to the Introduction. But I\u0026rsquo;ll stop there, and look at it closely.\nThe point of an Introduction is pretty similar to the cover. It\u0026rsquo;s to set out the main themes of the book, to sketch the argument, and so to draw the reader in. Some writers call it Chapter 1 (that\u0026rsquo;s what I did) and others don\u0026rsquo;t call it a chapter (that\u0026rsquo;s what Anderson does), including it as part of the front matter for the book.\nUnsurprisingly then, some of the things I have to say here will repeat what I said about the cover. Anderson starts off by talking about the world we are in now, and this world is \u0026ldquo;the world the blockbuster built\u0026rdquo; [1]. (Remember, numbers in square brackets are page numbers in the book, not footnotes) But that world is \u0026ldquo;starting to tatter at the edges\u0026rdquo; [2].\nI want to spend some time on a paragraph on page 2 where he backs up this claim that blockbusters have had their day. It\u0026rsquo;s not the only place he does this, and we\u0026rsquo;ll return to the question of whether blockbusters are \u0026ldquo;starting to, gasp, rule less\u0026rdquo; later, but this is the first time he attempts to bolster the claim. He writes that \u0026ldquo;Most of the top-fifty selling albums of all time were recorded in the seventies and eighties\u0026rdquo; [2]. (The end notes make it clear he is talking about the USA here. As elsewhere, most of his figures and data refer to the US.) Interesting, but what about other areas of culture? A parallel statement would be that most of the top-grossing movies of all time were in the same time period. But the top grossing film of all time is Titanic (1997) and even adjusted for inflation, the top box office hits are Gone With the Wind, Star Wars, The Sound of Music, ET, The Ten Commandments, and Titanic - one each from the thirties, fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, and nineties. Among the top 50 are 2 from the 1930\u0026rsquo;s, 4 from the 1940\u0026rsquo;s, 5 from the 1950\u0026rsquo;s, 9 from the 1960\u0026rsquo;s, 11 from the 1970\u0026rsquo;s, 7 from the 1980\u0026rsquo;s, 7 from the 1990\u0026rsquo;s, and 4 so far from the 2000\u0026rsquo;s. So there is perhaps a bit of a peak here, but it is not a dramatic one, especially as the figures are biased towards pre-1980 films which have had multiple releases (Disney animations in particular). So movies do not seem to show the same waning blockbuster effect as music. Instead, Anderson points to the waning total theatergoing audience, which seems to me a different phenomenon entirely.\nOn TV he has a stronger case - the waning of network TV in the US means that \u0026ldquo;the number one show today wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have made the top ten in 1970\u0026rdquo;. But what about books, the other area of entertainment/culture that he talks about a lot? He doesn\u0026rsquo;t say. The bestselling books of all time are books such as the Bible and Quotations from Chairman Mao, which don\u0026rsquo;t tell us a lot about book-buying habits in the sense he is looking for. A best-selling book can sell for years, decades, or more, giving Beatrix Potter\u0026rsquo;s Peter Rabbit a head start over Asterix. So although I do feel sceptical about the fall-off of blockbuster books (Da Vinci Code and Harry Potter anyone?) I\u0026rsquo;ll give him a break here.\nReturning to movies for a moment, there are other sides of the movie industry which tell a different story from the one that Anderson is telling. Peter Grant and Chris Wood\u0026rsquo;s 2004 book Blockbusters and Trade Wars explains how (p 76) the era of the blockbuster started with Jaws. Before then, most movies launched in a \u0026ldquo;rolling opening\u0026rdquo; screening in major cities first and smaller centres later. Jaws opened on 460 screens - a big change. By 1995 however, \u0026ldquo;virtually all of the 150 or so movies released by major studios in the United States and Canada opened in more than 800 screens. By the turn of the century, 2,000- to 3,000-screen openings were commonplace. In 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u0026rsquo;s Stone opened in the United States on a breathtaking 8,200 screens \u0026ndash; nearly a quarter of all the theatres in America. On its opening weekend in Canada that year, Goldmember managed to seat an even more astonishing 52 per cent of all admissions\u0026rdquo;. Here is a different story - if blockbusters are waning, it is not because we have more choice but because they are living a shorter time, rolling over ever more urgently to make way for the next big opening. Anderson skips over these other consequences of the increasing returns to scale of digital production.\nAnderson\u0026rsquo;s conclusion, then, is that hits \u0026ldquo;are not quite the economic force they used to be\u0026rdquo;. More dramatically, he goes on to say \u0026ldquo;Where are those fickle consumers going instead? No single place. They are scattered to the winds as markets fragment into countless niches.\u0026rdquo; At this stage in the book, the reader can only say \u0026ldquo;well, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u0026rdquo; He hasn\u0026rsquo;t proven his case yet, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure.\niTunes Killed the Radio Star [2-6] contrasts Anderson\u0026rsquo;s own upbringing in the \u0026lsquo;70s and \u0026lsquo;80s with a modern teenager. The difference is simple: \u0026ldquo;The main difference between Ben\u0026rsquo;s adolecence and my own is simply choice. I was limited to what was broadcast over the airwaves. He\u0026rsquo;s got the Internet.\u0026rdquo; Now let\u0026rsquo;s be clear: the Internet is a big thing. It is changing much about this world, including adolescent lives. It\u0026rsquo;s going to change more. Some of the changes will be profound, some banal, some specialist, some pervasive - and it\u0026rsquo;s only just starting. It is the multifaceted nature of the changes it is bringing that make comparisons dangerous. When Anderson says \u0026ldquo;He plays video games with friends, mostly online\u0026rdquo; he is confirming that one change is that play has shifted from the streets, from friends homes, to the computer screen and networks. So to compare Broadcast TV to \u0026ldquo;The Internet\u0026rdquo; is misleading. This is something I\u0026rsquo;ll return to in later chapters, but what he is describing is not so much an increase in choice as a shift in choices. Some choices (playing in the street) have basically been lost, while others have risen to take their place. Just because these new options travel over the same network as online newspapers does not change the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s just another form of playing with friends.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, Anderson\u0026rsquo;s description of his mass culture youth, hemmed in by the small number of rock stations, and by an inability to explore outside the mainstream, is just not plausible. I mean, I was there. I grew up in the \u0026lsquo;70s on the edge of Leeds, a middle-sized provincial city in the UK, and went to school in a town of 13,000 people. This was not a cutting edge environment, but even within that I was behind the times - unfashionable, with a narrow taste in music and a conformist taste in clothes. But even I managed, despite my best efforts, to be exposed to non-mainstream culture. The biggest band of the mid-\u0026lsquo;70s was Led Zeppelin, who thrived despite never being played on radio. My own particular favourite was Pink Floyd (ditto) but there were minor bands a plenty (Wishbone Ash anyone? Hawkwind?) My friend Matthew was into German techno-rock: Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk. And that was before punk shook everyone up. So to portray this world as devoid of anything but the mainstream is, frankly, ridiculous.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s leave my teenage years behind quickly and go back to the book. A section called \u0026ldquo;The 98 Percent Rule\u0026rdquo; [6-10] describes the beginnings of the book. The rule is based on a conversation he had with the CEO of Ecast, a digital jukebox company. This CEO pointed o ut that 98% of all their 10,000 albums had sold at least one track per quarter (three-month period). Anderson is stunned at the variety of people\u0026rsquo;s tastes when unencumbered by the physical limitations of old jukeboxes. This 98 percent rule is that just about anything you can offer for sale will find a buyer, so if you can (in a digital world) offer everything, then you can make money off all those items that sell a few here and there. Hits still matter, but \u0026ldquo;What if the non-hits\u0026ndash;from healthy niche products to outright misses\u0026ndash;all together added up to a market as big as, if not bigger than, the hits themselves?\u0026rdquo; [8].\nOne reviewer who has challenged this part of the book is Wall Street Journal\u0026rsquo;s Lee Gomes. Gomes argues (here ) that whereas Anderson claims the 98% rule to be \u0026ldquo;nearly universal\u0026rdquo; citing iTunes, Netflix, Amazon and others (\u0026ldquo;And so it went, from company to company\u0026rdquo;), Gomes himself found something different:\nBut when I looked online, I was surprised to see what seemed like the opposite. Ecast says 10% of its songs account for roughly 90% of its streams; monthly data from Rhapsody showed the top 10% songs getting 86% of streams.     Bloglines, the widely used blog-reading tool, lists 1.2 million blogs; real ones, not computer-generated \"spam blogs.\" The top 10% of feeds grab 88% of all subscriptions. And 35% have no current subscribers at all -- there's clearly no 98 Percent Rule in the blogosphere.   At Apple's iTunes, one person who has seen the data -- which Apple doesn't disclose -- said sales \"closely track Billboard. It's a hits business. The data tend to refute 'The Long Tail.' \"   Other economists, of course, are looking into these same questions, though some seem to be reaching far more restrained conclusions. Harvard's Anita Elberse, whom Mr. Anderson said was a consultant during his two-year research project, studies the video sales market, both online and off.   She said in an email that her work to date shows a \"slight shift\" toward the tail. But she also noted \"a rapidly increasing number of titles that never, or very rarely, sell,\" which suggests \"it is difficult for content providers to profit from the 'tail.' \"   It would be wonderful if the world as Mr. Anderson describes it were true: one where \"healthy niche products\" and even \"outright misses\" collectively could stand their ground with the culture's increasingly soulless \"hits.\"   But while every singer-songwriter dreams from his bedroom of making a living off iTunes, few actually do, mostly because so many others have the very same idea. And to the extent that Apple is making money off iTunes, thanks go to Nelly Furtado and other hitmakers. Indeed, you can make the case that the Internet is amplifying the role of hits, even in relation to misses, not diminishing them.    Anderson responds on his weblog but while there is dispute over other portions of the book (and we\u0026rsquo;ll get to those in a few posts time) he doesn\u0026rsquo;t challenge this part so far. The 98 percent rule seems to be a rule that is often broken.\nAnderson himself replaced the phrasing of \u0026ldquo;98 percent rule\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail\u0026rdquo; as he continued his work. The point to make here is that in the introduction, despite some intriguing-sounding stories and some big claims, he has not demonstrated that a \u0026ldquo;Long Tail effect\u0026rdquo; actually exists. This matters.\nTails Everywhere [10-11] is one of two places where the book goes seriously off the rails. As we\u0026rsquo;ll see, for most of the book the meaning of \u0026ldquo;The Long Tail\u0026rdquo; is fairly clear, but every now and then Anderson seems to get carried away and treat it as just another word for \u0026ldquo;variety\u0026rdquo;. So here he says \u0026ldquo;People often ask me to name some product category that does not lend itself to Long Tail economics. My usual answer is that it would be in some undifferentiated commodity, where variety is not only absent but unwanted. Like for instance, flour\u0026hellip; Then I happened to step inside our local Whole Foods grocery and realized how wrong I was: Today the grocery carries more than twenty different types of flour\u0026hellip; There is, amazingly enough, already a Long Tail in flour.\u0026rdquo; [11] This passage has two large faults. First, it clearly implies that Anderson sees the logic of the Long Tail, most of which is about media and entertainment industries, as extending to pretty much all of economics \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;The Future of Business\u0026rdquo;. Also, he sees it as stretching beyond the digital world. Yet here (and again we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this when he explains in more detail what he means by a Long Tail effect) he seems to be saying that the mere presence of a variety of goods is sufficient to indicate a change. You have to wonder, does 37 brands of toothpaste reflect a long tail in toothpaste? And what if (something he doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention) they all come from two companies? If he is going to argue that Long Tail simply means the emergence of niche markets then he has to demonstrate that a change is happening, whereby niche markets are becoming more important. Once more, at least in his introduction, he does not do this.\nA Preview Of Twenty-First-Century Economics [11-13] sets out how Anderson sees his book. First, he sees it as an economics research project (among other things). He\u0026rsquo;s doing economic research that \u0026ldquo;very few economists\u0026rdquo; [12] are doing, and venturing into \u0026ldquo;uncharted waters\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Some of the data in this book\u0026rdquo; he says \u0026ldquo;has never before seen the light of day\u0026rdquo;. Anderson claims his role is to \u0026ldquo;synthesize the results [of the efforts of online entrepreneurs] into a framework. That is, of course, what economics does: It seeks to find neat, easily understood frameworks that describe real-world phenomena\u0026rdquo;. So this is an economics research book, he says.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s sum up what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the introduction. It has some nice sentences, some big claims, but is already showing at least three potential problems. First, he is so far unable to substantiate his claim that the era of blockbusters is waning and that the \u0026ldquo;mass-culture era\u0026rdquo; [2] of the \u0026lsquo;70s and \u0026lsquo;80s has given way to a world of niche cultures. Second, his 98 percent rule seems dubious. Third, he is claiming to have a book of research that sets the stage for the future of business and twenty-first century economics \u0026ndash; he is setting the bar high. Can he clear it? Let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026hellip;\n","date":1171794013,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"cc2ebe44eacadafbd47c144ddde302e3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/youll_be_very_g/","publishdate":"2007-02-18T10:20:13Z","relpermalink":"/post/youll_be_very_g/","section":"post","summary":"This is part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and discusses the Introduction.

Part 0 is here.\nI know, I know. Never judge a book by its cover. But books sell themselves based on their cover, even in the digital world, so covers matter. The cover is the author\u0026rsquo;s chance, and the publisher\u0026rsquo;s chance, to tell us in a few words and images what this book is all about before we put down our dollars or euros and buy it. At some point we all judge books by their cover: what does The Long Tail\u0026rsquo;s cover tell us to expect in this book?\nAt the top of the cover on the edition I have (probably the Canadian edition) is the phrase \u0026ldquo;The New Economics of Culture\u0026rdquo;. On some other editions, like the one shown above, the phrase is \u0026ldquo;How Endless Choice is Creating Unlimited Demand\u0026rdquo;. Either way the message is clear, and it sets the tone. New Economics of Culture, Unlimited Demand, Endless Choice: these are grand phrases proclaiming big ideas about dramatic change.\nThe title comes next, and a good title it is. The Long Tail. Even if you haven\u0026rsquo;t read the book, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance you\u0026rsquo;ve heard that phrase, because it has become a catch phrase for many different developments in the digital economy. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite up there with The Tipping Point, but it\u0026rsquo;s close. Getting a good title is an important thing. To summarize an argument in a pithy, evocative phrase is not just smart, it\u0026rsquo;s good communication and good communication is what books are all about. Chris Anderson used the title first a few years before the book, in an article in Wired Magazine, of which he is the editor. I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to that, because although the article forms the basis for the argument of the book, and much of the article forms chapter 1 of the book, an article and a book are two different things. Still, this is a promising start.\nBelow the title is a simple graphic. It\u0026rsquo;s an Enter button from a computer keyboard, which both welcomes us to the book and tells us that this is a book about the digital world.\nAnd then the subtitle: \u0026ldquo;Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More\u0026rdquo;. Again, this is a big statement and I\u0026rsquo;m going to hold Anderson to it. He\u0026rsquo;s talking about the Future of Business. It\u0026rsquo;s a big subject. He\u0026rsquo;s not talking about the future of 15% of business, or the future of some companies in San Francisco, he\u0026rsquo;s talking about the Future of Business and he\u0026rsquo;s telling us what it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, which is Selling Less of More. Diversification, the end of the blockbuster, the promise of variety and choice, the dream of a more democratic, participatory, and diverse future: these are the visions that the phrase conjures up.\nAt the bottom of the page is a blurb by Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google no less. \u0026ldquo;Anderson\u0026rsquo;s insights influence Google\u0026rsquo;s strategic thinking in a profound way. READ THIS BRILLIANT AND TIMELY BOOK\u0026rdquo;. Coming from the chief of one of the quintessential new Silicon Valley companies, this is high praise. The blurbs on the back cover continue the tone. They come from other CEO\u0026rsquo;s - Reed Hastings of Netflix, Rob Glaser of RealNetworks, Terry Semel of Yahoo! - as well as other prominent commentators: James Surowiecki of the New Yorker Magazine, Lawrence Lessig of Stanford Law School and Geoffrey Moore, business author and founder of the Chasm Group. These are visible, prominent people.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see where the endorsers come from in the light of Anderson\u0026rsquo;s claim in the book that the new economy eliminates \u0026ldquo;The Tyranny of Locality\u0026rdquo; [p17] or \u0026ldquo;The Tyranny of Geography\u0026rdquo; [162] or \u0026ldquo;the tyranny of physical space\u0026rdquo; [163]. There are eight people on the cover (including Anderson himself). Here is where they come from (look for the red dots):\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one dot in New York (that\u0026rsquo;s James Surowiecki) and one in Seattle (Rob Glaser of RealNetworks). The other six are grouped together, indistinguishably at this scale, in and around San Francisco. Here\u0026rsquo;s a close-up of the San Francisco Bay area with the six red dots marked:\nSo looking at the cover does tell us something. It tells us that this is a Silicon Valley book, written by someone who (as editor of Wired Magazine) is well connected with the movers and shakers of the digital world. Not only does he influence them (as Schmidt says) but he listens to them. He knows them and they know him.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an obvious irony here. A book about how the digital world permits small players from the fringes to reach a bigger audience (in ways I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss later) and about how geography is fading as a force in our world comes to us from the centre of that new world, praised by big names from the high-class-neighbourhood of the techno-culture. It is promoted by and emerging from a network of culturally similar, geographically close (and very wealthy) people: The Long Tail is a reflection of conversations among a new elite. The Long Tail is joined to a head, and the head is still very much the place to be.\nIn his blurb, the CEO of Yahoo! says that \u0026ldquo;Technology and the Internet are making the world a smaller and more connected place.\u0026rdquo; Moore argues that the new economy will have \u0026ldquo;more collaborative, participative, and idiosyncratic offerings\u0026hellip; knocking the Old Guard on its backside in the process\u0026rdquo;. Glaser says it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;the biggest transformation of media since the commercialization of television fifty years ago\u0026rdquo;. The cover tells us that perhaps this quirky and diverse new world may have aspects to it that are not entirely unlike the old one. Is that simply an irony, or is it a marker of a problem with the book? I\u0026rsquo;ll argue in what follows that it is a symptom of some things that are wrong with the book itself.\nThe inside flap continues the extravagant praise for the book. It is compared to The Tipping Point twice. The Long Tail is \u0026ldquo;an entirely new model for business that is just starting to show its power\u0026rdquo;. And it\u0026rsquo;s not just the digital world that will be changed: \u0026ldquo;a similar transformation is coming to just about every industry imaginable.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What happens when everything in the world is available to everyone?\u0026rdquo; This is setting the bar pretty high for the actual content. Next time, let\u0026rsquo;s finally get to the book itself.\n","date":1171742167,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1f6b4b8d3bafa622f2ebdb80ead2f888","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/i_know_i_know_n/","publishdate":"2007-02-17T19:56:07Z","relpermalink":"/post/i_know_i_know_n/","section":"post","summary":"This is part of my critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion to The Long Tail and it discusses the cover.

And if you\u0026rsquo;re going to read these postings, there are some things you should know - and that\u0026rsquo;s what this introductory post is for, to make sure all my cards are on the table.\nThe posts talk about The Long Tail, but they are really about two books. Both were published in summer 2006 and both were about the changing face of individual choice in today\u0026rsquo;s economy and culture. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for The Long Tail\u0026rsquo;s index being two pages shorter, both would be exactly 240 pages long. Both authors have a training in science, but neither are professional economists or cultural studies professionals. In fact, both work in the computer industry, one as an editor of Wired Magazine, and one for a computer software company. At the time of writing, The Long Tail is at number 310 in the Amazon best seller list. The other book currently stands at 806,127.\nObviously that second author is me. My book is \u0026ldquo;No One Makes You Shop At Wal-Mart: the surprising deceptions of individual choice\u0026rdquo; and it was published by Between The Lines of Toronto, a small publisher whose staff love books and love to publish provocative, left-wing titles with an academic slant. The Long Tail is published by Hyperion, of New York. As for the subject and the authors\u0026rsquo; take on it, mine is encapsulated in that phrase \u0026ldquo;the surprising deceptions of individual choice\u0026rdquo; and Anderson\u0026rsquo;s in a chapter title \u0026ldquo;The Paradise of Choice\u0026rdquo;. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more opposite.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s a danger here, because I have a chip on my shoulder. The Long Tail and No One Makes You\u0026hellip; cover overlapping territory, and have almost diametrically opposite views. I think that Anderson is basically wrong. Not completely wrong, but basically wrong. What\u0026rsquo;s more, and what\u0026rsquo;s more important, I think his book is fundamentally sloppy and misleading despite the fact that there are a few good insights - and he does have a great title. But you, dear reader, knowing that I have the aforementioned chip on my shoulder, might naturally and understandably think this is sour grapes - the envious grumblings of a bit player when a more talented writer has seized the agenda and won the argument.\nAnd maybe it is. I\u0026rsquo;d like to say not, but who am I to say? Any honest person knows that we are not the best judge of our own motivations. I\u0026rsquo;m sure as hell not the best judge of mine, and that\u0026rsquo;s why I wanted to get this off my chest before starting. If you see bias in what I say, you know where it comes from.\nBut even with that danger of misdirected envy, there are still things I want to say, so all I can do is put down what I think and you can judge it on its merits. One option would be to take a five paragraph run at the book, but its success and its influence have been so significant that it needs more. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a chapter-by-chapter run at the thing (with a couple of extra posts as well).\nJust a few more preparatory statements before we can start.\nFirst, this is a reading of the book, which is a bit different from the idea behind the book. There are only a few cases where I have gone beyond what is in the book to cite discussion and research that has happened since its publication (or before). A book should stand reasonably well on its own, or point to places for more reading if it leaves discussions open-ended.\nSecond, there are some things that are important to me in non-fiction books. Consistency is important. So is clarity. And so is logic. If they don\u0026rsquo;t matter to you - if rhetoric or eloquent phrasing or memorable stories matter more, then you and I are going to have different opinions.\nThird, I reference page numbers in the book in square brackets, like [23] this.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s all. The next post takes a look at the cover (this project may take a while to complete).\n","date":1171740754,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"fb48397af784b4e61cfc5be9f980dc5b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/my_next_several/","publishdate":"2007-02-17T19:32:34Z","relpermalink":"/post/my_next_several/","section":"post","summary":"My next several postings are going to be a critical reader\u0026rsquo;s companion for The Long Tail by Chris Anderson.

It\u0026rsquo;s odd whose death gets noticed and whose doesn\u0026rsquo;t: Jane Jacobs\u0026rsquo; passing was remarked far and wide (and rightly so) but Rapoport, who I think was as important a thinker in a different way, seemed to get less attention. Their posts helped to right that a little in the social science blogosphere.\nComments on Brad DeLong\u0026rsquo;s posting pulled him into a sequence of posts about Tit for Tat and other repeated prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma strategies, in A Note on a GRIM Game of Repeated Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma\u0026hellip;., and More on Tit for Tat. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to put my two cents in here.\nFirst, I do agree with one commenter (David Cameron) that the submission of Tit for Tat, although widely known because of Axelrod\u0026rsquo;s writing about the tournaments, was certainly not the most substantial of Rapoport\u0026rsquo;s contributions. Still, it has a certain je ne sais quoi that obviously catches the attention, as all the discussion at BDL\u0026rsquo;s site makes clear.\nThe fact that Rapoport submitted (twice) and won with Tit for Tat was a reflection of what he had learned pragmatically in his experiments in playing repeated prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma (on a petty side note, I can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to use Axelrod\u0026rsquo;s term \u0026ldquo;iterated prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma\u0026rdquo; which seems slightly pretentious and also inaccurate). The observation that T4T is not a subgame-perfect equilibrium for the game is beside the point in some ways - the tournament was just that, and the strategy won.\nBut of course there is more to it than the tournaments, because of the pedagogical use Axelrod made of them and of Tit for Tat as a way of looking at many disparate problems. There seem to be two arguments against Axelrod\u0026rsquo;s book.\nThe first is that strategies similar to T4T but slightly different can be discovered that do better under a wider class of situations. This does not seem too important. The repeated Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma is, after all, never an exact match to any real world situation (and the real world is surely what we are interested in), so a theoretically more rigorous (or, in this case, computationally better) solution for the game is not guaranteed to perform better in the real world - where what constitutes a \u0026ldquo;move\u0026rdquo; is never precisely clear, and the game is never as self-contained as the idealized game that game theory studies. Axelrod accepts this, and so goes happily into all kinds of areas which are sometimes little more than reminiscent of his tournament. Even in the modelling work he discusses there are many variants - spatial games where neighbours are fixed, for example. So the key insights here are that (a) reciprocity as an approach can be successful in a wide variety of situations, (b) T4T catches the essence of reciprocity in a compact form, and \u0026copy; the success of reciprocity is surprising. So I\u0026rsquo;m with Axelrod on this.\nThe second critique is that strategies completely unlike T4T may do better, and in particular a strategy such as \u0026ldquo;GRIM\u0026rdquo;, which defects for ever on first losing. One of the comments points out that Grim is a subgame perfect equilibrium for the infinitely repeated PD. The idea of a \u0026ldquo;successful strategy\u0026rdquo; in an infinitely repeated game is fickle (it depends, for example, on the other strategies allowed, of which there are infinitely many) and it is not clear to me that subgame perfect equilibrium is the best criterion, but this is nevertheless a valuable reminder that reciprocity is not always the outcome of repeated interactions - sometimes the outcome is much less happy. And that\u0026rsquo;s OK. It is probably true that Axelrod overstates the case in his enthusiasm for T4T, but T4T does show that a grim outcome is far from inevitable, which in the real world is plenty to be going on with.\nHow rigorous we need to be in treatments of formal, idealized problems to learn practical lessons for messy real world situations is itself a messy real-world problem, and those mathematically inclined who argue that a fully rigorous treatment of a problem is the only basis for such lessons are wrong. So I give Axelrod a lot of credit here. His book, after all, prompted many many fruitful questions - and that is, perhaps more than precise answers, the mark of important ideas.\n","date":1170720509,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1f487da65aab38b1a2c7ff3abe438bb2","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/tit_fot_tat/","publishdate":"2007-02-06T00:08:29Z","relpermalink":"/post/tit_fot_tat/","section":"post","summary":"First, my thanks to Mark Thoma, John Quiggin, and Brad DeLong for responding to my request to mark the passing of Anatol Rapoport.

There is more in the Globe and Mail obituary.\n His book \u0026ldquo;Strategy and Conscience\u0026rdquo; was a unique contribution to the struggle against militaristic thinking in the cold war. It responded to the technicians of the Rand Corporation and others whose supposedly rational thinking was helping to guide strategy. Rapoport\u0026rsquo;s response to them was unique. He took them on at their own game, so to speak, and showed how the game theory approach missed key aspects of the conflict. He was not \u0026ldquo;anti game theory\u0026rdquo; by any means \u0026ndash; quite the opposite \u0026ndash; but also knew the limits of theory and the dangers of elegant but ultimately simplistic thinking.\n As game theory developed in the \u0026lsquo;50s and \u0026lsquo;60s Rapoport was one of those who investigated the interface between the formal side of game theory and a recognition that people behave in a rich psychological manner. This form of experimentation has continued and expanded right through to the present day.\n I read some of his 1984 book \u0026ldquo;Mathematical Methods in the Social and Behavioral Sciences\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s a great book. There are not many people who have a strong and original mathematical mind and yet know how to apply it with wisdom, but Rapoport\u0026rsquo;s reach and depth in the book is hugely impressive.\n In addition to this intellectual strength, Rapoport was one of the leading figures in Peace Studies in this country. It\u0026rsquo;s taken a long effort from many people to make the obvious point that war is a complex and important problem, and if we are to understand how to achieve peaceful outcomes then no one discipline is enough. We need to bring the insights of as many disciplines as possible to bear on one of the most important problems of our times. There is a need for a strong intellectual effort to accompany other efforts in the search for peace, and Peace Studies is where that comes from.\n  I know two people who have known Rapoport at different times. Both were very impressed by him personally. He was obviously a cultured, somewhat intimidating, productive and original thinker and person. I wish I\u0026rsquo;d met him.\nIn the acknowledgement at the beginning of \u0026ldquo;No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart\u0026rdquo; I listed several people whose intellectual debt is obvious throughout the book. In the 10 months since it was published two of those have died (Jane Jacobs and Anatol Rapoport). The world is worse off without them.\nOne final note. In looking for more information about Rapoport I came across a quotation from Daniel Dennett (another of my favourite writers) who wrote this:\nThe social psychologist and game theorist Anatol Rapoport (creator of the winning Tit-for-Tat strategy in Robert Axelrod’s legendary prisoner’s dilemma tournament) once promulgated a list of rules for how to write a successful critical commentary on an opponent’s work. First, he said, you must attempt to re-express your opponent’s position so clearly, vividly and fairly that your opponent says “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.” Then, you should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement), and third, you should mention anything you have learned from your opponent. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.    Challenging words.\n","date":1170530997,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"0c812655e61667987c3d97094af77c82","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/in_memoriam_ana/","publishdate":"2007-02-03T19:29:57Z","relpermalink":"/post/in_memoriam_ana/","section":"post","summary":"I saw in the Globe and Mail that Anatol Rapoport died in Toronto on January 20, at the age of, I think, 95.

Well that's exactly how your boss will want it from now on, according to new research from Canada.     Psychologists from the University of Alberta found miserable people make better workers than happy ones.     Cheerful people waste too much time trying to maintain their happy mood, while their dour co-workers simply get on with the task in hand, the project found.     The findings put a question mark over the millions spent each year on ensuring a happy working environment.     Comedians     Some companies even hire comedians to keep their employees smiling.     But if the Canadian research is right, they are wasting their money.     Grumpy, of Disney's The Seven Dwarves Grumpy: rarely whistled while he worked The researchers, led by psychologists Robert Sinclair and Carrie Lavis, studied four groups of workers building circuit boards on a production line.     Although those who described their mood as 'sad' did not produce any more work, they made half as many mistakes as happy workers - so fewer of their products failed quality control tests.     The study also found miserable people used work to distract themselves from their mood.     While happy people were more likely to regard work as an unwanted distraction - and a source of unhappiness.     The findings fly in the face of previous research on the subject, which suggests happy workers are more productive.     If it catches on, it could also spell the end for bonding weekends, company songs and other attempts at corporate jollity - something that could put a smile on the face of the most stony-faced employee.

Jennifer Wells in the Toronto Star interviews Jing Zhou, of Rice University. Wells\u0026rsquo; article When negative thinking is job 1 is about the paper \u0026ldquo;When job dissatisfaction leads to creativity: Encouraging the expression of voice\u0026rdquo;.\n**M**onday, Monday. Can't trust that day. You know what we're talking about. The work week commences and finds you in a bad mood. Attitude? Negative.   Well here's something to buoy dyspeptic workers. According to Jing Zhou – a professor of management at Rice University in Houston and co-author of a new research paper on job dissatisfaction – grumpy employees can be forces of good within an organization.   That perpetually peppy co-worker of yours? Vastly over-rated.     **Let's begin with the long-held assumption that a high level of job satisfaction contributes positively to organizational effectiveness. You call that an \"intuitively appealing link.\" Has there been no empirical research to support this assumption?**     People in our field, when you see things like this, you do something called a meta analysis... Taken as a whole, 100-something studies. What do they tell us? What's the general conclusion? That's why we say when we look at a meta analysis result... the relation between job satisfaction and effectiveness is not there.     **Yet the image of the happy, smiling employee persists as the standard for good employee behaviour does it not?**     A lot of those things are our perceptions and are not supported by the data. Lots of times when people are really happy, co-operative, things like that, I think they would be very beneficial for a company if the company wants people to do exactly what they are told. You know, the routine kind of tasks... But tasks are complex in today's competitive environment, so they need to be able to think.     **You sampled 149 employees and found something quite surprising: those with high job dissatisfaction exhibited the highest creativity. How do you explain that****?**     This is so unconventional, it was scary to begin with because you know we thought we are kind of arguing against the majority. But if you look at the whole thing it makes sense, because these are the employees whose job was not research and development. So they go to work not thinking \"I'm going to be creative today.\" They only become creative when they're dissatisfied with something and try to find a solution to it.     **So the bad-mood employee can work as a change agent, in a positive way, within a corporation**.     Exactly, because they see problems, whereas those who are very happy and content, the people who are always, you ask them, \"Are you satisfied with your job?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you satisfied with your work environment?\" \"Yes. I'm happy with everything. I don't see problems.\" Therefore they don't try to find new ideas to solve problems.     **So it is the miserable employee who may have come up with new and better ways of doing things**.     We want to be a bit careful with the \"miserable.\" I know it's exciting to use those extreme words. When we say \"bad mood,\" this is within the typical normal range of peoples' negative emotion. We're not suggesting that those are clinically depressed people... We're suggesting the source, the source that triggers the bad mood, is probably that people were not happy with how things are run in the workplace. So if companies are sensitive to that and capture that negative energy early they probably can channel that into... an effort to find a good idea, a new idea to solve problems.     **I'm sensing management resistance to this idea**.     Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Absolutely... A lot of managers who are leaders act on conventional wisdom, not on what is right.     **You are not, in fact , suggesting that bad moods _necessarily_ lead to creativity in the workplace**.     No that's not what we're suggesting.     **Under which conditions can job dissatisfaction lead to positive outcomes****?**     If you have a culture that supports innovation, if you have a supervisor or co-worker who provides developmental feedback, to focus the person who's in a bad mood, focus the person's attention to discovering problems, improving things. That would help. From the person's perspective... lots of people when they're not happy they just get up and leave. The person would need to feel somehow that it's hard to leave. We call that continuous commitment. Somehow it's hard to leave and you're almost forced to try to make things better.     **I was particularly struck by this sentence in your paper: \"When employees respond to job dissatisfaction with loyalty, they are, in essence, burying their heads in the sand and carrying on as if everything were fine despite their discontentment.\" Can you expand on that?**     If they are loyal blindly... If they already see a problem but for whatever reason they feel to be loyal is to pretend there's nothing wrong. That would be horrible for the organization... Managers who don't want to hear different opinions will reward yes men and yes women in the workplace. So some employees have learned not to rock the boat, not to say anything that the leaders don't want to hear, even when they see problems. In that kind of culture and environment, they won't be creative. They'll just pretend nothing is happening.     **So an active response to the unhappiness is needed on the part of the employee as opposed to passivity, or quitting. You encourage the \"expression of voice.\" What do you mean by that?**     By voice we mean... they need to be able to speak up. Something is not right here. The way we're doing things is no longer effective. Let's find a new and better way of doing it.     **What can organizations do to encourage this untapped creativity****?**     First of all they need to have a new mindset. This is what we're trying to do in this stream of research. To realize that creativity is not just a job for R and D people. It's a job for everyone... Once the top management has this mindset, then they can do things we're suggesting in our research, such as encouraging people to provide feedback, provide a culture that will support innovation and provide the climate where people... try to make a change for the better.     **Companies have a knack for placing non-risk-taking, non-creative types in management positions**.     Exactly.     **What then must be done****?**     Well, either they do something now or be forced to do something by the external environment. You know what I mean. If they cannot make a change on their own terms, the competition will force them to... So they need to either go through training or somehow change the way leaders are developed and promoted to find and promote and select leaders who do have this healthy dose of risk-taking mindset.     **I feel it's time to tell my manager to embrace my sour moods. Is there a particular strategy you would recommend****?**     First of all, this research is about changing the conventional wisdom. So they need to be aware this is based on scientific research. They need to know this data comes from very vigorous research. Second, I think today's managers are so busy, running the processes of meetings and stuff like that, they lose the personal touch. I say, how about an informal conversation? How about taking someone to lunch? Why can't a manager engage in those personal touches?     **Perhaps I could simply pass along a copy of your research paper**.     Sure, that would help. I guarantee it.

I\u0026rsquo;ve seen occasional pieces elsewhere, but rarely of this length. And certainly not in widely-read publications. Seems to me this is a real lack of the Canadian public sphere. I\u0026rsquo;d be glad to be proved wrong.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a brief excerpt from the middle of the piece to give you a sense of its content and tone.\nLink: Fail better | Review | Guardian Unlimited Books.\nFirst things first: writers do not have perfect or even superior knowledge about the quality or otherwise of their own work - God knows, most writers are quite deluded about the nature of their own talent. But writers do have a different kind of knowledge than either professors or critics. Occasionally it's worth listening to. The insight of the practitioner is, for better or worse, unique. It's what you find in the criticism of Virginia Woolf, of Iris Murdoch, of Roland Barthes. What unites those very different critics is the confidence with which they made the connection between personality and prose. To be clear: theirs was neither strictly biographical criticism nor prescriptively moral criticism, and nothing they wrote was reducible to the childish formulations \"only good men write good books\" or \"one must know a man's life to understand his work\". But neither did they think of a writer's personality as an irrelevance. They understood style precisely as an expression of personality, in its widest sense. A writer's personality is his manner of being in the world: his writing style is the unavoidable trace of that manner. When you understand style in these terms, you don't think of it as merely a matter of fanciful syntax, or as the flamboyant icing atop a plain literary cake, nor as the uncontrollable result of some mysterious velocity coiled within language itself. Rather, you see style as a personal necessity, as the only possible expression of a particular human consciousness. Style is a writer's way of telling the truth. Literary success or failure, by this measure, depends not only on the refinement of words on a page, but in the refinement of a consciousness, what Aristotle called the education of the emotions.

These have combined to crash the unit cost of images across the board, regardless of category or intrinsic worth. For example, the introduction of Royalty Free 'microstock', which means you can now buy an image for $1.00, is just one factor that has dragged down professional fees...     The perception is \"if it's on the web, it's either free, or I'm gonna nick it anyway because, hey, 'they' can afford it\". The reality is that there are now more copyright-free or near-free images on the web than copyright images. Most of them will be on Flickr (owned by Yahoo!), MySpace (owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation) or the major corporate image portals. Neither Flickr nor MySpace exist to commercially leverage images, but clients now go there trawling for free content, so they don't have to pay a photographer for it. It has caused a crash in the unit cost of any images which aren't given away and which are licensed for profit.     So as a consequence, the only entities that are now able to make decent profits from photography are large corporations - because only those corporations have the infrastructure to aggregate images into massive hubs.     Fifteen years ago my sector had over a dozen photo-agencies which worked with freelance photographers, providing images to newspapers and magazines. Some specialized in sport, some in long-term documentary projects, some in hard news. Some were co-ops run by their members, some were big, some were small. In other words, the 'photo-eco-system' was reasonably diverse and a wide variety of imagery was produced by professional photographers earning decent fees.     Nearly all those agencies are out of business and now only a few major image corporations like Getty Images, Corbis - owned by Bill Gates - and Jupiter Images dominate the market and produce 'wholly owned' work - the corporation owns the copyright - either from staff or contract photographers. The work varies across the board, from high-end stock photography to news images.     If wholly-owned or virtually copyright-free (more commonly known as Royalty Free) content can be aggregated into a hub, and the economies of scale means the hub drives out smaller competitors, then huge profits be made.     Most anti-copyright arguments are based on a distaste for unfairly held \"property\". But for individual authors, it's not, and never really has been a property issue - it's our **labour** we're talking about. Copyright exists to allow us to earn a living, but routine flouting of this law simply strengthens the ability of large companies to seize that labour and sit on it for profit – as **their** property.     In reality, what is happening on the web is the transfer of the authors' labour to large corporations for nothing. Anti-copyright lobbyists have become either unwitting allies, or shills, for big business.    The Register also published a set of reader responses, which are not nearly as interesting.\n","date":1168776715,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1e81d283ad4dae9b11452fdfe3c638c5","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/food_for_though/","publishdate":"2007-01-14T12:11:55Z","relpermalink":"/post/food_for_though/","section":"post","summary":"Most of the argument about copyrights these days focuses on the attempts by big copyright holders (Disney etc) to extend the reach and length of copyright.

He not only lambasts the existing system, but actually has an alternative to propose (a medical prize to fund innovations). Here are some extracts:\n... In 1995 the Uruguay round trade negotiations concluded in the establishment of the World Trade Organization, which imposed US style intellectual property rights around the world. These rights were intended to reduce access to generic medicines and they succeeded. As generic medicines cost a fraction of their brand name counterparts, billions could no longer afford the drugs they needed. For example, a year's treatment with a generic cocktail of AIDS drugs might cost $130 (£65; ![{euro}](http://www.bmj.com/math/euro.gif)170) compared with $10 000 for the brand name version.[1](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1279#REF1) Billions of people living on $2-3 a day cannot afford $10 000, though they might be able to scrape together enough for the generic drugs. And matters are getting worse. New drug regimens recommended by the World Health Organization and second line defences that need to be used as resistance to standard treatments develops can cost much more.       Developing countries paid a high price for this agreement. But what have they received in return? Drug companies spend more on advertising and marketing than on research, more on research on lifestyle drugs than on life saving drugs, and almost nothing on diseases that affect developing countries only. This is not surprising. Poor people cannot afford drugs, and drug companies make investments that yield the highest returns. The chief executive of Novartis, a drug company with a history of social responsibility, said \"We have no model which would [meet] the need for new drugs in a sustainable way ... You can't expect for-profit organizations to do this on a large scale.\"       Research needs money, but the current system results in limited funds being spent in the wrong way...A medical prize fund provides an alternative. Such a fund would give large rewards for cures or vaccines for diseases like malaria that affect millions, and smaller rewards for drugs that are similar to existing ones, with perhaps slightly different side effects.

It is an article about Smithfield foods, the biggest pork processor in the world, and \u0026ndash; well, let\u0026rsquo;s just say it makes me glad I\u0026rsquo;m a vegetarian. Here are the first few paragraphs, but really you should print off the whole article (8 pages). Just don\u0026rsquo;t read it close to dinner.\nSmithfield Foods, the largest and most profitable pork processor in the world, killed 27 million hogs last year. That's a number worth considering. A slaughter-weight hog is fifty percent heavier than a person. The logistical challenge of processing that many pigs each year is roughly equivalent to butchering and boxing the entire human populations of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Detroit, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, San Francisco, Columbus, Austin, Memphis, Baltimore, Fort Worth, Charlotte, El Paso, Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston, Denver, Louisville, Washington, D.C., Nashville, Las Vegas, Portland, Oklahoma City and Tucson.     Smithfield Foods actually faces a more difficult task than transmogrifying the populations of America's thirty-two largest cities into edible packages of meat. Hogs produce three times more excrement than human beings do. The 500,000 pigs at a single Smithfield subsidiary in Utah generate more fecal matter each year than the 1.5 million inhabitants of Manhattan. The best estimates put Smithfield's total waste discharge at 26 million tons a year. That would fill four Yankee Stadiums. Even when divided among the many small pig production units that surround the company's slaughterhouses, that is not a containable amount.     Smithfield estimates that its total sales will reach $11.4 billion this year. So prodigious is its fecal waste, however, that if the company treated its effluvia as big-city governments do -- even if it came marginally close to that standard -- it would lose money. So many of its contractors allow great volumes of waste to run out of their slope-floored barns and sit blithely in the open, untreated, where the elements break it down and gravity pulls it into groundwater and river systems. Although the company proclaims a culture of environmental responsibility, ostentatious pollution is a linchpin of Smithfield's business model.     A lot of pig shit is one thing; a lot of highly toxic pig shit is another. The excrement of Smithfield hogs is hardly even pig shit: On a continuum of pollutants, it is probably closer to radioactive waste than to organic manure. The reason it is so toxic is Smithfield's efficiency. The company produces 6 billion pounds of packaged pork each year. That's a remarkable achievement, a prolificacy unimagined only two decades ago, and the only way to do it is to raise pigs in astonishing, unprecedented concentrations.     Smithfield's pigs live by the hundreds or thousands in warehouse-like barns, in rows of wall-to-wall pens. Sows are artificially inseminated and fed and delivered of their piglets in cages so small they cannot turn around. Forty fully grown 250-pound male hogs often occupy a pen the size of a tiny apartment. They trample each other to death. There is no sunlight, straw, fresh air or earth. The floors are slatted to allow excrement to fall into a catchment pit under the pens, but many things besides excrement can wind up in the pits: afterbirths, piglets accidentally crushed by their mothers, old batteries, broken bottles of insecticide, antibiotic syringes, stillborn pigs -- anything small enough to fit through the foot-wide pipes that drain the pits. The pipes remain closed until enough sewage accumulates in the pits to create good expulsion pressure; then the pipes are opened and everything bursts out into a large holding pond.    Continued here.\nOh yes.

Rifkin is completely, 180 degrees, wrong.\nLink: TheStar.com - opinion - The risks of too much city in a crowded world.\nThe coming year marks a great milestone in the human saga, a development similar in magnitude to the agricultural era and the Industrial Revolution. For the first time in history, a majority of human beings will be living in vast urban areas, many in megacities and suburban extensions with populations of 10 million or more, according to the United Nations.     We have become \"Homo Urbanus.\" ...     It's no accident that as we celebrate the urbanization of the world, we are quickly approaching another historic watershed: the disappearance of the wild. Rising population; growing consumption of food, water and building materials; expanding road and rail transport and urban sprawl continue to encroach on the remaining wild, pushing it to extinction. Scientists tell us that within the lifetime of today's children, the wild will disappear from the face of the Earth...     I don't want to spoil the party, but perhaps the commemoration of the urbanization of the human race in 2007 might be an opportunity to rethink the way we live. Certainly there is much to applaud about urban life: its rich cultural diversity and social intercourse and its dense commercial activity.       But the question is one of magnitude and scale.     We need to ponder how best to lower our population and develop sustainable urban environments that use energy and resources more efficiently, are less polluting and better designed to foster human-scale living arrangements.    But increasing urbanization is the best hope for cutting the population boom. If you live a rural existence, children are a source of prosperity: you need children to work, to support you, and so on. If you live an urban existence, children are a financial burden. That\u0026rsquo;s why there is no population boom (quite the opposite, in fact) in industrialized countries. His examples - Chicago and New York - are not from a country that has a booming population.

I intend to have even less to say than usual.\nWhether we like it or not, this is a season of consumption and so, for no good reason, here is a list of some of the best things I consumed in 2006.\nBest fiction I read. Three Junes by Julia Glass. Not my kind of book at all, which makes it all the more remarkable that I found it unputdownable.\nBest non-fiction I read. Consciousness Explained by Daniel Dennett, who is my new intellectual hero. It was published back in 1991, but my interest in this kind of stuff is relatively recent. I was put onto it via Susan Blackmore\u0026rsquo;s excellent Consciousness, A Very Short Introduction. A book I\u0026rsquo;ll be reading again in the next couple of weeks, and one that changed how I look at life \u0026amp; death.\nBest movie I watched. Hidden (Cache), directed by Michael Haneke. Watching movies or TV is usually thought to be a passive act. But with this movie you are absolutely engaged from the first shot, wondering what it is you are seeing. Are you the watcher? Are you watching the watcher? Are you a spectator watching the watched? It\u0026rsquo;s riveting. Then there is that one scene in the middle where, all of a sudden, everyone who sees it just gasps or swears. And to finish it off, there is the four-minute long final shot, which you scan from corner to corner for clues. Are there answers to the puzzles the movie poses? Who cares? Not me. Great stuff.\nBest TV Series I watched. Intelligence. It\u0026rsquo;s unusual to be able to watch a Canadian drama series and realize that it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;good, considering\u0026rdquo; but just really really good. From the makers of Da Vinci\u0026rsquo;s Inquest, and shown on CBC on Tuesdays, the multiple plotlines, shady deals, double crossing, and excellent acting from the leads (Ian Tracey and Klea Scott) as well as from the big supporting cast make this the best series I\u0026rsquo;ve seen since Oz.\nBest radio show I listened to. Continues to be Writers and Company, where Eleanor Wachtel does a great job of interviewing writers. She gives them space to talk, doesn\u0026rsquo;t get in the way, and as a result I\u0026rsquo;ve found several authors I like from this show.\nBest restaurant I visited. Brars. Who knew that in the middle of the warehouses and machine shops of the light-industry wasteland that is Brampton, in one of a million mini-malls scattered around Toronto airport, there is a vegetarian Indian restaurant that serves up to a thousand people in an evening, provides good value (it\u0026rsquo;s a buffet for $13), and the great atmosphere of many people enjoying their company and their food. Big tables, lots of rooms, and lots of food (and on the evening I was there, great company too). Being the only non-subcontinent people in the restaurant was a bit of an eye-opener as well - I guess I have some things to learn about this place I live.\nBest food shop I bought from - The usual culprits in Kitchener Waterloo are the gourmet places, like Vincenzo\u0026rsquo;s, who are pretty good I must admit. But this was the year I discovered Onkar Food \u0026amp; Spices on Hazelglen Road in Kitchener. Good Indian ingredients at good prices. Plus I get to walk the dog through Monarch Woods when I go there.\nBest other shop in K-W: J\u0026amp;J Cards and Collectibles on Weber Street, just south of University. Some years ago it was a place that sold Pokemon cards for the kids, Magic Cards and Dungeons and Dragons paraphernalia for the teenagers, and so on. In the last couple of years it has expanded, and it now has a great selection of board games, chess stuff, and lots more. The Brothers J have done a great job with this place.\nBest book launch of 2006 - No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart, at Words Worth books back in June. Great that so many people came out (and bought books).

What\u0026rsquo;s a little odd is that the price seems to be taken as a signal of quality even though the university itself did not change - that is, there is no guarantee that students who pay the full fees get what they are paying for.\nJohn Strassburger, the president of Ursinus College, a small liberal arts institution here in the eastern Pennsylvania countryside, vividly remembers the day that the chairman of the board of trustees told him the college was losing applicants because of its tuition.       [ ](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/education/12tuition.html?em\u0026ex=1166072400\u0026en=6785ef55f841945b\u0026ei=5087%0A#secondParagraph)   At Ursinus College officials determined that tuition was too low to draw enough students. So they raised it, and applications surged.       It was too low.     So early in 2000 the board voted to raise tuition and fees 17.6 percent, to $23,460 (and to include a laptop for every incoming student to help soften the blow). Then it waited to see what would happen.     Ursinus received nearly 200 more applications than the year before. Within four years the size of the freshman class had risen 35 percent, to 454 students. Applicants had apparently concluded that if the college cost more, it must be better.     “It’s bizarre and it’s embarrassing, but it’s probably true,” Dr. Strassburger said.     Ursinus also did something more: it raised student aid by nearly 20 percent, to just under $12.9 million, meaning that a majority of its students paid less than half price.     Ursinus is not unique. With the race for rankings and choice students shaping college pricing, the [University of Notre Dame](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_notre_dame/index.html?inline=nyt-org), Bryn Mawr College, [Rice University](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/rice_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org), the University of Richmond and Hendrix College, in Conway, Ark., are just a few that have sharply increased tuition to match colleges they consider their rivals, while also providing more financial assistance.     The recognition that families associate price with quality, and that a tuition rise, accompanied by discounts, can lure more applicants and revenue, has helped produce an economy in academe something like that in the health care system, with prices rising faster than inflation but with many consumers paying less than full price...

The relevant part of the shell team was about the same size as our team, as was the relevant part of kernel team. So that nets us a conservative estimate of 24 people involved in this feature. Also each team of 8 was separated by 6 layers of management from the leads, so let's add them in too, giving us 24 (6 * 3) - 1 (the shared manager) 41 total people with a voice in this feature. Twenty-four of them were connected sorta closely to the code, and of those twenty four there were exactly zero with final say in how the feature worked.

If I let myself glory in other consumer’s stupidity or ignorance, then I have given myself incentive to keep them ignorant and aligned myself with the retailers rather than those like me, fellow consumers. If everybody follows suit, then we remain collectively ignorant at war with each other rather than with the retailers trying to stratify and bamboozle us. (That’s why [tuangou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuangou) seems strangely appealing in theory.) This war of all against all caters to our individualism and reinforces competitiveness as the default mode of social interaction among peers. Shopping, which seems more and more the primary social activity, becomes a zero-sum game among consumers; we have no reason to cooperate. I gain when you lose. I fly cheaper when you pay more for your ticket. And I can think I’m a deserving winner and you are a deserving loser. This isn’t a big deal with airline tickets, when it comes to our annual salaries or general class prerogatives, it becomes a bigger deal. This kind of thinking leads people to conclude that the poor are simply stupid rather than structurally disadvantaged; being poor, as this Ezra Klein [post](http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/the_difference_.html) shows, is matter of having no safety net, no margin for error or bad luck in situations that are already stacked against you due to inherited disadvantages.    So what is tuangou? Well Wikipedia has an entry of course, which says it is \u0026ldquo;team buying\u0026rdquo;:\nSeveral people - sometimes friends, but possibly strangers connected over the internet - agree to approach a vendor of a specific product in order to haggle with the proprietor as a group in order to get discounts. The entire group agrees to purchase the same item. The shoppers benefit by paying less, and the business benefits by selling multiple items at once.    Wikipedia points to this article from the Economist.\n   ON AN otherwise quiet Friday afternoon in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, 500 shoppers gather outside a Gome electrical superstore in the downtown district. They arrive en masse at the designated time—June 16th at 4pm—that they had previously agreed online. Several hours later, they emerge clutching boxes, having secured 10-30% discounts on cameras, DVD players and flat-screen televisions. “It was great,” says Fairy Zhang. “We just bought an apartment and this way we can afford nice things for it.” The previous weekend, over 100 locals visited Meizhu Central, a well known furniture outlet, to haggle over the prices of kitchen cabinets and dining-room furniture...     Team buying turns haggling, a tradition in China, into an art-form. That such aggressive consumer behaviour has arisen in a country without much of a consumer economy and weak individual rights is less surprising than it might seem. In the countryside there are more and more organised protests against government corruption and dictatorial landlords, with even poor people using technology like the internet and mobile phones to help. Now their urban, middle-class brethren are adopting their tactics—if only for shopping. However, if China's economy ever slumps, urban consumers could use their organisational skills to confront the government directly. Beijing might be watching the spread of team buying with trepidation.

Mea culpa.\u0026rdquo;\nAnthony Asserted that \u0026ldquo;To write a book on the subject of individualism and free markets without reading Hayek is shocking\u0026rdquo;, and on that basis he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t read my book and I\u0026rsquo;m poorer by $2.\nNow Anthony has followed up with a full-length post of his own, arguing \u0026ndash; well, a whole bunch of things actually, which I am going to argue back at in\u0026hellip;\nThis weeks episode.\nAnthony says:\nThe focus of his book is individualism and competition, and you can't understand either without knowing about Hayek's [Individualism and Economics Order](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Individualism-Economic-Order-F-Hayek/dp/0226320936/sr=8-1/qid=1162638779/ref=sr_1_1/202-7284881-2859013?ie=UTF8\u0026s=books), and [The Use of Knowledge in Society](http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/HayekUseOfKnowledge.html).    Or, as he now puts it \u0026ldquo;you should read up on a topic if you\u0026rsquo;re writing a book on it\u0026rdquo;\nI think this little dispute has its roots in the difference between an education in the natural sciences and one in the social sciences. No one ever asked me if I had \u0026ldquo;read Heisenberg\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;read Pauling\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;read Einstein\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s just not a question that makes sense. Their discoveries get absorbed into the subject; new terminology arises around their work; new ways of expressing their insights are formulated. Pretty quickly reading the original is redundant, and is something you do for historical interest alone. Mathematics, of course, takes this tendency to the extreme, consciously purging every ounce of historical context from its theorems as it moves forward in the search for stark elegance.\nSo the idea that you need to \u0026ldquo;read Hayek\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;read Marx\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;read Weber\u0026rdquo; is really a bit odd. The insights they had have either faded or become part of the discipline \u0026ndash; or at least, in the more fractious world of economics, one strand of it. So yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve \u0026ldquo;read Friedman\u0026rdquo;, and yes I\u0026rsquo;ve \u0026ldquo;read Becker\u0026rdquo; and so on. And I\u0026rsquo;ve even read a bit of Hayek (I did just say I haven\u0026rsquo;t read much). But really, unless you are interested in the historical context of the arguments at the time \u0026ndash; the whole Lange-Lerner market socialism thing for example, or where Margaret Thatcher got her inspiration \u0026ndash; I should not have missed a lot if economics as a discipline has done its job, and I trust it has.\nSo I did go and read the essay on Knowledge in Society, about the price system and how it captures and coordinates specialized local knowledge and expertise, and why central planning is doomed to fail. Fine. These are arguments that have indeed become part of the mainstream of economics and yes, for the record, I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with them. But let\u0026rsquo;s face it, a lot has become understood since 1945 when he wrote this essay.\nOne reason I dislike Hayek\u0026rsquo;s writing in this essay, from a personal point of view, is its consciously broad-brush approach. This is what I meant when I said \u0026ldquo;The bits I have [read] always seemed to be talking about a reality I didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize.\u0026rdquo; Journalists know there are two ways to tell a story: from the particular to the general and from the general to the particular. Hayek starts big (look at that title \u0026ldquo;The Use of Knowledge in Society\u0026rdquo;). Myself, I like to start small and specific (which is why I called my book after an everyday happening like shopping). When the devil is in the details, the \u0026ldquo;think big\u0026rdquo; approach is likely to miss important things, and I think this is a lesson that most economists have learned since Hayek.\nGeorge Akerlof, for example, wrote in his Nobel lecture that \u0026ldquo;In the late 1960s there was a shift in the job description of economic theorists\u0026hellip; Since that time, both micro and macroeconomics have developed a Scarry-ful book of models designed to incorporate into economic theory a whole variety of realistic behaviors.\u0026rdquo; To read Hayek now is to read an essay that overreaches. It does not tell me what happens in any one situation. Stiglitz gets it right when he says that assuming away market failures is like leaving Hamlet out of the play.\nAnthony disagrees I\u0026rsquo;m sure, and we are left with what Dipper described as \u0026ldquo;my assumptions against your assumptions\u0026rdquo;.\nTo sum up, there is nothing in what I wrote that I would change having read this essay. It is true that I don\u0026rsquo;t talk directly in the book about the role of markets as a mechanism for processing information and social knowledge, but hey, it\u0026rsquo;s only 240 pages, you can\u0026rsquo;t write about everything.\nAnthony says:\nIt's ludicrous [for me] to say that a cover-to-cover reading of the book is a pre-requisite for any opinion to be formed.    Just for the record, what I actually wrote was\nWell, I might say that dismissing a book without reading **any of it **is shocking too, if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done it so many times myself.\nSo relax, we all have to choose what we pay attention to and what we don\u0026rsquo;t. Go ahead, have opinions, I know I do.\nBut I still think it\u0026rsquo;s a bit cheeky to accuse me of not doing my homework on the basis of what I wrote about not reading much Hayek.\nWhat about those toilets?\nAnthony says I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about toilets.\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to work too hard to defend a blog post. There are indeed inconsistencies there - fair enough. But I actually don\u0026rsquo;t think the biggest cause of water-wasting toilets is flat-rate water payment (which has, I think, receded anyway over the years). The costs of information are at least as significant. Quick, what portion of your water bill is from toilet flushes? So I stand by my basic argument that in this case neither state nor market succeeded until our individual hero came along and solved the problem.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s it for now. Thanks to Anthony for letting me know about his post and for the free publicity to his readers.\n","date":1162686589,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"6fa883738aac07521d2547c1d92846b6","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/on_doing_my_hom/","publishdate":"2006-11-05T00:29:49Z","relpermalink":"/post/on_doing_my_hom/","section":"post","summary":"The Story So Far\nAnthony Evans and I, as well as the Dorset Dipper, got into a bit of argy-bargy in the comments following Chris Dillow\u0026rsquo;s review of No One Makes You Shop At Wal-Mart.

I. Dyakonov called Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? Dyakonov goes on about the theory of error-correction in (hypothetical) quantum computers, which I know nothing of, and in particular criticizes the \u0026ldquo;threshold theorem\u0026rdquo;, but he also makes some more elementary points that I did, so here are a few excerpts from Mr/Ms Dyakonov\u0026rsquo;s paper just to show I\u0026rsquo;m not completely out to lunch.\nThe enormous literature devoted to [fault-tolerant quantum computation]... is purely mathematical. It is mostly produced by computer scientists with a limited understanding of physics and a somewhat restricted perception of quantum mechanics as nothing more than unitary transformations in Hilbert space plus \"entanglement\".     [on decoherence] While the relaxation of two-level systems was thoroughly studied during a large part of the 20th century, and is quite well understood, in the quantum computing literature there is a strong tendency to make it look as an obscure quantum phenomenon.    Elsewhere, Dyakonov takes aim at the assumptions of ideal behaviour that permeate discussions of the feasibility of quantum computing, and to my mind does a pretty good job of bringing a little reality into the discussion.

D1.\nMaximum Performance Testing of Popular Toilet Models, 7th Edition, Canadian Water and Wastewater Association.\nThe debate seems endless. The left says the market doesn\u0026rsquo;t work; the right says government just makes things worse. It\u0026rsquo;s an old argument, and it\u0026rsquo;s time to get it sorted out.\nThe trouble is, this argument is always made in the abstract. It\u0026rsquo;s just generalities. Principal-agent problems here, collective action problems there, it\u0026rsquo;s just so much verbal diarrhoea.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re going to have any chance of a realistic answer, you have to get your hands dirty and take a close look at a real problem. So that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do.\nAnd the best place to look? In the toilet. Or more specifically, in the low-flush toilet which, after many years of messy failures, is now positively flushed with success. What made it succeed? Was this the innovation of private industry? Schumpeterian creative destruction at work? Or is this a case of state-mandated standards flushing away a problem that the free market just left floating in the pan?\nThanks to the Toronto Star (link works for free until the weekend) we now have the unadulterated story. Pretty much everything I say here comes from that article.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start at the beginning. In places where households don\u0026rsquo;t pay the full cost of their water, which is a lot of places in North America, there is a free-rider problem when it comes to water conservation. We\u0026rsquo;d all save money if our toilets used less water when they flushed. It saves in water treatment costs, and it saves because there is less water to send through the pipes. It\u0026rsquo;s just a good thing. But if we don\u0026rsquo;t pay the whole cost of water ourselves, the best choice for each of us is to stick with our current toilet and let others invest in a low-flush model.\nBut the free market was failing to deliver a low-flush toilet. While government bureaucrats were of the opinion that 6 litres is enough to get rid of what needs to be got rid of, the toilet manufacturers were all selling models that delivered 13 litres (in imperial measurements, that\u0026rsquo;s three furlongs and a fortnight) with each pull of the chain (are there actually any made with chains any more? It would be a great retro item I think.) Why was the free market failing? Well, probably for lack of a push from consumers. If you\u0026rsquo;re not paying the full cost of the water, you don\u0026rsquo;t really care whether your toilet uses 6 litres or 13.\nSo, the obvious solution here is government intervention, and in some places (the USA) in the early 1990\u0026rsquo;s the government decided to get tough, and used its monopoly on force \u0026ndash; you know, that monopoly the libertarians are always complaining about \u0026ndash; to compel the toilet manufacturers cartel to adopt an environmentally friendly line. They outlawed high-volume toilets. One for the state! (although to be honest I don\u0026rsquo;t know which level of the state it was).\nBut as we\u0026rsquo;ve been told by the libertarians and right wingers, government intervention does not necessarily improve matters, and one reason is the old problem of information. You can sell a toilet that delivers 6 litres per flush, but as a customer how do you know if that toilet is going to do what is needed? Well, before you buy it, you don\u0026rsquo;t, so there is an obvious \u0026ldquo;market for lemons\u0026rdquo; problem here. The state can lead the manufacturers to use less water, but it can\u0026rsquo;t make them flush thoroughly. Someone needs to do some testing to establish some clear standards, and who is going to do that?\nMarket enthusiasts will not be surprised to hear that although the US government (whichever part it was) had got tough in the letter of the law, it seems that it didn\u0026rsquo;t follow through, leaving it to municipalities to find a solution. Seattle and Oakland trusted the Third Way idea that testing could be contracted out to a private industry group called the National Home Builders\u0026rsquo; Association, which describes itself \u0026ldquo;a Washington, D.C.-based trade association whose mission is to enhance the climate for housing and the building industry.\u0026rdquo; Market sceptics would just know these tests aren\u0026rsquo;t going to be really solid, and so it proved: they used a set of weighted sponges. Sponges!?\nWhether this faulty testing was a fault of Blairite PPP illusions or not, the 1990\u0026rsquo;s was a decade in which government intervention seemed to have made all things loo-related worse.\nThe most vocal opponent of the low-flush mandate is, of course, ex-Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry. He describes the low-flush toilets as toilets that can leave you lurking in the bathroom at a party \u0026ldquo;for what seems (to you) like several presidential administrations, flushing, checking, waiting, flushing, checking.\u0026rdquo; If you have to flush two or three times, a 6-litre toilet does not save water, and for years Barry was a vocal defender of \u0026ldquo;the older 3.5 gallon models - the toilets that made this nation great; the toilets that our Founding Fathers fought and died for.\u0026rdquo; (For those who want the primary source material, much is collected in collections such as Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down).\nMr. Barry has written a lot about toilets, and most of it has been re-read to me by my two teenage offspring, interrupted by long bouts of giggling until cornflakes come out of their nose. For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know him, here is a little of Mr. Barry, writing in 2004:\n   I am often criticized for writing immature ''bathroom'' humor, and not enough about important topics. So today I'm going to write about a major international event that is going to take place Nov. 17-19 in Beijing, China: The World Toilet Summit.     I am not making up the World Toilet Summit. It was brought to my attention by alert reader Marc Howell, who alerted me to the World Toilet Organization, a group dedicated to improving the world's public toilets, with a website at worldtoilet.org. (''Org'' is a sound made by many of the world's public toilets.)     This site states that the World Toilet Summit is a gathering of ''the KEY DECISION MAKERS, KEY OFFICIALS and the MOVERS AND SHAKERS'' of the international toilet industry. The Beijing host committee -- which includes (I am still not making any of this up) an official named ''Stone Wang'' -- states that the summit will feature workshops on ''hot topics'' in the toilet industry. For example, Mr. Seok-Nam Gang of the Korea Clean Toilet Association will present ``Toilets As Tourism Attraction.''     Other hot topics include ''Toilets as Marketing Tools'' and ''Generating Revenue Through Advertisements in Good Toilets.'' There will also be a presentation of the ''Loo of the Year Awards,'' a tour of ''toilets and related facilities in Beijing,'' and a ``dinner show.''     I think the World Toilet Summit is a great idea, because most of the world's public toilets, in a word, stink. I'm not saying the United States is perfect in this department. We've made some serious mistakes, the worst being the introduction of ''low-flow'' toilets, which clog when asked to handle anything larger than, say, a molecule.     Also I am not a fan of those high-tech public toilets with the automatic sensors that either (a) become overexcited and flush themselves 37 times before you even sit down, or (b) lapse into a coma, so that when you're done you find yourself waving your arms like a lunatic and loudly remarking ''Well, I'm done!'' in an effort to revive your toilet so it will flush and you can leave, while the people waiting the stall wonder what kind of sick pervert thing you are doing in there.    (I should add that the second World Toilet Forum is taking place in less than a month in Bangkok. Its theme, which I also am not making up, is \u0026ldquo;Happy Toilet, Healthy Life\u0026rdquo;.)\nBut back to the main story.\nAs state-opponents might expect, a set of black markets emerged as private industries tried to improve customer satisfaction. Plumbers would fix the toilets so that they delivered more than the 6-litre amount. Manufacturers claimed 6-litre compliance when their toilets actually used more. And more blatant than anything, Dave Barry reported frequently on prohibition-inspired smuggling of 13-litre Canadian toilets across the border by the Canadian toilet cartel. Private industry was finding a way around the government mandate.\nBut then something changed. The City of Toronto, forswearing the full-fledged coercive tactics used by the brutal US regime, decided instead to offer rebates to people who would install low-flush toilets.\nThe problem of testing raised its ugly head again, and the City of Toronto got lucky. They contracted Veritec Consulting of Mississauga, where works modern day hero Bill Gauley (47). When Gauley started testing toilets he did not use sponges (\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many people want to flush sponges\u0026rdquo; he said), but used mashed potatoes and mashed-up bananas instead. The result was devastating. He proved that existing toilets just were not performing as advertised. He extended his work and joined up with \u0026ldquo;politics guy\u0026rdquo; John Koeller of California. They were funded by a number of Canadian and American municipalities to produce the definitive work, and in 2003 they pulled the handle on the MaP Report (Maximum Performance Testing of Popular Toilet Models).\nThe industry responded with threats to sue, but once they saw the evidence they were convinced. And since then, the Star reports, testing has been paid for by the manufacturers themselves and performance has improved by leaps and bounds. Not only that, but manufacturers now proudly stamp \u0026ldquo;MaP tested and approved\u0026rdquo; on their products. Now it is common for toilets to be able to flush not only 250 grams of waste (\u0026ldquo;the maximum male average\u0026rdquo; used as a benchmark, which half the toilets in the 2003 survey failed to flush) but 500 grams, even 1000 grams. And as Bill Gauley says \u0026ldquo;if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen 1,000 grams in a toilet\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMarket sceptics will note that, as Joseph Stiglitz emphasizes in his survey of his own work \u0026ldquo;Whither Socialism\u0026rdquo;, the provision of information is a costly exercise that is itself open to free riding. Information is a public good, and now Veritec\u0026rsquo;s MaP testing results are available for everyone to read on the Internet. No individual would find it worth making the effort to do the testing; it took a large city (and a lot of luck) to get us round that particular U-bend.\nSo who is responsible for the happy ending? Is it government in the form of the City of Toronto? Is it \u0026ldquo;the industry\u0026rdquo; who seem to have bought in to the project?\nThe story shows that the state/market dichotomy is false, and that the phrasing of the question is at fault. Posing the issue as \u0026ldquo;state versus market\u0026rdquo; loses touch with reality in the face of this intricate cross-pollination between municipalities, the US Environmental Protection Agency (who is likely to develop a labelling system based on the Veritec tests), Veritec itself (which is a private consultancy) and quasi-state bodies such as the Canadian Water and Wastewater Association.\nThe closer we look, the more dependent on the specifics it becomes. The story even has an international angle, as today\u0026rsquo;s MaP tests have moved beyond mashed potato to use cylinders of miso, the brownish soy-based paste from Japan, encased in LifeStyles brand condoms so that they can be reused. And much as I\u0026rsquo;m sceptical of the benefits of industry-led globalization, I have to admit that the idea came from private company Toto, makers of the formidable Toto Drake toilet. It is indeed a tangled web.\nPerhaps the message is that, when we look closely enough, economics falls apart and gives way to sociology and psychology. Perhaps it is that history is, after all, made by individuals, specifically individuals who are prepared to spend hours developing \u0026ldquo;test specimens\u0026rdquo; and flushing them down toilets over and over and over again. Perhaps it is that we need to seek a Buddhist-like middle way between the Scylla of the market and the Charybdis of the state, but a middle way that has a more human side to it than the metric driven public-private partnerships. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But one thing I do know is that Bill Gauley deserves the thanks of all of us. Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll even get a low-flush toilet myself.\n","date":1161819986,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"03630fbe98945d6f8080afffeae004d6","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_state_versu/","publishdate":"2006-10-25T23:46:26Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_state_versu/","section":"post","summary":"The Flusher King by Peter Scowen, Toronto Star, Sunday October 22, 2006, p.

I know it\u0026rsquo;s Not Done to comment on reviews, but maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll make an exception here.\nFirst, he wonders how widespread the market failures I describe are. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that there is a way to answer this question. A market failure does not always reveal itself in any obvious way. When eminent economists find it difficult to agree even on such empirical questions as \u0026ldquo;is inequality increasing in the USA\u0026rdquo;, I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether we\u0026rsquo;ll see an empirical answer to the prevalence of market failures. And the costs of overcoming asymmetric information problems are sometimes hard to spot because there are so many different mechanisms. But there are a couple of observations that I can make:\n The broader view you take of a market \u0026ndash; that is, as you move away from the purely monetary \u0026amp; private aspects of a transaction to take account of other factors such as status, norms, social impact \u0026ndash; the more externalities come into play, and so the more common failures will be. That is, economists themselves will see only a small part of the failure of markets - others, such as sociologists, will see more.\n There are some industries that are almost exclusively devoted to correcting market failures, and so their costs could be seen as a measure of market failure. Advertising (large-scale at least, not classifieds) and law spring to mind. And it is important to note that just because information asymmetries can be overcome at a big cost doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean the problem is solved.\n  His second point is about Hayek, whom I\u0026rsquo;ve never read much of. The bits I have always seemed to be talking about a reality I didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize. So I can\u0026rsquo;t really address the point, and will go and read. Mea culpa.\nBut the third point Chris makes, which is that I don\u0026rsquo;t say much about government failure, I do have an excuse for. Basically, it seemed to me that no one needs much convincing these days that governments can, left to themselves, screw things up pretty badly. You only have to read EMT Tom Reynolds writing about government targets today to know that (although, come to think of it, the idiocies he describes are rife in private industry too). Cynicism about politicians and governments is so widespread that the point about bureaucracies hardly needs to be made. What is important is to tackle this idea that markets are a fine alternative.\nWell, these scribbles hardly do justice to the points, but that\u0026rsquo;s all I\u0026rsquo;ve got this evening.

He would tell me that Dado used to burn rocket casings and pour the melted plastic onto the stomachs of onetime Taliban fighters he and his men had captured. Abdul Baqi also recalled that during the civil war that ended with the Taliban’s seizure of Kabul, Dado and his men had a checkpoint where they “grabbed young boys and robbed people.” Mullah Omar and his followers formed the Taliban in 1994 to, among other things, bring some justice to Afghanistan and to expel predatory commanders like Dado. But in the early days of Karzai’s government, these regional warlords re-established themselves, with American financing, to fill the power vacuum that the coalition forces were unwilling to fill themselves. The warlords freely labeled their many enemies Al Qaeda or Taliban in order to push the Americans to eradicate them. Some of these men were indeed Taliban. Most, like Abdul Baqi, had accepted their loss of power, but they rejoined the Taliban as a result of harassment. Amir Dado’s own abuses had eventually led to his removal from the Helmand government at   United Nations   insistence. As one Western diplomat, who requested anonymity out of personal safety concerns, put it: “Amir Dado kept his own prison, authorized the use of serious torture, had very little respect for human life and made security worse.” Yet when I later met Amir Dado in Kabul, he pulled out a letter that an officer in the U.S. Special Forces had written requesting that the Afghan Ministry of Defense install him as Helmand’s police chief and claiming that in his absence “the quality of security in the Helmand Province has dramatically declined.”    On a Taliban video:\nThey invoke a nostalgia for the jihad against the Russians and inspire their viewers to rise up again. One begins with clattering Chinooks disgorging American soldiers into the desert. Then we see the new Afghan government onstage, focusing in on the   Northern Alliance   warlords —   Abdul Rashid Dostum   , Burhanuddin Rabbani, Karim Khalili, Muhammad Fahim, Ismail Khan, Abdul Sayyaf. It cuts to American soldiers doing push-ups and pinpointing targets on maps; next it shows bombs the size of bathtubs dropping from planes and missiles emblazoned with “Royal Navy” rocketing through the sky; then it moves to hospital beds and wounded children. Message: America and   Britain   brought back the warlords and bombed your children. In the next clip, there are metal cages under floodlights and men in orange jumpsuits, bowed and crouching. It cuts back to the wild eyes of   John Walker Lindh   and shows trucks hauling containers crammed with young Afghan and Pakistani prisoners — Taliban, hundreds of whom would suffocate to death in those containers, supposedly at the command of the warlord and current army chief of staff, General Dostum. Then back to American guards wheeling hunger-striking Guantánamo prisoners on gurneys. Interspliced are older images, a bit fuzzy, of young Afghan men, hands tied behind their backs, heads bowed, hauled off by Communist guards. The message: Foreigners have invaded our lands again; Americans, Russians — no difference.    Interviewing a school headmistress and landowner, also a Ministry of Women\u0026rsquo;s Affairs deputy:\nShe weighed the Taliban regime against this new one in terms of pragmatic choices, not terror or ideology. She said that she had just wrapped up the case of a girl who had been kidnapped and raped by Kandahari police officers, something that would not have happened under the Taliban. “Their security was outstanding,” she said.     Under the Taliban, she said, a poppy ban was enforced. “Now the governors tell the people, ‘Just cultivate a little bit,”’ she said. “So people take this opportunity and grow a lot.” The farmers lease land to grow poppies. The British and the police eradicate it. The farmer can’t pay back the landowner. “So instead of paying, he gives the landowner his daughter.”    The picture is depressing, it is complicated, and it has the aura of reality. We desperately need to hear more stories like this. The current debate is \u0026ldquo;us against the bad guys - fight or leave?\u0026rdquo; is so hopelessly out of contact that it is not worth having.\n","date":1161559649,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"454444f1439fe1109786db4dcbd67c0b","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/in_the_land_of_/","publishdate":"2006-10-22T23:27:29Z","relpermalink":"/post/in_the_land_of_/","section":"post","summary":"In the Land of the Taliban - New York Times - Elizabeth Rubin\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a couple of short essays to put up here, but they are not quite ready yet.

I\u0026rsquo;ll post if they accept it.\nPolitical debate in Canada is stale, swinging between those who look to government for solutions and those who look to the free market. This pendulum has swung back and forth on all the major issues: health care, education, industrial policy, and on and on.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded is a timely reminder that many of the most promising ideas for a better world are about neither governments nor business. The source of these ideas is often the periphery of societies rather than the centre, and they work from the bottom up rather than the top down. The prize is also a reminder that new ideas are often difficult to classify: some claim that the ideas behind Grameen are socialist, others that they are capitalist, and others that this is an innovative form of aid to the poor. But most importantly, pretty much everyone agrees that this is an idea that works.\nThe Grameen Bank was created at a cost of $27 in rural Bangladesh to address a very mundane problem facing poor villagers: lack of credit. Before you can grow crops you need money to buy seeds; before you can sell milk you need money to buy a cow; before you can sell bamboo chairs you need money to buy bamboo. The usual route to get this money is to go to a bank for a loan, but big banks can\u0026rsquo;t make much money from tiny loans to poor people, and banks also face a set of problems caused by lack of detailed information. The usual way for a borrower to guarantee a loan is to use some of their possessions as collateral to guarantee the loan, but poor people have no collateral \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s what being poor is all about \u0026ndash; so there would be no way for a bank to be confident that its loans would be repaid.\nFor a big bank to individually identify the good risks and the bad risks among its customers would be a costly enterprise, especially compared to the small amounts of the loans that poor people need. So even if a bank were to set up in rural Bangladesh, they would have to charge high interest rates to cover the bad risks, and these high interest rates make loans unaffordable for the very people who need them. End result, no banks.\nWithout banks, many villagers went to local moneylenders for loans. These moneylenders live locally and had a virtual monopoly on loans, so interest rates were often extortionate and the borrowers were kept in a state of permanent indebtedness. Women faced an additional barrier because they typically had little control over the way household money was spent. So in addition to not having any money, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t borrow it and the rural poor were trapped in poverty.\nIn the 1970\u0026rsquo;s Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank entered the picture with a conviction that they could help people to break out of the credit trap by providing small loans, typically a few tens of dollars, to help people get on their feet. These small loans came to be called micro-credit. Despite the word \u0026ldquo;bank\u0026rdquo; in its name, profit is not the primary goal of the Grameen Bank, but it did seek to be self-sustaining and so it needed some new ideas to make its convictions work where the big banks would not go.\nThe biggest single innovation, and one that has caught the attention of many around the world, was that the Bank does not lend to individuals, but instead to small groups of borrowers. For each group the members get their loan in turn, rather than all at once, with the member most in need \u0026ndash; as identified by the group itself \u0026ndash; getting the loan first. If the loan is not repaid, none of the other members in the group get their loan.\nThis simple but ingenious group-lending model is a way of overcoming the information problems that stymied the banks. The group members have an incentive to identify reliable partners, so that they will not lose their own chance for a loan because of a group member defaulting. The group model also helps to prevent members from undertaking projects that are too risky, because other group members would not go along with harebrained schemes that are likely to fail. The fact that each member\u0026rsquo;s loan depends on the repayment of the others lends itself to mutual support so that the early loans get repaid. Mutual support is supplemented by peer pressure among the members of the group to ensure that each member is committed to repaying. The group lending model is a framework that encourages people to achieve things together that, separately, they could not.\nThe model works. The Grameen Bank has made loans to over 6 million poor Bangladeshis. The repayment rate on loans is around 98%, which is a remarkable number for people living so close to the edge. What\u0026rsquo;s more, almost all the borrowers are women, and the loans give them a chance to break free not only of poverty, but also of many of the social constraints that have prevented them from having control over their own lives. The Bank is now largely owned by its members, and ten of its 13-member board of directors are women.\nThe Grameen model has been widely imitated, with a recent report saying that over 25,000 microfinance organizations now exist, each serving on average over 25,000 low-income customers. Like any other promising new idea, it has been built on by the industrious, exploited by the unscrupulous, and improved by the imaginative. Some endeavours succeed and some fail. The group lending model of micro-credit is not a panacea, but it is an innovation that has made a real difference to millions of people.\nGroup lending does not fit easily into the right-wing/left-wing spectrum. Former World Bank president James Wolfehnson claims that the award testifies to \u0026ldquo;the power of entrepreneurialism\u0026rdquo;, but the Bank is not profit-motivated \u0026ndash; in fact it is aimed at fixing things that the pursuit of profit alone has not been able to fix. The Grameen Bank is not an example of \u0026ldquo;entrepreneurship\u0026rdquo; unless you extend the idea to mean \u0026ldquo;anyone with an idea who works at it\u0026rdquo;, which is a bit far fetched. At the same time, this is a private initiative that is largely independent of the state and which does foster small businesses, so it does not fall under the usual umbrella of left-wing initiatives.\nBeing left-wing myself, I\u0026rsquo;d like to label the Grameen Bank left-wing in the sense used by philosopher Peter Singer: it is explicitly on the side of the weak, not the powerful, but in the end it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. What does matter is that it works.\nThe success of the Grameen Bank reminds us that many of our most influential ideas start with small groups a long way from the centres of power and influence, finding ways for people to work together to solve immediate, concrete problems. The most influential ideas about how to make cities more livable started with Jane Jacobs looking out of her kitchen window in Greenwich Village, and it was Jacobs who said that \u0026ldquo;new ideas need old buildings\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; that they come from the unfashionable parts of town where rents are cheap.\nIn the middle of all the debate over health services and social services the feminist movement created sexual assault centres and other crisis services for women, addressing a whole set of needs that were not being met within the established framework. Innovations in open source software production such as Linux, and in open content production such as Wikipedia have started independently of governments or markets. The anti-sweatshop movement has led to the creation of independent workplace-monitoring organizations that are a necessary step in pushing companies to implement good working conditions. The list is long and diverse, and each of these initiatives has gone through times when it is not taken seriously, has been torn apart (or nearly so) by internal dissent, and has faced tough and sometimes unresolved decisions about how to work with existing institutions.\nBut each idea has made a difference, and each provides far more inspiration than the stale \u0026ldquo;government versus markets\u0026rdquo; debates we hear so much.\n","date":1161023526,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"76dde445f0133614b7ebfb4a754071f6","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/grameen_bank_an/","publishdate":"2006-10-16T18:32:06Z","relpermalink":"/post/grameen_bank_an/","section":"post","summary":"I submitted this piece as an op-ed to the Kitchener Waterloo Record.

If you weren\u0026rsquo;t there to hear me, I don\u0026rsquo;t think you missed anything. The University event was better, with about 20 people there and some good discussion afterwards. Most interesting was a comment about an intriguing high-tech public bicycle system in Lyon named Velo\u0026rsquo;v, which seems to be a big success according to a Guardian article reprinted here.\nKitchener NDP recently hosted Peggy Nash, a new MP for Parkdale- High Park in Toronto. I was very impressed. She spoke for 45 minutes with no notes on a wide variety of topics, from a recent fact-finding visit to Lebanon to the ins and outs of Parliamentary committees and was obviously smart and very well informed. I was asked to present her with a copy of my book as a thank you for the visit, which was a privilege.\nAfter the meeting I met two philosophy profs from the University of Waterloo.

When I bike to work I go past the Perimeter Institute in Theoretical Physics at the beginning of my ride, and then go within a stone's throw of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the end, both of which are making waves these days. All these brainy young things pushing the boundaries of what we know and don't know, it's fun to watch.  The main media event recently has been the publication of the book \u0026ldquo;The Trouble with Physics\u0026rdquo; by the Perimeter Insitute\u0026rsquo;s Lee Smolin, which is a criticism of String Theory and its 30-year failure to prove itself as something more than a promising candidate for a theory of everything. Smolin\u0026rsquo;s book has been widely reviewed, often in conjunction with Peter Woit\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Not Even Wrong\u0026rdquo; which argues much the same thing. The title \u0026rdquo;Not Even Wrong\u0026rdquo; was a devastating putdown coined by Enrico Fermi of another physicist\u0026rsquo;s work - the implication being it was so mistaken that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t even show why and how it was incorrect. My own work was in the relatively mundane work of molecules rather than cosmological elementary particles; that is, it was quantum, but on our side of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, not the other side. Both books argue that String Theory has become so removed from experiment that it has ceased to be science, and has become prone to building elaborate edifices on an insufficiently sound physical basis.\nWhile PI has made the biggest splash locally, the Institute for Quantum Computing is a rising star too. And Quantum Computing is something that I feel I can get more of a handle on than String Theory, so I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading a bit about it. And what I see either exposes me for a quantum fuddy-duddy or suggests that Quantum Computing (QC from here on) could do with listening to the critiques of Smolin and applying it to themselves.\nSo here is what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with quantum computing from what I can see. (Disclaimer: these opinions are based on a number of popular articles, my attempts to follow Scott Aaronson\u0026rsquo;s excellent weblog Shtetl-Optimized, and the bit I have read of Jozef Gruska\u0026rsquo;s 1999 text \u0026ldquo;Quantum Computing\u0026rdquo;, which I actually got out of the library last week. These opinions are worth exactly what you paid for them.)\nReading a QC book is an odd thing for a regular physics type. Where are the Hamiltonians? Few and far between, it seems (\u0026ldquo;Hamiltonian\u0026rdquo; is mentioned in only a literal handful of places \u0026ndash; five \u0026ndash; in Gruska). Everything is about the action of unitary operators on states. For anyone reading this who is not a physicist, here\u0026rsquo;s what that means. In physics, when things interact, that interaction is described by a Hamiltonian. If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve a problem, your first step is to construct a Hamiltonian operator that describes the interaction you are studying, and then solve the equations that come from that. Unitary operators, on the other hand, describe a change in a quantum system from one state to another, which may sound like the same thing but isn\u0026rsquo;t. In regular computers, circuits consist of many gates that carry out elementary operations (AND, OR, and so on). If you had a quantum \u0026ldquo;gate\u0026rdquo; then a unitary operator describes the change from input to output (that\u0026rsquo;s the change in state), and ignores the way in which the system gets from the one end of the gate to the other. The Hamiltonian would describe the actual physical operation that happens as the light or electron or nuclear spin goes from the input to the output.\nThat still might not be very clear, so here\u0026rsquo;s the end result: the theory of QC is built in a manner that has become deliberately divorced from the real world. The \u0026ldquo;implementation\u0026rdquo; or the actual building of a computer is consciously separated from the theory of the logic and algorithms that you would build on top of this computer. There is a division of labour between theory and experiment that is present right down to the way the theory is constructed, and that is a bit of a problem because it means that every single thing that the theorists say is conditional. All the theorems they prove need a big asterisk next to them saying \u0026ldquo;as long as someone can make a computer\u0026rdquo;. As a footnote Richard Feynman, who knew what he was doing, did some early explorations in Quantum Computing and did approach it by building Hamiltonians and putting together Schrodinger equations - just what you\u0026rsquo;d expect a physicist to do.\nYou can see why the discipline has gone in this manner. Regular old classical computing, after all, followed a similar path. It started off with mathematicians (von Neumann and Turing) who set out a logical architecture of computers and algorithms, and this work was followed (loosely speaking, and as best I understand) by the engineers once the transistor was invented. And it makes sense that those interested in exploring algorithms can do so without needing to know all about welding - this stuff is complicated enough as it is. But we should keep in mind that there is always the possibility that the success of regular computing will not be repeated. The proof of the pudding and all that.\nThe second thing that bothers me about QC is related to this division of labour. Everywhere you look they are talking about \u0026ldquo;entanglement\u0026rdquo; and all the things that go along with it: Bell\u0026rsquo;s inequalities, EPR experiments and so on. In Gruska\u0026rsquo;s book Everett (of the \u0026ldquo;many-worlds interpretation\u0026rdquo;) is mentioned as many times as Hamiltonian. Again, for a quantum fuddy-duddy this raises red flags. The wierdness of the quantum world is seductive - enough that my 1st year lecturer (the late Peter Dawber) felt he had to warn us \u0026rdquo;this is interesting, but it\u0026rsquo;s interpretation. My advice is learn how to calculate and solve problems, and don\u0026rsquo;t get stuck in the philosophical quicksand\u0026rdquo;. Good advice that has been repeated by many a lecturer, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. And yet here are these QC-ers diving headlong into entangled states, and spending more time on them than on things with actual Hamiltonians. Looking in Gruska\u0026rsquo;s index again, entanglement merits 42 mentions. Perhaps this is mainly a rhetorical point, but I do think it is worth making because entanglement is built into the culture of quantum computing.\nEntanglement is connected to what happens when you prepare a multi-particle quantum state and then let the particles become separated. So you get paragraphs like this:\nPrepare a system with two particles, each of which can have two values of spin, and send them off in opposite directions. Then measure one of the particles to find its spin. This measurement then immediately fixes the spin of the other particle, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a long way away. The state of the two particles is entangled.\nBut you could also write this paragraph this way.\nPrepare a system with two particles, each of which can have two values of spin, and send them off in opposite directions. Then measure the state of the system by checking one particle. This measurement tells you the spin of both particles.\nThe difference is that in the second phrasing avoids mention of entanglement, and focuses on the fact that this is a single quantum system we are talking about here, and that however far apart the two particles end up being, they still have to comprise a single quantum system, and that means _no messing _from the classical world. The two paragraphs refer to the same operations and mathematics, but the second avoids extraneous weirdness.\nThe two most mature methods of actually preparing quantum computers are NMR spectroscopy and ion traps. Ion traps deal with fine control of isolated quantum systems (as required for \u0026ldquo;entanglement\u0026rdquo;) and involves very exotic and incredibly precise experimental apparatus. This is what you would expect if you are dealing with single systems: the expense of dealing with them grows as the size of the separation grows. NMR deals with many systems (coffee cups, for example - the link is to a PDF file) and uses the fancy techniques of pulsed magnetic resonance to give these systems a variety of kicks. It\u0026rsquo;s recently been extended to 12 \u0026ldquo;qubits\u0026rdquo; (individual spins), which is the biggest quantum computer to date.\nBut here is the odd thing, this most successful technique is not based on the single systems that are needed for entanglement. In fact, these same multi-pulse NMR experiments have been carried out for some years and the word \u0026ldquo;entanglement\u0026rdquo; never raised its head so far as I know until the Quantum Computation people got interested. In NMR you are dealing with qubits that are not spatially separated (they are nuclei on the same molecule) and you are not dealing with a single quantum system described by a single state vector (you are dealing with a thermodynamic ensemble of quantum systems described by a density matrix). Myself, I could never follow the theory of multi-pulse NMR, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure there was no mention of many-world interpretations in it.\nSo QC should realise that the consequences of \u0026ldquo;entanglement\u0026rdquo; are limited to inherently exotic systems with which you are unlikely to be able to build a real computer. It\u0026rsquo;s useful in PR material to highlight the weirdness of the quantum world, but when talking science you should follow Occam, who said \u0026ldquo;avoid talking weirdness whenever possible\u0026rdquo;. For example, when QC people talk about \u0026ldquo;maximally entangled states\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Bell states\u0026rdquo; they simply mean a state in which you\u0026rsquo;ve measured spin along one axis when you\u0026rsquo;re going to measure spin along another axis later. This can be talked about without reference to Bell or entanglement.\nThis thing with entanglement shows up in all kinds of popular articles by the practitioners of WC. As one example, here is a popular piece by some of the theorists (Steane and van Dam) who have demonstrated that you can use entanglement to enhance communication - that you can exploit the entanglement of a quantum state together with regular messages among observers at different places to get more efficient communications. The article reads in a fun enough way (it\u0026rsquo;s about participants at a game show who each carry their own little qubit into a separate cubicle and then pass messages). But it\u0026rsquo;s not possible. You can\u0026rsquo;t carry a qubit around because in order to exploit entanglement you have to have a single quantum system. This kind of writing comes from thinking about measurement according to the first way I wrote the paragraph above (measure the particle) as opposed to the second (measure the system).\nPerhaps I\u0026rsquo;m being overly picky about this because it is, after all, just a popular article (although it works in some concepts you would need undergraduate physics to understand before the end). But I can imagine QCers saying, \u0026ldquo;well, it\u0026rsquo;s possible in principle\u0026rdquo;. But like a lot of \u0026ldquo;in principle\u0026rdquo; arguments I don\u0026rsquo;t buy it. I think Daniel Dennett dealt with this kind of argument in his brilliant \u0026ldquo;Consciousness Explained\u0026rdquo; when discussing the idea of a \u0026ldquo;brain in a vat\u0026rdquo; (aka the Matrix) where philosophers argue that you could \u0026ldquo;in principle\u0026rdquo; recreate the sensations of the world by stimulating the right portions of the brain. Dennett basically calls their bluff and accuses them of not thinking through the magnitude of the problem, and takes some time to spell out just how hugely implausible it is. Now it\u0026rsquo;s not a proof, but I think the same kind of thing applies to these popularizations of entanglement. You can \u0026ldquo;in principle\u0026rdquo; have widely separated parts of a single quantum state outside a hugely expensive laboratory only if you don\u0026rsquo;t think too hard about what the endeavour entails. In a sense, we\u0026rsquo;re back to the use of Unitary operators by the theorists so they don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about implementations.\nWell, this has been more rambling than I expected, so here\u0026rsquo;s a summary of what I see as the main points.\n The split between abstract theory and physical implementation in the structure of quantum computing is a dangerous game. It means that everything that quantum computing theory says needs to be taken with a big pinch of salt until realistic quantum computers are demonstrated. The widespread use of the rhetoric of entanglement and other ideas that focus on the non-intuitive parts of quantum mechanics exacerbates the problem by pulling QC theory further away from actual implementations.\n The fact that the biggest quantum computers to date are NMR based demonstrates how little entanglement adds to the actual theory of QC. And the fact that the best alternative is the inherently exotic approach of ion traps is disheartening.\n  I hope I\u0026rsquo;m wrong. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of smart people working on quantum computing who I\u0026rsquo;m sure have thought through these issues more than I have, and they look like in some ways they are making progress (see here). But here are two predictions that will show whether I\u0026rsquo;m right or wrong in a few years. One is that what constitutes a major advance will be redefined. The participants in a field are always enthusiastic about the major advances that are happening, but if we see major experimental advances that are phrased in terms like \u0026ldquo;enhance the understanding of what is necessary for quantum computation\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;actually compute something\u0026rdquo; then watch out. Second, the goals (PDF) set out by some people in the field will not be achieved.\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s my Canadian Thansgiving ramble. Now I\u0026rsquo;m going to plant some tulips, which, with a bit of luck, will appear simultaneously, as if by magic, in a coherent fashion next spring.\n**Update: **A recent post at Shtetl Optimized discusses a paper that has some of the same criticisms as my post here, except done properly: \u0026ldquo;Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? by M.

It\u0026rsquo;s not that Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and so on wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do such a thing - personally I think they\u0026rsquo;d do it in a heartbeat if it gained them a few points in the polls - but that they can\u0026rsquo;t even if they want to. It\u0026rsquo;s getting close to the end of Bush\u0026rsquo;s second term, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the personal clout any more, and Iraq is such a complete and utter catastrophe that the response to any further military adventurism would, I think, be swift and damning. Now this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t reassure me if I was sitting in Tehran, but that\u0026rsquo;s how it looks from here.\nAnd now someone with some actual knowledge says the same thing. The Yorkshire Ranter is someone who seems to know his military logistics stuff, and also comes from God\u0026rsquo;s Own County, so he can hardly be wrong, and he argues that the US just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the needed stuff in the area to carry out any attack on Iran.\nHis recent posts have been excellent - I especially like his unified theory of stupidity on terrorism where he starts off with this:\nI'm beginning to think that it's possible to discern so many similarities between really stupid opinions on terrorism that we can call it a theory. Specifically, _if you're talking about state sponsorship, you're probably wrong, unless overwhelming evidence contradicts this_. As far as I can tell, the modern version of this theory originated in the late 1970s or early 1980s. It had been about - Shakespeare has a character in _Richard II_ allege that \"all the troubles in our lands/have in false Bolingbroke their first head and spring\" - but the strong form seems to have originated then. Key features are that 1) terrorist or guerrilla activity is never the work of the people who appear to carry it out, 2) instead it is the work of a Sponsor, 3) that only action against the Sponsor will be effective, 4) even if there is no obvious sign of the Sponsor's hand, this only demonstrates their malign skill, and 5) there is evidence, but it is too secret to produce.

This is a phenomenon I like to call featuritis.\nAt its simplest, a software product is a set of n independent features (i = 1,\u0026hellip;, n). Each feature has a utility to the customer of ui. The overall utility of the software product to the customer is therefore\nU = Sum( ui )\nThis tells you to keep adding features to the software to increase its utility, end of story. Not very interesting.\nBut software is not quite so simple as this. Each feature has not only a utility, but also a cost \u0026ndash; ci. This is the cost to the end user\u0026mdash;not the developer\u0026mdash;of using or deciding not to use the feature. The cost may include the time taken to find out about a feature, deciding how to use it, whether it is the right feature to use (among the options available), difficulty exploring and evaluating the feature, and so on.\nWith this cost added in, the overall utility of the software product to the end user is\nU = Sum( ui - ci )\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep things really simple, and assume that all features have the same utility (u). We can\u0026rsquo;t do this for the cost though: the cost of using a feature inevitably depends on the total number of features in the product. This may be because it takes longer to find information about a particular feature in the documentation or user interface, or because it is more difficult to decide if this is the right feature to use among those that are present, or a host of other reasons (more on this below). So the cost of finding out about a feature is (c * n).\nThe overall utility of the software is then\nU = Sum( u - c * n )\nor, as all the terms are equal,\nU = n ( u - c * n )\nWhich looks like this:\nThe utility function increases up to a maximum at n = ( u / 2 c ), and then decreases: that is, beyond a certain point, adding new features actually makes the software less useful. In other words, software is vulnerable to featuritis: it can become so complex that its complexity makes it useless. It may contain useful features, but finding these needles in the haystack of the product is frustratingly difficult. Experience tells us that this is a reasonable, if not surprising, result.\nWhat is more, adding features _that are useful in and of themselves _can still introduce featuritis. For a feature to be useful, its utility (u) must be greater than the cost of finding out about it (c * n). So using this model, features will be added to the software until the following condition is met\nn = u / c.\nwhich is where the line crosses the x axis. The maximum utility of the software occurs at half this value (n = u / 2 c): if we continue to add features until the last feature is only just useful, the overall utility of the software will be U = 0. If features were stopped at (u / 2 c), the utility would be U = ( u2 / 4 c ). Even a useful feature degrades the usability of other product features, by making them harder to use (increasing the cost of using them).\nIt follows that checklist driven software development will lead to poor software. Checklists are simply lists of useful features, without any consideration of the costs they introduce to the customer. A longer checklist is often assumed to be intrinsically better than a short checklist, but we have just seen that this may not be so.\nWhat it is about this very simple model that produces these results? The key assumption is that features have independent utilities, but that the costs of using features are not independent. In economists\u0026rsquo; jargon, features exert a negative externality on each other. Is there a reason to think this might be true?\nThe independence of feature utility is simply a matter of defining a feature\nproperly. For example, if a very common scenario requires two \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo; (A and B) then the utility of feature A depends very much on whether feature B is present or not. By itself, the utility of feature A may be very low \u0026ndash; you can\u0026rsquo;t do much with it by itself. Once feature B is present, though, feature A becomes very useful. They are not independent features. The problem here is that \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo; A and B are incomplete, and so are really part of a single properly-defined \u0026ldquo;feature\u0026rdquo;. The model requires that we define features in terms of tasks that customers can carry out. The model does not tell us to implement 5\u0026frasl;6 of a feature and then not implement the last sixth because of complexity worries.\nThe second assumption is that the cost of using a feature is dependent on other product features. The idea of a cost of using a feature is a very general one, and is not only \u0026ldquo;how long does it take to locate this feature in the documentation?\u0026rdquo;. It may also reflect the confusion and uncertainty introduced by a plethora of choices. For example, if there are multiple ways of carrying out a task, the customer must decide which way is the best. If there are other features that appear to be related, the customer must investigate those (and discard them) before deciding on a course of action. If there are prerequisite features that must be understood, the customer must learn these also. They must spend time evaluating the alternatives. It seems reasonable to assume that the cost of wisely using an appropriate feature does depend on the overall complexity (number of features) in the product. The job of user interface designers and documentation teams is, at least in part, to minimize this destructive interference between product features. Good UI and documentation can help postpone the point at which featuritis sets in, but can\u0026rsquo;t hold it back for ever.\nOf course, while simplified models like this might help us watch out for certain kinds of trap, they can\u0026rsquo;t help us decide which specific features to include, and which to discard. Also, there is not much to be gained from trying to pinpoint the particular u and c associated with features or products. Despite the equations, it is a qualitative model and cannot be easily quantified in a useful manner. Finally, while it is certainly true that ui and ci are far from constant in any product, there is probably not a lot to be gained by trying to refine their representation. As soon as models like this are made more complex, the result is a very open-ended and conditional prediction. Building fine software products can\u0026rsquo;t be reduced to equations.\nBut I do think the central ideas are broadly correct: complexity does influences cost and utility in different ways, software does tend to become overly complex. and\u0026mdash;most importantly\u0026mdash;asking \u0026ldquo;is this a useful feature?\u0026rdquo; is not the right way to develop good products.\n","date":1157062581,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"a2f084d583811d49b3a3f85838f85e0a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/software_featur/","publishdate":"2006-08-31T22:16:21Z","relpermalink":"/post/software_featur/","section":"post","summary":"Here is a common-sense approach to software development, which I\u0026rsquo;ll call the checklist approach:\n Propose a new feature.\n Ask if the feature is useful.\n If the feature is useful, implement it.\n  This essay uses shows why the checklist approach fails: why adding useful new features to a software product can make the overall product less useful to end users.

Just put my libel case winnings in my bank account, please!    ...Similarly, we can and probably will automate vast chunks of what is done by lawyers, doctors, politicians, bureaucrats, engineers, computer scientists, and so on. This could lead to a reduction in prices, just as manufactured goods are much cheaper than they used to be. That could be important. For example, now, if you are charged with a crime and have enough money that you are ineligible for government-paid legal assistance, you will likely go broke defending yourself. Ditto if you get involved in a contested divorce settlement. Even handling a real estate transaction costs hundreds or thousands of dollars in legal fees, when most of the work is rote. It would be a social revolution if the cost of getting legal advice became more reasonable.    So was I being unnecessarily grumpy or just necessarily grumpy?\nWell, probably yes a bit of both. The picture that Yappa paints is definitely cool. Right now justice is, as someone once said, open to everyone in the same way as the Ritz Hotel, so making legal help cheaper is going to help a lot of people. For example, JS showed me this thing called Eulalyzer which \u0026ldquo;reads\u0026rdquo; those pesky end-user licence agreements and, well, let\u0026rsquo;s let it speak for itself\u0026hellip;\nEULAlyzer can analyze license agreements in seconds, and provide a detailed listing of potentially interesting words and phrases. Discover if the software you're about to install displays pop-up ads, transmits personally identifiable information, uses unique identifiers to track you, or much much more.    This is a Good Thing, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are lots of other ways that software could lower efforts and costs, especially routine documentation checks, like real estate transactions and so on. Why pay lawyer rates for a person to read through these routine documents when software could go through them and flag any unusual text. Great.\nBut the down side remains. There are two parts to most legal exchanges - one side prepares a document and delivers it; the other side reads it and responds. While low cost makes it easier to do the reading and responding, it makes the preparation easier as well. And more than anything, it makes the delivery easy - and this is where the problem really lies: there is a prospect of spamlike legal threats, warnings, and so on because they can take advantage of the cheap production of documents and then multiply that cheapness (if that\u0026rsquo;s the right phrase) to scatter them widely.\nWhat we really want, of course, is the one without the other. E-mail without the spam; downloads without viruses, networks without trojans. Not a lot of chance of that, but perhaps we can minimize the downside of some of the new developments if decide that spam legal threats are invalid.\n","date":1156806156,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"08bc34bdc881b98844b029eb7a118f22","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/lawyerbots_agai/","publishdate":"2006-08-28T23:02:36Z","relpermalink":"/post/lawyerbots_agai/","section":"post","summary":"Yappa Ding Ding wrote a lively post about automating intellectual jobs in response to my gripes about lawyerbots.

There are benefits to both approaches. Take the study of solid state electronic and magnetic properties, where the early work of physicists was to compute, using very sophisticated techniques, the properties of highly simplified models such as a free-electron gas with a uniform background of positive charge. Chemists, on the other hand, were busy studying complex materials with intricate structures, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have the theory to do more than classify the kind of observations they made. As a result, physicists gave theories for superconductivity and other exotic phenomena, but because their theories had so little information about the specifics of molecular structure they couldn\u0026rsquo;t predict the kind of material where superconductivity would be found. The discovery of high-temperature superconductors in the 1980\u0026rsquo;s had physicists as well as chemists scratching their heads. The empiricism of chemistry (where theorists form about 10% of the population) compared to physics (where the number is, I think, more like 30%) forces theoretical chemists to deal with the messy and specific problems that their discipline\u0026rsquo;s vast body of observation and experiment demands.\nEconomists are to sociologists as physicists are to chemists. Whenever you see a discussion of scientific method and rigour in the social sciences, the comparison is always made to physics. This is not surprising, because physics remains the archetypal science, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing because the social sciences \u0026ndash; like chemistry \u0026ndash; have to stay grounded in the empirical side of what they study. The details of any particular problem are so often crucial to the outcome that you can\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;the light touch of the physicist\u0026rdquo; and expect to come out with predictions. It\u0026rsquo;s all very well to talk in the abstract of markets, but when reality hits it\u0026rsquo;s the details that often matter. Sociologists spend their lives looking at those details, like chemists they tease out conclusions from the structure and dynamics of particular circumstances and events. And like chemists, they get less respect than their more formal, more model-driven, and less empirical siblings.\nThese different proclivities are on show when sociologist Kieran Healy looks at blood and organ donation in his new book Last Best Gifts and when economists Gary Becker and Julio Elias look at organ donations in their widely discussed working paper, and my ex-chemist self is glad to say that Healy comes out looking better.\nThe basic problem is simple. Advances in surgery and in immuno-suppressing drugs have made organ transplants safer and cheaper since the 1980\u0026rsquo;s. The number of organ donors (whether live or dead) has grown, but not nearly enough to keep up with the demand, and the result is a growing shortage of organs. People who could be saved are dying while waiting for \u0026ldquo;donor\u0026rdquo; organs. What can be done?\nBecker takes, as anyone who has read any of his writings would expect, a forthright and straightforward approach. Shortages mean that supply and demand don\u0026rsquo;t match. As he says in a blog essay on this issue:\nTo an economist, the major reason for the imbalance between demand and supply of organs is that the United States and practically all other countries forbid the purchase and sale of organs. This means that under present laws, people give their organs to be used after they die, or with kidneys and livers also while they are alive, only out of altruism and similar motives. In fact, practically all transplants of kidneys and livers with live donors are from one family member to another member. With live liver transplants, only a portion of the liver of a donor is use, and this grows over time in the donee, while the remaining portion regenerates over time in the donor.     If laws were changed so that organs could be purchased and sold, some people would give not out of altruism, but for the financial gain. The result would be an increased supply of organs. In a free market, the prices of organs for transplants would settle at the levels that would eliminate the excess demand for each type of organ.    You make supply match demand by introducing a market \u0026ndash; paying people for their organs (eg, kidneys) or for the organs of their family members after death \u0026ndash; because that\u0026rsquo;s what markets do. So he and Elias do some rough calculations on what would be needed ($32,000 per liver, while the current cost of a liver transplant is $175,000), and say \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s do it\u0026rdquo;. Becker is under no illusion that this proposal will be adopted soon, but believes that there is a real chance that it may be taken increasingly seriously over the coming years, and serious discussions are increasingly (so I\u0026rsquo;m told) including markets as possibilities, as in a recent issue of Kidney International.\nThere are no details in Becker and Elias\u0026rsquo;s sketch of the form that the market would take. Of course, Becker is aware of many of the arguments against markets (many coming from Richard Titmuss\u0026rsquo;s influential 1971 book The Gift Relationship) and returns to them in his later blog posting to address them: that \u0026ldquo;commodification\u0026rdquo; of body parts is immoral; that payment may drive out altruistic donations and so not yield the bumper crop he predicts; that organs may be removed mainly from the poor and installed mainly in the rich; that organs may be removed forcefully from people (as Falun Gong supporters are claiming is happening in China now) in order to be sold; that people may regret an impulsive and irreversible decision to sell; that payment may lead to people lying about their medical health and so lead to infected organs entering the system. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t so much argue these issues as dismiss them. Tellingly, he uses the passive voice: the quality of blood \u0026ldquo;can be maintained at a high level\u0026rdquo;, the source of organs \u0026ldquo;could be determined in most cases without great difficulty\u0026rdquo;; the number of impulsive donors \u0026ldquo;could be sharply reduced by having a month or longer cooling off waiting period\u0026rdquo;. It isn\u0026rsquo;t quite clear who has the incentive to maintain all these standards, or carry out these checks, or how much it would cost to persuade someone to do so. And yet in markets for experience goods (and organs, surely, are experience goods of a visceral kind) information issues are at the heart of the problem. The cavalier brushing aside of issues of trust, fair dealing, and asymmetric information makes Becker\u0026rsquo;s case unconvincing to this reader.\nBecker also commits what Tyler Cowen of Marginal Revolution calls the libertarian vice: assuming that the quality of government is fixed. In this case, that means assuming that if altruism isn\u0026rsquo;t working now, then it won\u0026rsquo;t work in the future. \u0026ldquo;If altruism were sufficiently powerful, the supply of organs would be large enough to satisfy demand, and there would be no need to change the present system. But this is not the case\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nKieran Healy spends most of Last Best Gifts exploring the very things that Becker skates over so casually, and argues that they are the heart of the matter. Altruism is not a fixed quantity, but depends crucially on \u0026ldquo;the cultural contexts and organizational mechanisms that provide people with reasons and opportunities to give\u0026rdquo; (p2). Those unspecified actors who are the passive voices of Becker\u0026rsquo;s arguments are, Healy argues, the key to success or failure when it comes to blood and organ donation. For example, organ donation from the newly dead is, in practice, dependent on approval from the relatives and the rate of approval depends in turn, it turns out, on who asks them. If the person who is helping them come to turns with the death is the one who asks them to approve donation of the organs, they are more likely to refuse than if somebody else (even from the same organization) asks them. Establishing protocols and practices, managing logistics, establishing trust \u0026ndash; all these matter. It is, Healy is arguing, not useful to talk about the issue or organ transplants without addressing the specifics of questions such as whether relatives of dead organ donors have the right to meet the recipient (as justone example), because these are the kind of decisions that can have big consequences.\nThe book is academically written, with all the costs and benefits that implies. It was originally a PhD thesis, so unsurprisingly it favours logic and cautious language over passion, footnotes everything, and tends to wrap conclusions in qualifiers. The empirical middle chapters in particular (3 and 4) are a bit dry. But the book is an important contribution; it identifies a whole range of important issues when it comes to organ donation, and may move the debate away from the market/altruism dichotomy to a more nuanced and realistic debate over coping with large-scale enterprises. That would be valuable. I definitely recommend it if you want to learn about the issues involved, and want some ideas for healthy ways forward.\n(A minor quibble before moving on. He discusses the US and a bunch of European countries, but not Canada. This is common in American/European comparisons \u0026ndash; The Economist seems prone to it \u0026ndash; but it is still irritating to this Anglo-Canadian reader.)\nHealy looks at both the blood system and the organ system, and his analysis of the failure of the blood system in the US and in Europe to handle HIV and Hepatitis C infection makes his reality-based approach uncomfortable reading for market enthusiasts and market sceptics alike. In some cases, the market-based blood plasma system in the US did better than the donation-based mainstream blood system in responding to the potential for infection, even as both sets of organizations had the same information at the same time. That they too failed at the hurdle of throwing out blood plasma that was already taken is no comfort. In fact, one of the more interesting conclusions that Healy seems to come to is that there may be dependencies among the different parts of the system (the collection agency, the donors, the recipients, the hospitals) that are more important than the presence of absence of payment in the determination of success or failure. The issue may be more one of industrialization of the system than the commodification of organs. This makes sense, once he points it out, because any market-based approach is going to involve local monopsonies and a few big players in any given region. There\u0026rsquo;s not going to be a whole lot of competition going on among agencies, offering higher and lower prices for kidneys, and so the outcome will depend on the detailed interactions that take place. And if the shortage is to be tackled (there were 50,000 people on the waiting list for kidneys in the USA in 2000) then this is going to be a large-scale, industrial effort whether or not payment is made to \u0026ldquo;donors\u0026rdquo; or not. Money will be involved because big organizations - private industry or not - have lots of money flowing through them. People will make or break their careers based on what decisions are to be made, and as the HIV/hepatitis case proved, a public or not-for-profit agency is no proof against tragedy.\nMuch of the discussion is handled in terms of literature on the \u0026ldquo;gift relationship\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I know much about (the literature, not the relationship, although I am a bit cheap), but it seems to handle what sociology is best at. There are layers of meaning that influence our decisions and attitudes to issues such as organ transplants. Healy reminds us that life insurance was once a controversial industry, with its connotations of payment for death, that had to overcome cultural resistance and find ways to stake a position that is both morally acceptable and profitable. The life insurance industry was, of course, one of the last havens of large-scale mutual co-operative organizations, and in some countries the movement away from that model to a shareholder model is one that has not yet played out. But I digress.\nThe nature of the gift relationship is subtle. If payment is made to a funeral home rather than directly to family members, then does that mean the organs of a just-deceased loved one have been donated (with an acknowledgement made in honour of the gesture) or have the family been paid? If a live kidney donor is compensated for their time and discomfort, but not for their kidney, have they been paid? There are more subtleties in the book, both involving payment and not. It seems that we all agree that organ donation is good in the abstract, but not so much when it comes to the crunch. Attempts to narrow this gap between abstract approval and on-the-spot reluctance may be seen as delicate and considerate diplomacy, or may be seen as cynical manipulation (Healy compares parts of the process to the con-man\u0026rsquo;s efforts to \u0026ldquo;cool the mark\u0026rdquo; meaning to make the object of a scam accept his/her position as loser in a resigned manner rather than in anger, so that they don\u0026rsquo;t report it to the authorities).\nMy guess is that the systems developed in different countries will involve some forms of payment but will steer clear of the obvious payment that Becker appears to advocate. Any agency, public or private, will have to be monitored (oops - there\u0026rsquo;s that passive voice), and that monitoring will cost money. Issues like deciding on how to determine death (and debates are going on about this now, of course) are vulnerable to all kinds of incentives I\u0026rsquo;d rather not think about; but someone has to, and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be someone with a direct monetary stake in the outcome.\nHealy convinced me that the big issue is not the economists\u0026rsquo; issue \u0026ndash; of markets versus altruism \u0026ndash; but is the sociologists\u0026rsquo; issue of coping with complex incentives in large-scale industrial organizations, and that alone was worth the price of the book.

So there is something of a void.\n\u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s the book doing?\u0026rdquo; people ask, and while (on the advice of LS) I usually respond optimistically, the truth is I have no idea. What, anyway, would be good and what would be bad? I mean, being invited on the Daily Show or appearing on the New York Times bestseller list would be unambiguously good, but below that it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of what my expectations are. Is 1,000 copies good? 10,000? Who is to say? And as it\u0026rsquo;s my first time around at this particular game, I have no expectations whatsoever. So LS is right in her advice: the optimistic response is better than the blank stare and shrug of the shoulders that I would otherwise give.\nIn this void of information, any and all scraps are welcome to the starved author. The internet, of course, is a vast source of entrails and tea leaves that have to be prodded, scried (?) and stirred to reveal their Nostradamus-clear prophecies. But something is better than nothing so, data addict that I am, I autogoogle and troll for all those scraps it provides.\nHere, then, are some of the nicer-smelling entrails I have found so far (in addition to those I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned earlier in this weblog).\nThat someone would pick up your book and read it is a great compliment. If they reach the end, more so. If they actually put finger to keyboard to say something about it, then that\u0026rsquo;s very heartwarming indeed. I\u0026rsquo;ve got lots of great feedback from friends, but there is of course every reason for the sceptical author to suspect these people of gilding the lilly a bit when they tell me what a fine book it is. Not that I\u0026rsquo;m ungrateful, you understand - far from it. Bring on those compliments! I just reserve my judgement sometimes.\nSo particular thanks goes to people I don\u0026rsquo;t know. People like Persephone, who wrote this in answer to one of those book Q\u0026amp;A topics that go around the weblogs.\n8. **One book you are currently reading?**     _No-One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart_ by Tom Slee. Well, actually I finished it a while ago, but I'm still paging through it thinking about the arguments he presents. It's very provocative. Out of all these books, read that one first.    I can tell you, that makes great reading. Thanks a million Persephone - you are indeed a sage. Other recent weblog mentions include the Relentlessly Progressive Economics blog and the Danish Observations and Stories, who both reproduce a bit from my online excerpt. Thanks to both of them.\nThen there are people who use the title for their own purposes. Kerry Howley is assistant editor of Reason Online, the libertarian-capitalist online magazine. Her article \u0026ldquo;Has Wal-Mart Peaked?\u0026rdquo; argues that Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s recent setbacks in Germany and Korea may be a harbinger of troubles to come for the beast of Bentonville, and that those who fear Wal-Mart may therefore be worrying without reason.  She says\u0026hellip;\nThe fear Wal-Mart inspires is nicely encapsulated in the title of Tom Slee's recent book [_No One Makes You Shop At Wal-Mart: The Deception of Personal Choice._](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=189707106X%20/ref=nosim/reasonmagazineA/) Slee argues that Wal-Mart is a scourge we bring upon ourselves by forsaking the good of the community for the false idol of individual choice. But it was the individual choices of individual consumers in Germany and South Korea that sent Wal-Mart packing.    I don\u0026rsquo;t actually disagree with her on this. Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s global dominance is certainly not a foregone conclusion, as (among others) the Guardian recently mentioned its less-than-stellar progress with Asda in the UK, speculating that Wal-Mart may be too American to succeed globally. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that weakens my book, mind you.\nAnother libertarian who has (more deliberately) helped to promote the book is the open-minded Alex Tabarrok of Marginal Revolution, who said this in a recent post about a story I pointed him to.\nThanks to Tom Slee for the pointer. I hope to say more about his interesting new book,[ No one Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart](http://www.web.net/%7Etslee/), in the future. Contrary to the title it's about how markets fail, not a defense of Wal-Mart!    Whether or not he does say more (and I hope he does, of course, but hey, he\u0026rsquo;s a busy guy), here is the effect on my main web site of that one little mention (click for a clearer image).\n\nOf course, I track my sales on amazon.com (I haven\u0026rsquo;t been tracking them on .ca and .co.uk yet, but there\u0026rsquo;s time for that to start.) During August my ranking has been bouncing around between 60,000 and 300,000 (probably 60,000 means someone has bought a copy, and 300,000 means no one has bought one for a while). Here is what the graph looks like (from my Zohosheet); a low point is a good thing. Not very legible I fear, but this is about as clear as I can make it - right click and choose View Image to see it more clearly.\nAnother fine thing is that you get to mix with eminent neighbours. I get a kick out of looking in bookstores and libraries at who is next to me on the shelves. At a local store, philosopher Peter Singer (The Way We Eat) of Animal Liberation fame is my neighbour. At the local library, Anthony Giddens (Runaway World) is right next door. In the online list of Working for Change resources at the University of Victoria I\u0026rsquo;m hanging out with Vandana Shiva, author of Biopiracy. This is all pretty cool.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s about it I think. Or wait, maybe someone has mentioned the book in the last twenty minutes. Wait a sec, I\u0026rsquo;ll just check google again\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nNo? Oh well. Maybe again\u0026hellip;.\n**Update: **apparently if you can write about sex with some panache, then going to the book store is far more rewarding (not safe for work!).

The theme is \u0026ldquo;Stars, Deaths and Disasters, 1962–1964\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s the Deaths part that is most obvious, and which Cronenberg has most to say about on the commentary. Given that Warhol produced so much stuff the focus on death, particularly grisly death (as in the electric chair series and the Car Crash series) and disaster does seem to have more to do with Cronenberg\u0026rsquo;s interests than with Warhol\u0026rsquo;s.\nI went not knowing much about Warhol beyond Campbell Soup, Velvet Underground, and the odd profile of him I\u0026rsquo;d seen. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether I would be impressed or not - I don\u0026rsquo;t have knee jerk reactions for or against modern art. On the plus side, I like being challenged by art - anything that makes you take a different look at a piece of the world deserves praise, whether you agree with it or not - and on the negative side, I don\u0026rsquo;t have much time for sensationalism for the sake of it. But how to tell the difference?\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad I saw the exhibition, and some of the things I really liked (the Elvis image, for example) but overall I ended up with a lower opinion of Warhol than when I went in.\nThe films were the least impressive part of the exhibition. (\u0026ldquo;Blow Job\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Sleep\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Couch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Screen Tests\u0026rdquo;, and something about a haircut) There is always something about yesterday\u0026rsquo;s iconoclasts that is a little pathetic, because the most outrageous things tend to look tamer over time (well, except for Un Chien Andalou perhaps). Most people go through a phase of self-discovery and exploration of our place in the world, some with more gusto than others. But most of us don\u0026rsquo;t call it ground-breaking art and I didn\u0026rsquo;t see much in the films beyond a desire to shock and a desire to self promote. The expressions on some of the models/participants/actors were just \u0026ldquo;hey, look at us, aren\u0026rsquo;t we something\u0026rdquo; and I thought - \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;. The films seemed to catch the worst of what the Warhol phenomenon is about: the circular reasoning behind the fame and celebrity that he seemed to pursue so relentlessly. Warhol is important in part because of the subjects of his art (Jackie O, Liz Taylor, Marilyn Monroe); but in some cases the subjects take on their importance only because it was Warhol who pointed his camera at them: Warhol, in the end, is important only because he is Warhol. The insights that the commentary gives into his apparent shyness, his pursuit of celebrity, and his devotion to celebrity are creepy. There is a touch of the Paris Hilton here - famous for being famous. And if Warhol, you say, is deeper than Paris Hilton, then he would disagree - one wall had his epigram on it: \u0026ldquo;If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing behind it.\u0026rdquo; The two of them share something in common.\nThe silk-screen images were more interesting, and occasionally more disturbing. The best \u0026ndash; the electric chair series (can\u0026rsquo;t remember their real name) and some of the Liz Taylor series, and the famous Elvis Presley images, use the repetitive silk-screen technique to fine effect, with the sequence of images fading away, or collapsing on themselves, giving a poignant and melancholy air to the whole image. Others, such as Race Riot and Car Crash, disturbed me for different reasons. Where the commentary argued that Warhol forces us to look in a different way at the images, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I just saw them as a self-promotional artist taking others\u0026rsquo; grief and distress and making himself famous from it. His own distance from his subject did not have the effect on me that it had on Cronenberg. He found the distancing effect of silkscreen, the coldness of the technique, to demand a new scrutiny of the image. I had no such reaction - to me Warhol\u0026rsquo;s recycling of these images as art had little impact.\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad I went, if only to see the iconic Presley image at full size and in the silk-screened flesh - starting tall and bold, and fading away into a dim greyness over time, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult not to see it as prophecy. But I can\u0026rsquo;t take Warhol seriously as a major artist. The fact that his reputation has grown since his death is, I suspect, mainly a result of his contemporaries bringing sentimental memories of the their youth into the now top-of-the-field positions that they occupy.\n","date":1156450925,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"860de9b8e4e5cc7f16bb7835332635eb","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/andy_warhol_sup/","publishdate":"2006-08-24T20:22:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/andy_warhol_sup/","section":"post","summary":"Went into Toronto today, and took a look at the Andy Warhol exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario, \u0026ldquo;guest curated\u0026rdquo; by David Cronenberg.\nTalking to AK beforehand, she said that the show is as much about Cronenberg as it is about Warhol, and I see what she means.

The trouble is that there is no such thing as \u0026ldquo;low price, by itself\u0026rdquo;. Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s low prices are unavoidably one side of a two-sided coin. Wal-Mart knows how to push its costs onto others so that the prices on their shelves stay low: how to buy land cheap and still get subsidies from cities, how to pay so little that employees in many US states rely on government programs for health care and food stamps, how to squeeze suppliers so that they have to export jobs, and so on. Wal-Mart offers us a bargain, and as with any bargain we have to ask ourselves \u0026ldquo;is it worth it?\u0026rdquo;\nThe fact that over 100 million North Americans each week shop at Wal-Mart suggests that we like the one side of the coin. But this huge number does not mean that we have decided in some cumulative sense that the bargain is worth it: we have not voted in favour of low costs even at the cost to the health of other parts of our cities, and at the cost of abused workers both in poor nations and in North America. The free market is often portrayed as a continual exercise in democracy, with our purchases as votes, but that\u0026rsquo;s not how it works.\nThe reason is that most of us have only one direct relationship to Wal-Mart, and that is as consumers. As a result, Wal-Mart only responds to our consumption wishes. But as Robert Reich wrote a year ago during a debate over Wal-Mart coming to New York, we are not just consumers but are also workers and citizens. \u0026ldquo;New Yorkers, like most other Americans, want the great deals that canbe had in a rapidly globalizing high-tech economy. Yet the prices onsales tags don\u0026rsquo;t reflect the full prices we have to pay as workers andcitizens.\u0026rdquo;\nOur consumer choices are determined by those sales tags. But whether we like it or not, our consumer choices end up affecting other things too, in a minuscule way. They affect the shape of our cities, the wages that those who provide the goods pay their employees, and so on. Our own individual contribution makes almost no difference to any of these things, which is why we tend to ignore them when we make our decisions of what to buy and where to buy it. There is nothing that we can do as individual consumers to make a difference to any of these things. But multiply by 100 million and those little contributions add up. All those ignored side-effects become a big factor in our lives, and their costs can overwhelm any benefit we get from our consumption. If we trust our consumer decisions to shape our world, we inevitably end up with a world that undervalues those other parts of our lives. The private benefits of consumption drive out the shared benefits of other parts of our lives.\nThis is one reason why John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books (August 7, 2006) that \u0026ldquo;Ethical consumption may indeed be the best we can do, and it gives theethical consumer a nice warm glow, but it is also another form ofself-expression through consumption, and it is consumption, at root,which is the problem.\u0026rdquo; Not that we need to stop consuming, but that our consumer decisions should not shape our whole world. Lanchester goes on to argue that \u0026ldquo;The case of Wal-Mart makes us realise just how badly we lack a way oftalking about the public good that is not framed purely in terms of economics. The huge fortunes made at the end of the 19th and start ofthe 20th centuries were broken up by anti-monopoly and anti-cartel legislation, because they had been accumulated at the expense of the public good. That is a useful idea, and one that needs to be revivedand used as a yardstick. In its absence, the only ways of talking about Wal-Mart we have are through economics, which offers clear figures (sometimes) whose meanings are murky; or through local protests and objections; or through considering our own ethics as consumers. That, Iwould say, is not enough.\u0026rdquo;\nLanchester and Reich both highlight the fact that free market economies won\u0026rsquo;t deliver those things that we can\u0026rsquo;t choose in a consumer kind of way. \u0026ldquo;The welfare state, free universal healthcare, paid holidays, workers’ benefits of all kinds\u0026rdquo; - those things did not come about by making wise consumer choices. The same goes for healthy cities, a clean environment, and a fair distribution of income. And all those things will go by the way if we trust consumption decisions to direct our society. The way Reich says it is \u0026ldquo;The only way for the workers or citizens in us to trump the consumersin us is through laws and regulations that make our purchases a social choice as well as a personal one. A requirement that companies withmore than 50 employees offer their workers affordable health insurance, for example, might increase slightly the price of their goods and services. My inner consumer won\u0026rsquo;t like that very much, but the worker in me thinks it a fair price to pay. Same with an increase in the minimum wage or a change in labor laws making it easier for employees to organize and negotiate better terms.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is for these reasons that citizens who take a stand against Wal-Mart coming to town have my support. It\u0026rsquo;s time to reclaim some space for the non-consumer parts of ourselves.\n","date":1154980300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"dd2745f3b4ce610d95e449c73b5f1f98","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_walmart_bar/","publishdate":"2006-08-07T19:51:40Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_walmart_bar/","section":"post","summary":"John Lanchester, \u0026ldquo;The Price of Pickles\u0026rdquo;, London Review of Books, vol. 28, No. 1, 22 June 2006. — Link.\nRobert Reich, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Blame Wal-Mart\u0026rdquo;, New York Times, February 28, 2005. — Link.\nThe good thing about Wal-Mart stores is well-known, simple, and can be stated in three of the company\u0026rsquo;s own words: Always Low Prices.

Paradoxically, this also means that significant sectors of the population are rendered immobile. Those who don't own cars, or who are too young or old to drive, have no alternative means of transportation. Automobile dependency also acts as a social centrifuge, segregating land use and socio-economic groupings into discernibly distinct areas. Indeed, urban poverty is now centred in suburban growth, where it is largely invisible, distant from inaccessible, but desperately needed jobs, social services and retail facilities. The rioting in Paris suburbs is an instance of the results of this festering, but unrecognized, problem.     ... Retail concentration in shopping malls does little to encourage small, start-up enterprises that the more mixed and individually owned Main Streets foster.     Most significantly, the cost of providing services to such areas exceeds the tax revenue derived from low-density development. In an analysis of one such area in Southwestern Ontario, it was found that for every dollar received in real-estate tax, $1.40 was needed to service such low-density development.     This form of urban development has been made possible, and indeed encouraged, by ... what amounts to subsidies that land speculators and low-density developers receive from provincial and federal governments in the form of highway construction, and the provision of trunk-line sewers, water supply and other services. The burden of this cost is not borne by the beneficiaries, but by all taxpayers.   So, what can be done to change current development trends? And will those who have the power to initiate such change do so before it is too late?     The means to make these changes is first to institute full-cost pricing. Let the market forces exert their logic: If each increment of suburban growth were to bear the full unit-cost of expressways, trunk water supply and other services, the market would adjust to more appropriate urban forms. That this would create densities capable of supporting public transit, creating a richer mix of land uses, would be an added benefit to affordable development.     Nowadays, development occurs at the extremes of density — either vast expanses of single or semi-detached housing (and low-density commercial uses), or high rise/high density condominiums. There is a wide variety of satisfying housing in between these two extremes, from town houses and duplex dwelling to low-rise apartment buildings of about six to eight storeys. Ingenuity, when confronted with necessity, will out.   _A.J. Diamond is a principal of Diamond and Schmitt Architects Inc.

From Sunday\u0026rsquo;s Winnipeg Free Press:\n**A different take on consumer power**     _Sunday, July 30th, 2006. Reviewed by Lindsey Wiebe_     'WE make choices every day,\" writes Ontario author Tom Slee. \"We choose the clothes we wear, the way we travel, the movies we watch, and the places we shop.\"     But even with all this choice, Slee says, the rich are getting richer, while the middle class and poor are losing ground.     \"What has gone wrong?\" he asks in this thought-provoking mix of academic and social critique.     \"Why is it that with more choices than any in society in history, we do not get what we want?\"     These basic questions form the underpinnings of this first book by the Waterloo software professional and researcher.     In it, Slee explores the pitfalls of a free-market economy; in particular, what he refers to as \"MarketThink,\" the idea that consumers control the market, and can hold corporations accountable.     Slee does his best to debunk this mindset, arguing that even the most reasonable of individual decisions can produce negative results for the general public.     Much of the book revolves around the fictional foibles of Jack and Jill, who live in the made-up town of Whimsley.     Slee uses the characters to illustrate the routine conflicts between personal and public gain.     Should Jack support a downtown department store, or visit a newly opened big-box development? And does it really matter if Jill leaves litter in a public park, when surely others will be more environmentally conscious?     No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart also draws on real-world examples of difficult choices, tackling everything from the issue of herd mentality to the problem of \"free-riders,\" those who act in their own best interests while assuming, often mistakenly, that others will work for the public good.     Slee's reasoning is persuasive, and his examples numerous and far-reaching: the contentious subject of international pollution credits, for one, or the perennial public vs. private school debate.     But although No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart is more accessible than the average academic text, it still falls short of mass-market appeal, and those unfamiliar with game theory might find some sections slower than others.     Slee's pacing is often sluggish, and the overall arrangement of material feels unfocused. The sheer number of examples to deconstruct is also a little daunting, an ironic flaw in a book about the dilemmas of choice.     Slee may have been better off focusing on fewer but more detailed examples to plead his case.     On the positive side, Slee's in-text citations are clear and easy to follow, and readers hoping to learn more about the complexities of decision-making will come out with a solid list of followup books.     No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart doesn't qualify as light summer reading. However, the book does offer an intriguing critique of dominant ideas on consumer power, and puts forward a valid argument for the benefits of collective decision-making and regulation.     _Lindsey Wiebe is a Free Press reporter._       ","date":1154337731,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"1e6c757780a00e400e47e2e182d2dcaa","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/book_review_in_/","publishdate":"2006-07-31T09:22:11Z","relpermalink":"/post/book_review_in_/","section":"post","summary":"Thanks to MC for letting me know about this.

Every now and then they update their figures, and recently they published an updated set that described what happened to American Inequality in 2004. There has been a rush of comments about the numbers on some economic weblogs. So I\u0026rsquo;ll collect them together here - I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to add myself: it\u0026rsquo;s fascinating to see this kind of real-world issue being debated among experts in public.\nFirst, the update itself is in an Excel spreadsheet here, at the web site of Emmanual Saez.\nPaul Krugman (in the New York Times, but reposted in part by Mark Thoma here) describes the main feature as follows:\nThomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, whose long-term estimates of income equality have become the gold standard for research on this topic ... show that even if you exclude capital gains from a rising stock market, in 2004 the real income of the richest 1 percent of Americans surged by almost 12.5 percent. Meanwhile, the average real income of the bottom 99 percent of the population rose only 1.5 percent. In other words, a relative handful of people received most of the benefits of growth.     There are a couple of additional revelations in the 2004 data. One is that growth didn’t just bypass the poor and the lower middle class, it bypassed the upper middle class too. Even people at the 95th percentile of the income distribution — that is, people richer than 19 out of 20 Americans — gained only modestly. ...     The other revelation is that being highly educated was no guarantee of sharing in the benefits of economic growth. There’s a persistent myth, perpetuated by economists who should know better ... that rising inequality ... is mainly a matter of a rising gap between those with a lot of education and those without. But census data show that the real earnings of the typical college graduate actually fell in 2004.    Greg Mankiw, another prominent economist who was also high up in the Bush administration until recently, saw things differently here:\nHere is what I see: After rising substantially from 1986 to 2000, income inequality is essentially the same in 2004 (the most recent year of data) as it was in 2000.    In a separate post, Mankiw also challenges Krugman\u0026rsquo;s sentence about \u0026ldquo;a persistent myth, perpetuated by eonomists who should know better\u0026hellip;that rising inequality\u0026hellip;is mainly a matter of a rising gap between those with a lof of education and those without\u0026rdquo;. While Krugman claims that the big story is the growth of income at the very top of the scale, Mankiw reasserts the role of a more broadly based change:\nMy understanding is that there is a widespread consensus that the returns to education have risen substantially over the past few decades. But the education wage premium is not the whole story, as wage inequality within education categories has also increased substantially.     ...part of the increase in inequality is measurement error, and part of the increase is attributable to the fact that the labor force is older and more educated--characteristics that are associated with higher residual variance.    Brad DeLong takes up the thread, weighing in on Krugman\u0026rsquo;s side:\nThe big rise in inequality in the U.S. since 1980 has been overwhelmingly concentrated among the top 1% of income earners: their share has risen from 8% in 1980 to 16% in 2004. By contrast, the share of the next 4% of income earners has only risen from 13% to 15%, and the share of the next 5% of income earners has stuck at 12%. The top 1% have gone from 8 to 16 times average income, the next 4% have gone from 3.2 to 3.7 times average income, and the next 5% have been stuck at 3 times average income.    It's hard to attribute this pattern to a rise in the premium salary earned by the well-educated by virtue of the skills their formal education taught them.    But Greg Mankiw is not convinced:\nI would guess that the top 1 percent of income earners (those earning more than $276,945) are disproportionately very well educated--doctors, lawyers, MBAs, etc. So the rise in the income of the top 1 percent could well represent in large part a higher education premium.    What might well be true is that the returns to education have become increasingly non-linear: The most educated are now getting a bigger return from a marginal year of education than those with moderate amounts of education. In other words, two years getting an MBA from Harvard Business School may increase a person's income more in percentage terms than does two years getting an Associate Degree from Mass Bay Community College. My understanding from my labor economist friends is that some evidence favors this hypothesis of increasing nonlinearity.    And Mark Thoma adds his two cents:\nWe can debate what has happened the last few years and whether this year or that year had special circumstances such as the problems Brad notes with using 2000 as a base year. But in doing so, we shouldn't lose sight of the overall upward trend in inequality.     **Top Decile Income Share**     [![Fig371506_1](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/images/fig371506_1.gif)](http://whimsley.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/fig371506_1.gif)     **Top 0.01% Income Share**     [![Figa171506_1](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/images/figa171506_1.gif)](http://whimsley.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/figa171506_1.gif)     **Average Real Income of bottom 99% and top 1%**     [![Fig171506](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/images/fig171506.gif)](http://whimsley.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/fig171506.gif)     The little dip at the end is what the fuss is all about. But even if Greg's claim holds up to the types of qualifications Brad talks about, and there are good reasons to worry about using 2000 as a base year, the upward trend in income inequality since the 1970s is undeniable. And in any case, as the last graph shows, real income for the bottom 99% of the distribution has been flat since the early 1970s despite large gains in productivity.    Meanwhile, in keeping with Thoma\u0026rsquo;s theme of focusing on the bigger picture, Brad Delong reminds us that\nReal wages for low-paid workers aren't rising at all. It's not the well-paid benefit \"most.\" It's that only the well-paid are, as a group, benefitting at all.

Here are a few excerpts, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth reading the whole thing:\nThat no one can know whether a film will hit or miss has been an uncomfortable suspicion in Hollywood at least since novelist and screenwriter William Goldman enunciated it in his classic 1983 book \"Adventures in the Screen Trade.\" If Goldman is right and a future film's performance is unpredictable, then there is no way studio executives or producers, despite all their swagger, can have a better track record at choosing projects than an ape throwing darts at a dartboard.     That's a bold statement, but these days it is hardly conjecture: With each passing year the unpredictability of film revenue is supported by more and more academic research...     What the research shows is that even the most professionally made films are subject to many unpredictable factors that arise during production and marketing, not to mention the inscrutable taste of the audience. It is these unknowns that obliterate the ability to foretell the box-office future.     But if picking films is like randomly tossing darts, why do some people hit the bull's-eye more often than others? For the same reason that in a group of apes tossing darts, some apes will do better than others. The answer has nothing to do with skill. Even random events occur in clusters and streaks.     Imagine this game: We line up 20,000 moviegoers who, one by one, flip a coin. If the coin lands heads, they see \"X-Men\"; if the coin lands tails, it's \"The Da Vinci Code.\" Since the coin has an equal chance of coming up either way, you might think that in this experimental box-office war each film should be in the lead about 10,000 times. But the mathematics of randomness says otherwise: The most probable number of lead changes is zero, and it is 88 times more probable that one of the two films will lead through all 20,000 customers than that each film leads 10,000 times. The lesson I teach in my course is that the fairness of the goddess of fortune is expressed not in alternations of the lead but in the symmetry of probabilities: Each film is equally likely to be the one that grabs and keeps the lead.     If the mathematics is counterintuitive, reality is even worse, because a funny thing happens when a random process such as the coin-flipping experiment is actually carried out: The symmetry of fairness is broken and one of the films becomes the winner. Even in situations like this, in which we know there is no \"reason\" that the coin flips should favor one film over the other, psychologists have shown that the temptation to concoct imagined reasons to account for skewed data and other patterns is often overwhelming.     In science, data are not accepted as meaningful if they're the result of chance alone. People in the film industry are diligent about gathering data, but are far less skilled at understanding what the numbers mean. The fact is, financial success or failure in Hollywood is determined less by anyone's skill to pick hits, or lack thereof, than by the random nature of the universe. The typical patterns of randomness—apparent hot or cold streaks, or the bunching of data into clusters—are routinely misinterpreted and, worse, acted upon as if a new trend had been discovered or a new epiphany achieved. And so, despite a growing body of evidence that box-office revenue follows the laws of chaotic systems, meaning that it is inherently unpredictable, the superstructure of Hollywood's culture—that pervasive worship of who's hot and the shunning of who's not—continues to rest on a foundation of misconception and mirage.

That’s organ as in kidney or liver, not organ as in church or Hammond. It’s an interesting entry to a very topical topic: one that still has shock value but which we are going to hear about more in the future.\nMy point of view, unsurprisingly, is that I don’t trust market mechanisms to deal with the problem. This essay is a starting point for thinking about it. I hope to follow it up later with a second attempt.\nThe reason people are talking about buying and selling kidneys is that organ transplants are safe and cheaper than they used to be, so lots of sick people could benefit from an increase in organ donations, and so that spare kidney you’ve been keeping around is now a very popular kidney, used and second-hand though it be. So why, ask Dubner and Levitt, don’t we let people buy and sell their kidneys? After all, “most people can live safely on one kidney”, they say. They suggest that the main reason we don’t allow buying and selling of kidneys is what they call “the repugnance factor”, and they have a point, even though another reason is that it’s impossible to read that sentence without it looking like this: “most BUT NOT ALL!!! people can live safely on one kidney UNLESS SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH THE OTHER ONE”.\nThe Dubner and Levitt article is a bit odd actually. It suggests it’s talking about how paying people for their kidneys may save the lives of people who need a new kidney, while also letting people with spare kidneys earn some cash on the side. But when it comes to the specifics they don’t talk about buying and selling at all. Instead, they talk about a matching program that matches incompatible donor-patient pairs. In these pairs, each potential donor’s kidney is a bad match for the immune systems of their partner—but the system matches them with similarly incompatible pairs and the two matched pairs can basically swap a kidney. No money involved. Then they talk about a potential donor who was going to sell his kidney to a stranger and, when he discovered that accepting payment for organs is illegal, went ahead and donated it anyway. No money exchanged. They don’t really investigate payment for organs at all.\nStill, even if D\u0026amp;L don’t actually talk about trading our internal garbage collectors for money, other people are doing so. Down the hall from Steven Levitt at the University of Chicago is Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize winner who is in favour of markets in everything. Together with graduate student Julio Elias, Becker has talked up the idea for several years now and – Becker being Becker \u0026ndash; he gets a fair amount of press for it.\nThere are some technical reasons why I’m not convinced by Becker and Elias’s argument (PDF). They aren’t at the centre of my problems with the idea, but effectiveness does matter, so let me pursue these problems here.\nFirst, they maintain that right now the supply curve for kidneys is vertical. That is, a fixed amount of people are prepared to donate kidneys. But the people most likely to donate kidneys are the relatives of those on the operating table, so when the number of operations increases, so the number of those relatives increases, and so the supply of kidneys increases. It looks to me like that line should be sloping. Have I missed something? Hey, it’s been known.\nThey go on to suggest that the actual number of kidneys needed for transplants, compared to the total renal population of North America, is so small that once you offer a reasonable amount of money you could get as many kidneys as you could possibly want. That is, by offering payment the supply curve goes from vertical to horizontal. And then they go on to calculate how much you’d need to offer to induce people to sell. What they don’t take account of (though in a more recent essay Becker considers and dismisses this argument) is the possibility that offering to pay for kidneys might actually cut down the supply. This would be counter to most economic thinking, of course. The argument goes back to Richard Titmuss, a British academic who wrote a few decades ago about blood donation in a book entitled “The Gift Relationship”. Titmuss argued that offering to pay for blood would actually dissuade some people from donating, because whereas people feel good about themselves for donating blood, they don’t feel good about themselves for selling blood. Recent experiments in Sweden suggest that there is something to Titmuss idea. Becker doesn’t provide a real case against it, he just asserts that the effect would be small.\nPut these two things together and the effectiveness of even a perfect market with no cheating or deception is less attractive than Becker suggests. Instead of a dramatic change from a vertical supply curve to a horizontal one, you have a more nuanced change. And that’s if everything else works dine.\nBecker also dismisses the other main arguments about the introduction of payments, which are:\n that the result will be poor people selling their kidneys in order to supply longer life to the rich, giving yet another twist to the growing gap between rich and poor in the world.\n that the dangers of malpractice and deception of one form or another are so large – especially for those without the resources to get legal assistance and advice, that poor people in particular will be preyed on.\n that just about any system you put in place provides incentives for all kinds of nastiness. This applies to presumed consent mechanisms as well. And although this kind of thing can sometimes be dealt with, it’s costly to do so.\n  Well, I hope to look at some of these in a Part II later.\nThere are some countries that have already taken deliberate steps to make it easier for people to get new organs. Nancy Scheper-Hughes is a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and she has carried out research on organ trading around the world. In a 2003 forum she described these efforts:\nThere’s the Israeli model: very low donation rates so you export your transplant patients elsewhere and you give them medical insurance to pay for it, even at the cost of their buying kidneys from poor peasants in Eastern Europe. There are the Philippine, Iranian and Iraqi models: government-sponsored payments that allow very poor people to sell their organs for as low as $500, which leads to deep social resentments. The Chinese model: you can use the organs of executed prisoners. The Russian model: in which there’s not such a careful monitoring of confirmatory tests for brain death. The Spanish model: paying the procurers. More humanely, there is the Austrian and Belgian model of presumed consent.    There’s no doubt other countries will be dealing with the issue in the future. But Scheper-Hughes is on the money (so to speak) when she points out that the presumed consent model requires a trust in the fairness of the medical system that certainly doesn’t exist in the US.\n“we don’t have the kind of social consensus whereby people feel that their organs will be fairly and equally distributed among the poor as well as the wealthy or well insured, among women as well as men, or that all will have an equal right to get an organ should they need one. So first we have to address the lack of national health care, the 44 million uninsured, and the contradiction in asking poor people in America – who tend by and large to be over-represented in emergency rooms and ICUs – to donate organs when they and their relatives may not even have basic health care.    Canada may not be in quite the same straights as the US in that way, but it’s got some real issues, and they need to be dealt with in order to deal with the issues surrounding organ transplants.\n","date":1152568325,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"c654b5ea0d163165431be80cbc8192e4","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/juicy_kidneys_g/","publishdate":"2006-07-10T21:52:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/juicy_kidneys_g/","section":"post","summary":"RAD points me to a New York Times article by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt about buying and selling organs.

The train was late. A voice came over the public address system saying “We apologize for the late arrival of the 10:30 to Brighton”. Fair enough. Then ten minutes later, the same voice, in the same intonation, said the same words: “We apologize for the late arrival of the 10:30 train to Brighton”. Ten minutes more, the same thing. And so on for an hour or so until the train finally arrived.\nWhat stayed with me was not the lateness of the train — the day was so hot that tracks were buckling and we knew on setting off that we were in for delays — it was that announcement. The words themselves sounded like an apology, but, just like “your call is important to us”, the message that came through to me was the exact opposite of what the words themselves said.\nLiterature scholars have a notion of something called “performative language”. The idea is that while most utterances simply talk about the world (“That daisy is yellow”) others actually perform an action. “I resign”, when spoken to your boss, is not just a statement, it is an action that changes your status from employed to unemployed. “I do” when said in the right place and in front of the right audience, actually changes the speaker’s status from unmarried to married.\n“We apologize” can be a performative utterance. When offered in the correct way, saying you’re sorry is not just a statement about the world, it is an act: the act of apologizing. But it’s not always a performative utterance. It needs two things to make it so.\nFirst, and most obviously, someone needs to say it. Without an apologizer, there can be no apology. An automated system cannot apologize.\nIt could be argued that on that railway platform, even though there was no human individual speaking, the one making the apology was the company. The recorded voice actually comes from the railway company, and was simply transmitted by the automatic system, just like a letter carrier delivers a letter. But it turns out there is a problem with this too, and the problem is cost.\nApologizing, as we all know, can be a difficult thing to do, and that difficulty is part and parcel of the act of apologizing. Imagine receiving an apology for a deeply painful betrayal delivered casually, in a way that made it clear it carried no more emotional cost than commenting on the weather. You would understand immediately that it was not an apology at all, even if it contained the words “I apologize”. It is “cheap talk”, and while it could be an attempt to get you to be quiet and leave the offender alone, or to postpone the inevitable recriminations, or one of several other things, cheap talk can’t be an apology.\nSo when an automated system says “we apologize” then there is, in fact, no apology happening, no matter how often it says it. When the only action it takes to deliver the words is pushing a button somewhere, at the most, then the statement is “cheap talk”: cost-free communication that should carry no weight.\nWe are getting to understand the business of “speech without a speaker”. When we hear an automated voice saying “Your call is important to us” most of us do receive the real message. We know that if our call was really important then there would be a person there to receive it. The words are not the message; the automated system that delivers it is.\nWe understand that the letters we get from company CEOs offering us new deals do not, of course, come from the CEO at all. He (or occasionally she) may not even have read it, let alone written it. May not even know of its existence.\n“Have a nice day” is a variant on the same theme: the phrase is often said by a real person, so it seems like there is a speaker, but if the hapless individual behind the till is reciting a script, and if delivering that script is a condition of their employment, then they are not really the speaker; they are simply passing on a message from someone else. And that someone else has no interest in the niceness (or otherwise) of your day: it is simply a calculated policy to give the appearance of friendliness.\nOn occasion, of course, someone behind a till is in a friendly mood, and actually gives the words real meaning. But most of us can tell the difference between such a sincere utterance and someone delivering a programmed script.\nBut while we are adjusting to the problem of speech without a speaker, we have not really started adjusting to the other changes that cheap communications technology are bringing. We know that our mediums of communication are changing, with new forms of internet-based communications mutating every few years, from e-mail to instant messaging to weblogs and more. What we need to adjust to is the way that the economics of these new media change the meaning of the messages we send and receive.\nMany of us do adjust to these changes in meaning in our personal communications. A Christmas letter sent by e-mail to a long list of recipients means less to us than an individually handwritten letter. But our social systems are slower to change. In particular, there are forms of legal communication that have built into them an assumption of cost, but which can now be made very cheaply.\nA new communication mutant was described recently by Mark Rasch, former head of the US Justice Department’s computer crime unit, in The Register, an online journal of technology comment. Rasch writes about “robolawyers” or “lawyerbots”: programs designed to search the Internet for suspected violations of a company’s copyright or trademark. A lawyerbot can be designed not only to detect possible violations, perhaps by searching for keywords or combinations of words, it can also be designed to send out legal warnings (Rasch calls them “takedown notices”) to the owners and hosts of the sites involved.\nThe legality of these automated takedown notices has not been tested. But they don’t have to go to court to be effective. Internet Service Providers and other web site hosts such as eBay don’t like the possibility of lawsuits, and their legal liability for the content of the sites that they host is uncertain, so these notices are often enough to persuade them to take down the problematic material, regardless of whether there is anything wrong with it or not.\nRasch writes about Brian Kopp, who wrote a book based on the popular online game “World of Warcraft” and offered it for sale on the eBay auction site. The book was, by all accounts, in the spirit of those “Dummies” guides that tell you how to use Microsoft Word and other software products – an unauthorized third party guide, but not defamatory or illegal. Once Kopp posted his book, however, eBay began receiving a stream of “takedown notices” telling them that the book violated the rights of Blizzard, the company that owns World of Warcraft, and that they should remove it from their site. eBay responded by not only removing the book, but cancelling Kopp’s account so that he could not auction anything else either.\nIt is impossible to know for sure whether there were any real people involved at any stages of this campaign against Brian Kopp (who is almost certainly real, although not a very good writer). Rasch notes that Kopp’s eBay auction generated “a slew of takedown notices from various parties. As soon as he reposted the auction, it generated a new takedown notice. Human lawyers are generally not that efficient. So these autonomous agents may in fact be the ones generating these takedown notices.” So did any real person at Blizzard know they were sending takedown notices to Mr. Kopp? Quite possibly not. Had anyone (apart from a computer) “read” his book? Probably not. Did an individual at eBay weigh the evidence and decide what action to take, or does eBay have a program to disable accounts if it receives a sufficient number of complaints? Unclear.\nThe fact that legal letters rarely go to court, and the fact that they can be generated programmatically, means that automated legal notices are likely to increase. We are already subject to automated legal checks whenever we install new software, in those End User License Agreements that we have to say we’ve read even though we obviously haven’t, and even though they are not designed to be read. Increasingly, those agreements include clauses that let software report back to the company that made it about the use we make of it, or details about our computer. Such information can have legitimate uses, enabling better fixing of software problems for example, but it can also have illegitimate uses.\nThere is an assumption in our legal system that a legal notice follows some kind of investigation, however cursory, on the part of the party that issues it. That is, it is a document to be taken seriously. But auto-generated and widely distributed legal notices are “cheap talk”, and their increasing ease of generation means that, like the apology at the railway station, they should be treated as meaningless.\nIt would be easy to dismiss Brian Kopp’s case as absurd if it wasn’t so clearly a harbinger of things to come. As lawyerbots proliferate, companies will find it worthwhile to develop other lawyerbots to handle incoming “letters” and we will have legal communications that nobody writes and nobody reads. If a letter is delivered and nobody reads it, does it carry any meaning? If lawyerbots were just sending meaningless messages back and forth, nothing would be lost except for a bit of Internet bandwidth, but it seems that the legal system has not yet adjusted to this new mutant, and so such communications can be damaging.\nIncreasing automation means that forms of communications are mutating ever more quickly. Some developments are not difficult to foresee. As with all things computer-related, it is clear that automated communication is going to be more common – a lot more common – in the future than it is now. The near future will bring automated translation software that can provide good enough translation in a wider and wider set of circumstances. It will also bring speech comprehension software, and text-to-speech software of increasing subtlety: no more jerky sentences with those pasted together words – the audio equivalent of the ransom note pasted together from newspapers. Put them all together and programs will soon be carrying out conversations with people around the world, persuading us to part with our money in new and grammatically sophisticated ways, using voices designed to exploit our sympathies and prejudices.\nExcept they are not voices and not conversations at all, they just sound like they are. We need to be consistently on our guard if we are to avoid becoming confused by these mutant communications. As a first step, we need to acknowledge that machine-delivered apologies are not apologies, no matter how sincere they sound. And we need to decide that lawyerbot-delivered threats and warnings carry as much weight as the cost of delivering them, which is zero.\n","date":1151885699,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"5a3ba5a7fe4a4b30fca2aeb44d10c1e3","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/have_your_robot/","publishdate":"2006-07-03T00:14:59Z","relpermalink":"/post/have_your_robot/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a draft of something I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on over the weekend\u0026hellip;\nOn a hot summer’s day a few years ago I was waiting at a train station in the UK.

Times journalist Peter Gosselin about the challenges facing post-Katrina New Orleans. The sheer size of the reconstruction task is daunting, of course, but Schelling talked about something different: the difficulties faced by individual evacuees trying to decide whether or not to move back to the city: “It is essentially a problem of coordinating expectations”, he said. “If we all expect each other to come back, we will. If we don’t, we won’t. But achieving this co-ordination in the circumstances of New Orleans seems impossible.”\nGosselin described the “circumstances of New Orleans” that Schelling was talking about. Washington, he showed, had initially promised large-scale aid, but had then backed off from those commitments, leaving evacuees to make tough decisions on their own. The New Orleans recovery became “a private market affair”. Unfortunately, as Schelling said, the recovery was all about co-ordination, and “There are classes of problems that free markets simply do not deal with well. If ever there was an example, New Orleans is it.”\nOne of the things about co-ordination problems is that small things can make a big difference. A relatively small kick at the right time can give the process a start and help virtuous cycles to develop. As a result, the right kick can pay benefits out of all proportion to its size. Once the ball is moving in the right direction, people start to move back because others are moving back, and each individual or family that makes the decision makes it easier for still others to move back too.\nWithout a successful kick start, co-ordination problems are prone to cycles that are vicious rather than virtuous. When uncertainty over the future looms large, many evacuees will not return unless they know that others are moving back too. As Republican representative Richard Baker said “It does no good to stand up just one person or family, because there’s nothing left where they once lived – no schools or grocery stores, doctors or banks, police stations or fire trucks. We’ve got to go into the business of restoring whole communities.”\nAfter Katrina, two things were clear about the kick that New Orleans needed to get resettlement and rebuilding started. First, it had had to come from Washington – the only level of government with the resources to provide it. Second, it had to deal with the core issue of safety. As the New York Times said in an editorial, “It all boils down to the levee system. People will clear garbage, live in tents, work their fingers to the bone to reclaim homes and lives, but not if they don’t believe they will be protected by more than patches to the same old system that failed during the deadly storm. Homeowners, businesses and insurance companies all need a commitment before they will stake their futures on the city.”\nEarly on, it looked as if Washington might be prepared to make the kind of commitment that was needed. The tone was set by President Bush in a September 15 (2005) speech in New Orleans itself: “There is”, he said “no way to imagine America without New Orleans”, and he promised “one of the largest reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen.” “We will do what it takes”, he continued, “we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.”\nThese are fine words, but they needed to be backed quickly with decisive, large-scale action. And they weren’t. The White House “sat on its pledges all autumn, mumbling homilies about the limits of government.” The Treasury refused to guarantee New Orleans municipal bonds, which had lost all their value, and as a result the mayor was forced “to lay off 3,000 city employees on top of the thousands of education and medial workers already jobless”.\nNine months after the storm, over half of the 500,000 residents of the city of New Orleans have not returned. There is little doubt about the fact of the failure.\nBut the story of the reconstruction is not just the story of Washington’s failure to provide tangible commitment. Louisiana in general, and New Orleans in particular, are full of groups with their own agenda. There are some who see the failure of poor people to come back to their homes as a good thing. In New Orleans itself, some of the richer residents wanted to see a different kind of city. In the weeks following the flood Jimmy Reiss, the head of the city\u0026rsquo;s Business Council, talked to Newsweek of “a once in an eon opportunity to change the dynamic” of the city. He has been quoted as saying “Those who want to see this city rebuilt want to see it done in a completely different way: demographically, geographically and politically,\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not just speaking for myself here. The way we\u0026rsquo;ve been living is not going to happen again, or we\u0026rsquo;re out.” In short, fewer poor people and a smaller, whiter, richer city.\nThe inability of free markets to help people return gives an opportunity for agendas such as these to be driven forward, all the while asserting that people are making their own choices about their futures. The horns of the return-or-not dilemma are sharper for some than for poor people than for rich people. Those without savings can least afford to make the effort to generate the coordination and investment of effort and resources needed to rebuild their own communities. A recent US Census study showed that the poorer people tended to be driven further away from the city in search of affordable places to live. And the poorer areas of the city are in the more vulnerable areas, where continuing uncertainty over issues such as insurance plagues any attempt at progress.\nSo it’s not surprising that Joseph Canizaro, another wealthy property developer and prominent Bush supporter said as early as October 2005 “As a practical matter, these poor folks don’t have the resources to go back to our city just like they didn’t have the resources to get out of our city. So we won’t get all those folks back. That’s just a fact.”\nAnd so it has proved. Overall, poor people have returned in fewer numbers than wealthy people. In a city where the lines between rich and poor are often the lines between white and black, those who have returned are more likely to be white and wealthy than those who have not. New Orleans had a black population of 36% before Katrina, now it has a black population of 21%.\nSome would argue that Canizaro, in his role as head of the urban planning committee of the Bring New Orleans Back commission, helped to turn his blunt “that’s just a fact” observation into a reality. He lobbied for a building moratorium in the hardest hit neighbourhoods while they proved their viability: funds would go only to those neighbourhoods where at least half of the residents had made a commitment to return. Such a moratorium just compounds the Catch 22. Now no building can happen unless there are people willing to buy or rent it. And no one will return to buy or rent unless they know there will be a building for them. And we know who is affected most by such a criterion: it’s the poor people again.\nThere was a bigger agenda behind the suggestion. Once these areas had predictably failed to “prove their viability” the BNOB commission proposed a new public agency that would have been “empowered to seize land in areas that failed the challenge” (NYT). That is, homeowners who did not have the resources to return would be doubly punished by having their land seized. A visiting developer told the BNOB commission “Your housing is now a public resource. You can’t think of it as private property any more.\u0026rdquo; The Urban Land Institute, a property developers’ organization, argued that the mayor let the market reshape New Orleans, and turn areas where redevelopment fails into parkland.\nWashington’s failure of commitment, the predictable failure of market mechanisms to help people return to New Orleans, and the exploitation of that failure to remake New Orleans in a different manner, is not a cheery story. There are, however, a few bright lights in the picture.\nThe developer-led agenda for a smaller, richer, and whiter city is meeting with some resistance. The BNOB plan was greeted by a public outcry. Mayor Nagin, whose position is difficult to read and who is often happy to go along with the inevitable co-ordination failure in the absence of real commitment — he has said that anyone who really wants to will \u0026ldquo;figure out a way to come back.\u0026rdquo; —rejected the plan, and according to the NYT the BNOB has hardly been heard of since. But many of those who proposed it continue to be in influential positions, and continue to have ways to meet their goals.\nThe main source of hope is strong community organizations. In his LA Times article, Peter Gosselin wrote about Greek Orthodox community and the way in which its church helped its members to co-ordinate their escape from Katrina and their return afterwards. “By acting in concert, members of the Greek community have in effect provided each other with an immense self-insurance policy, guaranteeing that if one family rebuilds, others will.” Community activist groups such as the ACORN Katrina Survivors Association have helped to give people the means to co-ordinate their own return and a voice to influence the way that New Orleans is being rebuilt, campaigning for a right to return.\nThe future still looks grim for the survivors of Hurricane Katrina. But if the residents of New Orleans are to be a part of the rebuilt city, and if Washington is unwilling to help, then it is groups such as these that hold the key to success.\n","date":1151337891,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f5498a0347734a6f4af912d64a26ba54","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/coordination_fa/","publishdate":"2006-06-26T16:04:51Z","relpermalink":"/post/coordination_fa/","section":"post","summary":"Just before going to Oslo to collect his Nobel Prize for Economics in December 2005, Thomas Schelling was interviewed by L.A.

But I could not help contrast the idea that the killing of Zarqawi is somehow significant with the following two pieces.\nFirst, from the best blogger in the world at Baghdad Burning.\nWe heard the news about the dozens abducted from the Salhiya area in Baghdad. Salhiya is a busy area where many travel agencies have offices. It has been particularly busy since the war because people who want to leave to Jordan and Syria all make their reservations from one office or another in that area.    According to people working and living in the area, around 15 police cars pulled up to the area and uniformed men began pulling civilians off the streets and from cars, throwing bags over their heads and herding them into the cars. Anyone who tried to object was either beaten or pulled into a car. The total number of people taken away is estimated to be around 50.    This has been happening all over Iraq- mysterious men from the Ministry of Interior rounding up civilians and taking them away. It just hasn’t happened with this many people at once. The disturbing thing is that the Iraqi Ministry of Interior has denied that it had anything to do with this latest mass detention (which is the new trend with them- why get tangled up with human rights organizations about mass detentions, torture and assassinations- just deny it happened!). That isn’t a good sign- it means these people will probably be discovered dead in a matter of days. We pray they’ll be returned alive…    Another piece of particularly bad news came later during the day. [Several students riding a bus to school were assassinated in Dora area. ](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060605/ts_nm/iraq_dc_223;_ylt=An_yyn96X_i1DTdg8J7K8WYUewgF;_ylu=X3oDMTA2ZGZwam4yBHNlYwNmYw--)No one knows why- it isn’t clear. Were they Sunni? Were they Shia? Most likely they were a mix… Heading off for their end-of-year examination- having stayed up the night before to study in the heat. When they left their houses, they were probably only worried about whether they’d pass or fail- their parents sending them off with words of encouragement and prayer. Now they’ll never come home.    There’s an ethnic cleansing in progress and it’s impossible to deny. People are being killed according to their ID card. Extremists on both sides are making life impossible. Some of them work for ‘Zarqawi’, and the others work for the Iraqi Ministry of Interior. We hear about Shia being killed in the ‘Sunni triangle’ and corpses of Sunnis named ‘Omar’ (a Sunni name) arriving by the dozen at the Baghdad morgue. I never thought I’d actually miss the car bombs. At least a car bomb is indiscriminate. It doesn’t seek you out because you’re Sunni or Shia.    We still don’t have ministers in the key ministries- defense and interior. Iraq is falling apart and Maliki and his team are still bickering over who should get more power- who is more qualified to oppress Iraqis with the help of foreign occupiers? On top of all of this, rumor has it that the Iraqi parliament have a ‘vacation’ coming up during July and August. They’re so exhausted with the arguing, and struggling for power, they need to take a couple of months off to rest. They’ll leave their well-guarded homes behind for a couple of months, and spend some time abroad with their families (who can’t live in Iraq anymore- they’re too precious for that).    And second, from Juan Cole at Informed Comment:\nZarqawi had been a significant leader of the Salafi Jihadi radical strain of Islamist volunteers in Iraq, and had succeeded in spreading his ideas to local Iraqis in places like Ramadi. He engaged in grandstanding when he renamed his group \"al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia,\" even though he had early been critical of al-Qaeda and had a long rivalry with it. For background, see [the Zarqawi file](http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Ejrcole/zarqawi/zarqawix.htm). There is no evidence of operational links between his Salafi Jihadis in Iraq and the real al-Qaeda; it was just a sort of branding that suited everyone, including the US. Official US spokesmen have all along over-estimated his importance. Leaders are significant and not always easily replaced. But Zarqawi has in my view has been less important than local Iraqi leaders and groups. I don't expect the guerrilla war to subside any time soon. Baqubah is dangerous not because of Zarqawi but because it is a mixed Sunni-Shiite and Kurdish area that had Baath military installations and arms depots, and enough Sunni Arabs from the old regime know about them to work them against rising Shiite and Kurdish dominance. On the other hand, there have been persistent reports of a split between the main arm of the guerrilla resistance, the Sunni Arab Iraqis, and Zarqawi's group. [Al-Hayat reports today [Ar.]](http://www.daralhayat.com/arab_news/levant_news/06-2006/Item-20060607-b0285dac-c0a8-10ed-00c1-55653b5c5568/story.html) that groups in Fallujah have launched attacks on Zarqawi followers there after the latter attacked the al-Husain Mosque in the Askari quarter two days ago, destroying the tomb of the founder of the mosque within it. (Salafis influenced by Saudi Wahhabism despise attendance at saints tombs, insisting on a Protestant-like elimination of all intermediaries between human beings and God. Many Islamists in Fallujah are actually Sufis, who value saints in the way rural Catholics do.) An attempt by the radical Salafis to destroy the mosque (on the grounds that it had been tainted with polytheism) was stopped by the \"1920 Revolution Brigades,\" a local ex-Baathist group. There was a running gun battle between the two. Zarqawi's group had also tried two days ago to attack a Fallujah police station, but they were repulsed by local tribal youth. The battle left two cars burned and 4 dead from the tribe of Al-Bu `Isa.    The contrast between the dregs we get on the news here and these kind of comments is astounding. Read the two of them, and it\u0026rsquo;s clear that this event will have no effect whatsoever on the level of destruction in Iraq.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been reading these writers for a couple of years or so. Both have shown a steady progression towards disillusionment, anger, and despair over the state of Iraq.

Given AP\u0026rsquo;s love of tweaking eaters of organic foods, my guess is that he\u0026rsquo;s on board with the American Enterprise Institute on this one.\nNevertheless, and much as I enjoyed most of Rebel Sell, he would be wrong. The AEI piece is MarketThink at its crudest.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s get past the sneers. There\u0026rsquo;s the title \u0026ldquo;Attack of the Snobs\u0026rdquo; itself, of course. Then organizations opposing Wal-Mart are \u0026ldquo;a regular terrarium of screamers\u0026rdquo;. The leaders are \u0026ldquo;Kerry and Dean assassins and union activists\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; two groups of people it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to tell apart, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. Wal-Mart\u0026rsquo;s success has come about \u0026ldquo;contrary to snotty stereotypes,\u0026hellip; not by piling clip-on ties and plastic shoes ever deeper on tabletops, but rather via intensive, inventive, high-tech management\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone who believes that snotty stereotype, so I think AEI are indulging a few stereotypes of their own. Then they have graphics showing a drawing of a placard with \u0026ldquo;Suburbia is Rape!\u0026rdquo; on it \u0026ndash; not a real placard, mind you, just the American Enterprise image of what a placard might be. Once you get past that stuff, you\u0026rsquo;ve thrown out 80% of the AEI papers.\nBut there is a bit left over. And in that bit there is a big assumption right at the heart of \u0026ldquo;In Praise of Ordinary Choices\u0026rdquo; that persists in the other articles I\u0026rsquo;ve read from the issue (ie, those that are free). Which is that we\u0026rsquo;ve somehow chosen our cities and living environments, and that the fact so many people shop at Wal-Mart means they approve of everything it does. That\u0026rsquo;s what they mean by \u0026ldquo;ordinary choices\u0026rdquo;, and that\u0026rsquo;s why they start the lead article by saying \u0026ldquo;The problem with most writing about cities is that people go out and say, \u0026lsquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s what I like\u0026rsquo;, and the corollary to that is usually, \u0026lsquo;This is what cities ought to be\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; In contrast, the AEI believe that our preferences as revealed in our \u0026ldquo;ordinary choices\u0026rdquo; are reflected in the growth of cities. They praise author Robert Bruegmann, saying that he\n\"observes carefully, and shows respect for the billions of small judgments made by ordinary citizens in the course of their daily lives---choices which have cumulatively created the complex \"horizontal\" communities that Americans now call home.\"    This is wrong in two ways. First, it is basically an assertion that the good things about places where we live [and yes, there are good things] came about because of free-market choices, though even south of the border cities are a mix of market-driven development and urban planning. So that assertion is wrong. Second, it asserts that as long as we have free choice, we\u0026rsquo;ll get the kind of cities we want. But even if the AEI believes this, Andrew Potter knows that\u0026rsquo;s not how individual choice works. He wrote a big part of Rebel Sell based on the problems of arms races and collective action problems, in which individual choices lead to bad results.\nRobert Bruegmann himself makes the same kind of assertions. \u0026ldquo;Europeans are moving into suburbs in increasing numbers\u0026hellip; In country after country across Europe, consumers are demanding the convenience of longer store hours, shops closer to where they live, and easier access by automobile. The result is a proliferation of large supermarkets, shopping centers, discount centers, and Big Box retail outlets like Wal-Mart or Target\u0026rdquo;. The implication is clear, in context, that because people want longer store hours, they are somehow voting for the Big Box outlets and the environment they bring with them. But that implication is false. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t follow.\nOr in \u0026ldquo;Live with TAE\u0026rdquo;, Witold Rybcynski is quoted as saying \u0026ldquo;Sprawl has got good and bad sides, but it\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ve chosen as a people\u0026rdquo; which is also simply not true.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s be clear. To oppose the developer-driven, market-driven model of city growth that the AEI is promoting does not make you a snob (or an assassin come to think of it). And to observe that we live in sprawling cities doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we\u0026rsquo;ve chosen them. I hope AP agrees, but I fear he doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\n","date":1149540129,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"9f5f76a2a29f9df95886f7484729dadd","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/aei_does_market/","publishdate":"2006-06-05T20:42:09Z","relpermalink":"/post/aei_does_market/","section":"post","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s not quite clear whether Andrew Potter agrees with the American Enterprise Online when he posts pieces of an article that is part of their issue Attack of the Snobs.

The doorbell was answered by a young man with an obvious wound to the upper arm. Getting him onto the ambulance I learned that he had 'come clean' to his long-term girlfriend about cheating on her two years ago. During the course of the argument she had then stabbed him in the arm with a kitchen knife... My advice to everyone is that you shouldn't have an argument in the kitchen...    My brother likes a similar one by a policeman, \u0026ldquo;PC Copperfield\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;Newtown\u0026rdquo;, whose day includes things like this:\nI had to accompany a burglar to the local hospital because an injury he had sustained in the course of one of his crimes had become infected (poetic justice indeed). I had to sit handcuffed to him in the waiting room for an hour or so and eventually had to answer the call of nature. I removed my end of the handcuffs and attached them to the immovable waiting room chair before going to the toilet and collecting a few things from the car. On my return he said he felt humiliated, like an animal.     People of Newtown, I do what I can.

Here is an excerpt:\nReports have “revealed” the so-called secret fees paid by publishers to booksellers in order to get books stocked, “chosen” and recommended by the big book chains.     That W H Smith’s “book of the week” title, which attracts you as if it had won a prize, has been bought and paid for. The publisher handed over £50,000. Waterstone’s Book of the Week accolade is £10,000, less for ecstatic mini-reviews. Borders charges for “fiction buyer’s favourite”. Smaller sums buy other levels of prominence; only some local staff “picks” are related to actual content. It is not uncommon for a catalogue to recommend a title warmly before the compiler has even seen it. A pre-Christmas push costs £200,000 and a big campaign double that. One publisher told a newspaper: “We’ve got to play by the rules because we need them.” It is considered suicidal not to join in.    ...Seventy per cent of promotional budgets go on furtive payments to bookshops. The message to the author is: “Nobody would read you if we didn’t pay, so shut up grumbling.” To the reader the message is: “You are a fool pig, guaranteed to go for the shiniest swill-bucket.” To the newspapers who publish bestseller charts it is simply: “Gotcha!”     Most of these charts cover sales in one particular week, so they favour the fast-selling and heavily displayed. They are no index of pleasure or even real popularity. It is not uncommon for a book to reach high rank one week and live off that glory (“surprise soaraway bestseller for tragic Gwendolen”) when in fact it has shifted fewer hardbacks than another book that never got near the top 20 because it sold more gradually.    Well, so be it. Bookselling is a trade; it is sad but not criminal that it operates like one, cutting deals to maximise profit. It is sad but not surprising that big booksellers do not care that their practices are widening the gulf between hyped authors and the rest, squeezing out new writers and truncating the careers of those who fail to return the publisher’s investment fast enough. They do not care that the literary double-or-quits economy prevents the slower, organic growth of writing careers.     The responsibility spreads wider, though. You would think that, knowing how skewed the trade has become, book page editors would question the status quo as journalists do in every other area. You would think that their mission was to seek out interesting new books while scornfully ignoring hype-fests. There is little evidence of this, except in some odd and praiseworthy corners. Journalists like to feel they are up there with the “buzz”, even if the buzz is largely artificial. Where reviews do diverge from the well-trodden track of the week’s “key” books, it is often only into a cosy circuit of settling old scores, or bigging up friends who will soon return the favour. This is often undeclared, which shocks the strait-laced American media (read the _New York Times _arts ethical policy online, boys, and hang your heads).     Newspapers and magazines are also magpies, attracted to the glitter of the young, the pretty, the well-connected, the celebrity. If Keira Knightley publishes a novel tomorrow it will not go short of attention, while if a new Orwell or Greene emerges from the ranks he may fall back unnoticed. There are some flukes, but even notable “word of mouth” successes often turn out to be no such thing. And the moment an unhyped book starts to move, the big chains will be on to the publisher with display offers they dare not refuse. All success becomes a commodity.    This fits with what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, and with my argument in Chapter 9. Other reports (which I can\u0026rsquo;t find now) suggest that compared to ten years ago, more books are published now than used to be, and more titles are carried (in some form or other) by bookstores. But the total volume of books sold is about the same as it used to be, and of that amount more goes to just a few bestsellers. It\u0026rsquo;s what happens in a market when you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re buying. Book buying is going, apparently, from being a high-information market to a low-information market.\nOn the down side, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a depressing view of the book industry.

Some drivers thought so last weekend as they approached a bridge construction zone near Belleville, where the highway lanes narrowed from two to one. Giant tractor trailers seemed to line up side-by-side, blocking both lanes, and slow to a speed that left a half-kilometre gap between them and vehicles farther ahead, which were themselves following behind another set of trucks doing exactly the same thing.     Eventually, one truck let the other merge into the single lane, and everyone slipped past the construction without much fanfare. But it was slow moving. Some motorists became furious. A few honked their horns. Others, with teeth bared and nostrils flaring, took to the highway's gravel shoulder to bypass the lumbering mechanical beasts.     It might be easy to flip these truckers the bird and continue on your way, except that, as construction season begins, you should know that traffic experts, driving instructors and even the police say these trucks could be doing everyone a big favour.     Though technically not legal, their tactics over the Victoria Day weekend on the 401 ensured that vehicles passed through the construction zone faster and more smoothly than they otherwise would have.     By forcing all the vehicles leading into the merging lanes to a slower speed, they prevented the common stop and start \"slinky\" effect common to bottlenecks on any major roadway. This, experts say, makes traffic flow more efficiently.     \"If you have a construction site, you have all this manoeuvring trying to get through, and that can slow things down. So what the truck is doing is smoothing that flow,\" says Eric Miller, a civil engineering professor at the University of Toronto and a specialist in transportation systems modelling.     At the site of a merge, you're going to find people jockeying for position, trying to get through. This can lead to traffic \"turbulence.\"     \"But,\" says Miller, \"it's going on behind the truck, which doesn't affect the rate at which people are going through because they're sorted out by the time they get to the bottleneck.\"     Miller cautions this is simply a hypothesis, but it makes sense and should be studied mathematically.     \"Flows of vehicles on the roadway are very similar to water flowing through a pipe or air flowing over an airplane wing,\" he says. Ideally, you want the flow to be smooth, or laminar, rather than turbulent. Yvan Chartrand, president and founder of the 5th Wheel Training Institute, which has campuses in Warwick and New Liskeard, Ont., and graduates up to 700 new truck operators each year, said the technique is simple. He did it himself.     \"They create a buffer zone in front of them so if the cars ahead do stop, the trucks don't stop. If they did it well, these truckers didn't stop. They kept going, and when it was time to shrink down to one lane of traffic, they went one behind the other and went past the construction, and then the cars were allowed to pass,\" Chartrand explains.     In the process, the truckers avoid a situation where, near a bottleneck, they would have to keep stopping and starting their trailers, which takes much longer and requires much more space than a car to do so.     As a driver, he says, \"you don't take the time to think these things out, you'll think these trucks are holding you up. But if you were in a helicopter and saw how it all plays out, you would see that when it shrank to one lane, there was no waiting, no stopping; it was easier on the brakes, the clutch, fuel, and it saved energy and frustration.\" Chartrand says students are not taught such tactics as part of the school's curriculum, but instructors pass on their experience when students ask questions.     Most truckers get paid by the kilometre, not the hour, so they need to get where they're going as quickly and efficiently as possible.     You might conclude, then, that the tactic is less an act of altruism than selfishness.     \"I think it was probably a safe, but selfish act, to keep themselves moving, and not force themselves to do a dangerous manoeuvre,\" says Ed Popkie, the Institute's executive director.     Of course, car drivers are selfish, too. They typically don't let big rigs merge into their lanes, especially when they're rushing to get to the cottage on a long weekend.     So rather than find themselves in a situation where they might have to wait long periods for a sympathetic car driver, or get frustrated and possibly cut someone off, truckers sometimes \"take control of the situation,\" Popkie says.     They'll use their CB radios to call a trucker near them and arrange themselves to safely and smoothly keep their wheels moving. \"You might call out and say, `Okay, it's a go, we're going from two to one lane up here. Let's stick side by each. I'll let you in when we get to the end, and we'll make it through,'\" Popkie says.     While it may end up helping everybody in a bottleneck, it's certainly not legal, police say.When truckers travel side-by-side clogging up both lanes of a highway, police call it an \"elephant race\" — because they're big and slow.     \"That's an offence,\" says Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Cam Woolley, adding the OPP gets occasional complaints about the practice. \"It's failing to keep right, or unnecessarily slow driving.\"     Truckers have used blocking in the past to protest high fuel prices, he says, or simply to be mischievous.     Woolley cautions that it's not up to truckers to control traffic. \"If they wanted to maintain their own speed, to not stop and start, they should do that in the right-hand lane.\"     Chartrand pleads common sense. He says truckers' actions, like everyone else's, must be considered in context.     \"Is the trucker's intent to slow the traffic up, or is it his intention to make sure everyone gets there better and faster?\" he asks. \"Even though technically it may not be legal, what's wrong with it?\"     \"It's possible,\" Woolley concedes, \"if they were going as fast as they could without having to stop, it could have been a benefit to traffic, yes.\"     So the next time you find yourself in an elephant race, it may be useful to remember the story of the tortoise and the hare:     Slow and steady... slow and steady.

Most importantly, Americans take fewer (and shorter) vacations. The average American takes off less than six weeks a year; the average Frenchman almost twelve. The world champion vacationers are the Swedes, at 16 and a half weeks per year.     This raises more than one interesting question. First, why do Americans choose to work so much? (Or, if you prefer, why do Europeans choose to work so little?) Second, who's happier?     ... One trio of economists (Ed Glaeser of Harvard, Bruce Sacerdote of Dartmouth and Jose Scheinkman of Princeton) offers this explanation: When your wages are cut 20%, you take more vacations. But when your _friends'_ wages are also cut 20%, you'll take even _more_ vacations, because vacations are more fun when you've got friends to share them with. So a 20% across-the-board tax hike, which affects both you and your friends, yields a more dramatic response than a 20% cut in your own wages.     An overlapping trio (Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Harvard's Albert Alesina) give some credence to this \"social multiplier\" theory...but claim to have identified the primary culprit in European labor regulations. While 20% of American workers are unionized, more than 80% of workers are unionized in France and Sweden. And while American unions have spent the past few decades fighting for higher wages, European unions have fought for shorter hours.     Is that a good thing or a bad thing? According to traditional economic theory, workers are best off when they can decide for themselves how much to work. Some workers might choose long hours and big paychecks; others might choose less income and long vacations.     Union-inspired regulations, by restricting individual choice, can only make those workers worse off. But here's what traditional theory overlooks: If you live in Europe, then union regulations not only force _you_ to work less; they also force your _friends_ to work less--which can be a blessing if you're trying to coordinate a camping trip.     So at least in principle, coercive union rules could be good for everyone. So, for that matter, could high marginal tax rates, and for exactly the same reason: The more your friends are taxed, the easier it is to coax them into taking time off to share your vacation time.     ...If European and American paths continue to diverge, we'll soon learn a lot more about whether well-rested Frenchmen are happier than wealthy Americans.     _Steven Landsburg is an economics professor at the University of Rochester and the author of _The Armchair Economist _and _Fair Play.

It's the deceptive nature of choice in our society that provides the focal point for Tom Slee's philosophical inquiry into how and why we do certain things, even when our decisions conflict with our moral compass.     Slee, a research scientist and software professional, is intrigued by the notion that a society marketing itself as full of wondrous choices is nonetheless marked by a happiness quotient that's in continual decline.     We do have choices, from whether or not to smoke, drive vehicles with poor safety records, eat foods high in trans fats, or buy certain brands of shoes and clothing. But Slee wonders whether those choices are determined by free will or are driven by a hidden hand, a cultural subtext that provides only the illusion of freedom.     To illustrate his points, Slee creates a number of scenarios in the fictitious community of Whimsley, where Jack and Jill deal with issues such as the conflict between shopping in a suburban big box or supporting downtown independent stores, or the pros and cons of using lawyers during a divorce. All of these things, Slee argues, involve different levels of choice, and in some situations, a lack of choice actually results in a better outcome. He also explores the world of game theory with respect to choice, and analyzes the role of what he calls MarketThink -- the logic of the so-called free market that has driven economics for the past few decades (also known as globalization or corporate control).     Unfortunately, Slee's approach is often difficult to follow as he tries to piece together these various strands. It's almost as if Slee falls victim to having too many choices with regard to settling on a writing style, making for an uneven text that could have benefited from more coherence and continuity. Slee also makes numerous references to the notion of collective action as an alternative to MarketThink, but this thesis is never really developed, leaving the reader wondering why Slee chose not to explore what seems like a logical conclusion to the book's central issue. - _Matthew Behrens, a writer and editor in Toronto._    Oddly enough, I actually knew Mr. Behrens slightly many years ago.\nHow could this review be rephrased? how about this?\nemotional ... philosopical ... moral.

In a similar vein, here is Brad DeLong in his review of the Galbraith biography [J. Bradford DeLong (2005), \u0026ldquo;Sisyphus as Social Democrat: The Life and Legacy of John Kenneth Galbraith,\u0026rdquo; _Foreign Affairs _ 84:3 (May/June) ]\nThe right-wing claim that the most efficient economy is one in which the gales of perfect competition scour the land is, in Galbraith's view, nonsense. Modern industrial and post-industrial production is a large-scale process, large-scale processes require planning, and planning requires stability -- which means that the gales of the market must be calmed.    This political vision, however, has been in retreat since the early 1980s. Nobody wants to hear about the importance of Big Government, Big Bureaucracy, or Big Labor (which hardly even exists). Galbraith's economic views have undergone an even more distressing eclipse. Among economists (excluding economic historians), the 70-year-olds have read Galbraith and think he is very important; the 50-year-olds have read Galbraith and know that the 70-year-olds think he is important but are not sure why; and the 30-year-olds have not even read him.     ...     What has survived throughout is the American myth of rugged individualism, and it is this that Parker's political story neglects. The power of this myth has meant that the United States is not, and never will be, a European-style social democracy. People may come together for barn raisings, but America is still the land of upward mobility and opportunity, where the most common questions are, I've done it, so why haven't you? and Doesn't this social solidarity stuff mean that I've got to pull more than my share of the weight? In spirit, it is still a nation of upwardly mobile immigrants blessed with an abundance of resources (free land) and an absence of government constraints (free labor).    Galbraith would say, sardonically, that this national self-image is just another fraudulent piece of conventional wisdom -- nurtured by the delusional, who cannot see reality, and the rich, who see it all too well but know that such delusions make them richer and more powerful. And Galbraith would be more than half right. But this self-image is also a very powerful social fact, and this more than anything else explains his waning influence on U.S. politics. It is not that the Democratic establishment has lost its nerve or been seduced by law firms and lobbyists; it is that the old Horatio Alger myth has proved extraordinarily durable.    Amartya Sen, not talking about Galbraith, said some of the same things about the way that economics has changed in the last 30 years:\nThere was a time -- not very long ago - when every young economict \"knew\" in what respect the market systems had serious limitations: all the textbooks repeated the same list of \"defects.\" The intellectual rejection of the market mechanism often led to radical proposals for altogether different methods of organizing the world (sometimes involving a powerful bureaucracy and unimagined fiscal burdens), without serious examination of the possibility that the proposed alternatives might involve even bigger failures than the markets were expected to produce. There was, often enough, rather little interest in the new and additional problems that the alternative arrangements may create.     The intellectual climate has changed quite dramatically over the last few decades, and the tables are now turned. The virtues of the market mechanism are now standardly assumed to be so pervasive that qualifications seem unimportant. Any pointer to the defects of the market mechanism appears to be, in the present mood, strangely old-fashioned and contrary to contemporary culture (like playing an old 78 rpm record with music from the 1920s). One set of prejudices has given way to anoother--opposite--set of preconceptions. Yesterday's unexamined faith has become today's heresy, and yesterday's heresy is now the new superstition. [Development as Freedom, p 111].    The role of myth, political outlook, and cultural climate is clear. One would think that in a discipline claiming to be objective that there would be a real effort to challenge its own assumptions, but such efforts appear to an outsider to be peripheral. Until such time as they are central, economics remains unscientific.\n ","date":1146473598,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"f18440a1e5ec0ce36063ab53c07ab27f","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/galbraith_and_t/","publishdate":"2006-05-01T08:53:18Z","relpermalink":"/post/galbraith_and_t/","section":"post","summary":"There have been many reflections on JK Galbraith and his impact on economics over the last few days, of course.

(Adrian Wyld/CP) _         Jacobs, author of _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_, and most recently, _Dark Age Ahead_, was 89.     Her powerful critiques about the urban renewal policies of North American cities have influenced thinking about urban planning for a generation.     Born May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Penn., Jacobs had made her home in Canada since the late 1960s.     Educated at Columbia University, she met her husband, architect Robert Jacobs, at the Office of War Information in New York, where she began writing during the war.     ** Known for protesting sprawl **     The strong themes of her writing and activism included opposition to expressways, including the Spadina Expressway in Toronto, and the support of neighbourhoods. Jacobs has been arrested twice while protesting urban plans she believed to be destructive.     She also explored these ideas in books such as _The Economy of Cities_, _Cities and the Wealth of Nations_ and _Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics_.     _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_, published in 1961, questioned the sprawling suburbs that characterized urban planning, saying they were killing inner cities and discouraging the economic vitality that springs organically from neighbourhoods.     ** Inspired 'Ideas That Matter' gathering **     Jacobs settled in Toronto in 1969. There she supported developments such as the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, an inner-city development for people of all income levels.     In 1997, the City of Toronto sponsored a conference entitled Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter, which led to a book of the same name.     Her most recent book, _Dark Age Ahead_ is \"a grave warning to a society losing its memory,\" jurists said in awarding her the $15,000 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing in 2005.     \"In spare, exquisite prose, Jane Jacobs alerts us to the dangers facing the family, higher education, science and technology, the professions, and fiscal accountability. Drawing on history, geography, and anthropology, this book reflects a lifetime of study and observation, offering us lessons to avoid decline,\" the jury said.     Dark Age Ahead finds comparisons between our current North American culture and European culture before the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent Dark Ages.     Interviewed by Canadian Press when she won the Shaughnessy Cohen Prize, Jacobs said, \"People really know themselves that the dark age is ahead. They're worried, and they haven't articulated it, but they feel it.\"     \"I think it's late but we don't need to go down the drain,\" she said. \"But we will if we aren't aware. It's a cautionary book.\"    ","date":1145972457,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"112b9f388d64b6a8c2689ba55261a958","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/jane_jacobs_die/","publishdate":"2006-04-25T13:40:57Z","relpermalink":"/post/jane_jacobs_die/","section":"post","summary":"Author of one of my favourite books of all time, and one of the clearest and most original thinkers I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read.

He is now in favour of nuclear power. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind that, even though I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with him \u0026mdash; changing your mind is not a bad thing. But something about his article really pisses me off, and it\u0026rsquo;s the conceit of the man. Look at these excerpts:\nIn the early 1970s when I helped found Greenpeace, I believed that nuclear energy was synonymous with nuclear holocaust, as did most of my compatriots. ... Thirty years on, my views have changed, and the rest of the environmental movement needs to update its views, too...    Here we go. Because he has changed his mind, Moore is now absolutely certain that everyone else needs to change their mind too. There is no modesty here; no asking the question: if I was wrong then, why should anyone listen to me now? no asking the question: if I was wrong then, might I be wrong now? No. Mr. Moore is as certain in his position now as he was then, insisting that everyone else needs to listen to him. Sorry. No can do.\nI don't want to underestimate the very real dangers of nuclear technology in the hands of rogue states, we cannot simply ban every technology that is dangerous....    Some years ago I took part in hearings on nuclear power in Ontario where thoughtful people from both sides took part. I was asked, by a member of the Ontario nuclear industry, exactly this question. I answered that it was a non-question. The statement is true of course, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you adopt every technology despite its dangers. You look at each case and make a decision. In fact, most of the arguments that Moore makes now in favour of nuclear energy are exactly the same as the ones being made then. For example, regarding Three Mile Island:\nWhat nobody noticed at the time, though, was that Three Mile Island was in fact a success story: The concrete containment structure did just what it was designed to do -- prevent radiation from escaping ... And although the reactor itself was crippled, there was no injury or death...    See what I mean? Just because Patrick Moore didn\u0026rsquo;t notice that Three Mile Island was a success story, he assumes no one else did either. Well, people did, on both sides of the debate. And some of us who opposed nuclear power then knew that it was kind of a success story, and wrestled with that, and decided that we still opposed nuclear power. But Moore apparently wasn\u0026rsquo;t among those wrestling with that problem, because he doesn\u0026rsquo;t listen to other people, he just tells them what to think,\nAnd I am not alone among seasoned environmental activists in changing my mind on this subject. On occasion, such opinions have been met with excommunicationfrom the anti-nuclear priesthood...    This is Mr. Moore trying to maintain for himself the position of rebel-with-a-cause. Not only was he a rebel then (an outspoken, independent-minded activist) but he\u0026rsquo;s a rebel now, against the people he was then a part of. But now he calls Friends of the Earth \u0026ldquo;the anti-nuclear priesthood\u0026rdquo; as if they are some kind of power centre. Give him a year or two and he\u0026rsquo;ll be railing against political correctness.\nThere are signs of a new willingness to listen, though, even among the staunchest anti-nuclear campaigners. ... nuclear is, by elimination, the only viable substitute for coal. It's that simple.    Oh come on. Here is that certainty again, that arrogant \u0026ldquo;if I can\u0026rsquo;t think of alternatives, then no one else can either\u0026rdquo; black-and-white thinking. He is so certain of his own opinions that they are now obvious. Until he changes his mind, and then his new position is obvious too.\nLet me be absolutely clear. It\u0026rsquo;s not the mind changing I object to. When it comes to that, I am firmly of the John Maynard Keynes school of thought (in response to a question about what he does when he gets new information, he answered \u0026ldquo;When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\u0026rdquo;) And it\u0026rsquo;s not the support for nuclear power that I object to, even though I don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Many thoughtful people are in favour of nuclear power. It\u0026rsquo;s the self-importance of his simple-minded thought that gets my blood pressure up.\nAnd happy Easter to you too.\nLink: Economist\u0026rsquo;s View: Global Warming and Nuclear Power.\n","date":1145181840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"277a450141961f2c40125a2f0625164a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/economists_view/","publishdate":"2006-04-16T10:04:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/economists_view/","section":"post","summary":"Via Mark Thoma, an unbelievably arrogant article by Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace.

Ottakar's, on the other hand, gives books more time to take off. There are two categories of books - the tortoises and the hares. If this deal goes ahead, we will end up with all hares and no tortoises.\" And it's not just authors who are apprehensive; figures from across the industry have voiced their concerns. Just last week I spoke to a representative from the Booksellers' Association, who told me that in his opinion, an Ottakar's takeover would have a devastating effect on publishers' chances of introducing debut novelists - or even the lesser-known works of popular authors - to new readers.     And the Ottakar's story is just the visible face of what is happening to independent bookshops across the UK. Although Ottakar's is a chain, it shares many of the strengths and weaknesses of the independents.

It\u0026rsquo;s a problem a little bit like why beer was bad in Britain for so long, which is something I recently wrote about. The piece I wrote is called Learning By Drinking, and its point of view is pretty much the opposite of most of those at Marginal Revolution, including Alex T. I was one of the early commenters in the thread, and I put a link to my own piece in my comment. No big deal.\nBut then Alex Tabarrok added a comment to the thread, and said this [emphasis added]:\n... Combined with Tom's comments about well-informed consumes and the lemons problem (_do read his longer post_) I think this could get us somewhere ...    And with that, all kinds of people came over to my site looking at the piece in question. As I mentioned just the other day, this is a quiet corner of the Internets, getting a handful of visitors each day. But all of a sudden I got 100 visitors yesterday and another 100 or so today, all thanks to Alex Tabarrok. And traffic, where weblogs are concerned, is a Good Thing.\nNow I like to think I\u0026rsquo;m more open minded than these pro-market types, but here is Alex T. sending people my way from his far more popular site to read a piece that he probably disagrees with. And I would not have thought to send people his way without a little dig at whatever it was they wrote. So it begins to look as if he is more open minded and generous than I am.

I simply don\u0026rsquo;t have that much to say, and even though I would not call myself busy by many people\u0026rsquo;s standards, I don\u0026rsquo;t always have the time to post something when I do think of something to say, or to find the article that prompted my thought again. There are plenty of weblogs out there which are updated multiple times a day. Such people are some combination of (a) well organized, (b) brilliant, or \u0026copy; egotistical. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say there\u0026rsquo;s a mix, and leave it at that.\nThere is a mismatch between blogging and other kinds of writing anyway. I wrote a book because it is a quiet occupation that suits me. It is a way of arguing without be ingdistracted by other people \u0026ndash; and other people, let\u0026rsquo;s face it, usually just get in the way of a well-thought out argument. Plus, it is a way of avoiding the hurly-burly of actual debate where you have to think on your feet and assert positions you are uncertain of. While blogging is not exactly like real life, it is a bit closer to it than the book thing: if you aim to gain an audience you have to pick up on what other bloggers are writing about and respond within hours. So really, blogging just isn\u0026rsquo;t my thing. The arguments go nowehere, no one changes their mind, and the signal/noise ratio is very low. The blogging world is a world built for quick-typing extroverts who don\u0026rsquo;t go in too much for second thoughts.\nAnd there is more to my agblosticism. With a book, you have to get a stamp of approval before inflicting your thoughts on readers (in the form of a publishing contract), so there is something un-egotistical about a book: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not the one claiming that my scribblings are worth reading, someone else thinks they are too\u0026rdquo;. But with a blog, or other intermediary-free publishing mechanism, there is something about the effort \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Here Are My Thoughts, Listen To Them!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; that is presumptious, almost distasteful. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided, though, that (with some exceptions) this impression of presumptiousness is wrong. I am not claiming that I have Thoughts You Should Know, I\u0026rsquo;m just keeping some writing here in this little corner where few people will look and using it as a place to keep my stuff. And if I end up wasting a few minutes of your time because you googled a combination of words that led you here instead of somewhere more useful, well I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but perhaps you should try a library instead of Google anyway.\nSo, to go back a couple of paragraphs, I have learned that I am not a natural blogger. Nevertheless, I\u0026rsquo;ll carry on with this effort. There are benefits, even without an audience (although hello there EAS, JC, and JAS, if you are still around). It is a useful place to keep some notes. It is a useful discipline to occasionally try to articulate thoughts that otherwise would remain even more foggy. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard from two people that I had lost touch with (hello PJM and MC) [which reminds me, I owe you both an e-mail]. And I still hope it will help to accumulate some additional material that may be of use to readers of my book, which is what this is all about.\nBut my advice to readers of this weblog is \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t expect anything and you won\u0026rsquo;t be too disappointed\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1142787347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"8f23d431b20d42ec5f8333cdd71e5007","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/not_a_blogger/","publishdate":"2006-03-19T16:55:47Z","relpermalink":"/post/not_a_blogger/","section":"post","summary":"I started this weblog because of the book, thinking that now it is going to be published I might as well do it right, and that means creating a little extra material around it if I can.

Apparently Wal-Mart likes drinks that use Splenda as a sweetener, and what Wal-Mart likes, it gets.\nOf course, the official word around all this is that it is a partnership, that Wal-Mart makes suggestions, and that \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a collaborative process\u0026rdquo; but it is clear who is calling the shots. Charles Fishman\u0026rsquo;s excellent book The Wal-Mart Effect documents many such cases of Wal-Mart reaching inside its suppliers and telling them what to produce and how much they (Wal-Mart) will pay for it. The suppliers are left with a Hobson\u0026rsquo;s Choice, especially in cases like Coke and Pepsi where there are two or more players in competition with each other. As the NYT article says:\n\"Wal-Mart wants competition,\" Mr. Greenberg said. \"They love that Coke and Pepsi kill each other in colas to service them.

I was not very impressed by the first third of the book, but the remainder is much better, although it does have some big flaws. In fact, the book would be a better one if Wolf had limited it to Part III (chapters 9 to 13) in which he tackles the arguments of what used to be called the anti-globalization movement. These chapters deal with the economic issues as Wolf sees them: inequality, trade, the role of corporations, the role of the state and the WTO, and finance.\nSo let’s deal with the good things first.\nWolf’s book is an argument against the “critics of globalization”, or “new millennium collectivists” (henceforth the Cs of G). And Wolf is, to be fair, faced with a problem because the movement (which hardly seems to be one any more, unfortunately never having recovered from the massive kick in the gut it received on 9\u0026frasl;11, but that’s another story) is just that – a movement. As a result it is, like most political movements, a mish-mash of people with conflicting ideas and beliefs, united only in their opposition to corporate-led globalization, and this makes it difficult to argue against. (Strangely, Wolf seems to think this lack of analytic rigour is indicative of woolly thinking on the part of everyone in that movement, rather than the unavoidable messiness of active coalition politics.)\nWolf tackles the problem by reducing the concerns of the Cs of G to a set of economic issues (see chapter list above) and splits each of those into a set of separate arguments, and then tackles each one in turn. This structure in itself is useful no matter what side you are on, as it brings some organization to the muddle of overlapping issues that are gathered under the heading of globalization. The end result is worth reading even if you disagree, especially because some books on the economic end of the Cs of G have been so sloppy (hello there Jerry Mander and Edward Goldsmith, whose “The Case Against the Global Economy” is a prime example).\nWolf makes a strong case on some issues (eg, he makes a good case that nation states still have a lot of power, despite what some claim), on other issues he puts out some arguments and facts that make you think (about inequality, for example) and highlights shoddy arguments (such as comparing the sales figures of the biggest multinationals to the GNP of nations). On other issues he is open minded enough to conclude that the picture is muddy, so for example he acknowledges that Naomi Klein has a point about export processing zones (p 241), that Dani Rodrik has some good things to say about the process of economic growth (p 204) and that Oxfam has some good things to say also about the traps that export-oriented countries have fond themselves in (p 204). He does have his prejudices though: for example, when it comes to so-called infant industry protection you can see his distaste at such an anti-free-trade strategy in his writing, and he is more damning of them than many others are, without really making the case. About the only prominent economic issue the book misses is the privatization of knowledge happening by the extension of intellectual property under the WTO TRIPS agreement, even though this is a major issue for many Cs of G. It\u0026rsquo;s an odd omission.\nOn the down side, Wolf really fails to see beyond the strictly economic side of many concerns. He dismisses Klein’s No Logo, saying that “analytically, No Logo adds nothing to the debate about globalization”. I disagree with him actually, but regardless, books can be important for reasons other than analytical contributions. Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle added nothing analytically to the debate over working conditions in Chicago meat-packing plants, but it was the most important and influential statement about the scandal anyway. Similarly, No Logo was important because Klein identified and distilled into a single, thorough book, the concerns of a heterogenous and disparate movement, and did so with brilliant timing. The book came out a month or two after the Seattle protests, which was the first time most people realized anything was happening, but Klein had been working on No Logo for four years by then. She was ahead of the game, and by being so she defined the terms of the debate. A counter-argument four years on is beside the point. And with an economist’s blinkers, Wolf completely ignores or dismisses as unimportant the cultural portions of Klein’s book: the intrusion of advertising and commercialism into all aspects of life, the erosion of public spaces (physical and otherwise), and so on.\nChild labour and sweatshop labour are other issues where Wolf does not see a problem. Wolf can see only one question of importance: is the wage paid by MNCs higher than that people would receive in their absence? If it is higher, then MNCs are to be applauded rather than derided. But there is another side to the story and it is to do with responsibility, proximity and culpability. If oppression is taking place on the other side of the world and has nothing to do with us, then there is little point to being angry. But if our neighbours become involved in oppression, then there is a chance that we can do something about it. The fact we can influence them makes action worthwhile even in the case that our neighbours’ oppression is slightly milder than the original. This seems an elementary ethical point, but Wolf and other economists (Paul Krugman for one) just don\u0026rsquo;t get it, instead dismissing this as some kind of moral queasiness rather than the practical concern that it is. Is this a result of his trade as a commentator or a cause of it? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but Wolf seems to have little idea of how social movements work or why they arise.\nBut despite that, most of us could usefully read more books that we disagree with, and this is a useful book for the anti-globalizer to read. It is not what its fans claim (“a devastating intellectual critique”) but it is a thorough and well-informed (comments on Naomi Klein and other occasional lapses aside) look at the economic issues. Just skip Chapters 1 to 8.\n","date":1140561885,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"82066237fd179bf86d4611425d7210ec","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/why_globalizati/","publishdate":"2006-02-21T22:44:45Z","relpermalink":"/post/why_globalizati/","section":"post","summary":"Finally finishing my notes on Martin Wolf’s book.

I’m reading it because it is a well-respected book putting the case in favour of globalization, a project I am in general opposed to (at least the way globalization is usually defined). It is a “brilliant book” (Lawrence Summers, President, Harvard University), a “devastating intellectual critique of the opponents of globalization” (Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England), and “a definitive analysis” (Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard University). Whether I’ll get around to part two of these notes is open to question.\nEvery academic discipline has its own way of putting itself at the centre of the world. Chemists point out that everything around us and inside us is made of chemicals. Physicists say that cosmology asks the only questions worth answering. Literary theorists say that there is nothing outside the text, and the interpreters of texts (ie themselves) are therefore the ones who bring meaning to the world. The economists’ version of this conceit is to claim that markets are responsible for all the good in the world. It is a conceit that Martin Wolf indulges in the early chapters of Why Globalization Works, and it shapes his argument in the rest of the book, so it is worth inspecting.\nWolf overreaches when setting out his claims, both in terms of what a market is and in terms of its centrality in the story of human progress.\nFor most of us, the market is that part of the capitalist system that involves commercial exchange. Such a definition involves two limitations. First, it defines “the market” in the sense that we usually use it, as part of capitalism: people have had markets for thousands of years, and yet when Adam Smith wrote about the wealth of nations it was not these markets that he was writing about. Second, it emphasizes that modern capitalist societies are many faceted, and some of these facets \u0026mdash; political democracy, the modern state, scientific research, and portions of culture, are nevertheless largely outside “the market”.\nWolf traces the origins of market-based wealth production back before the industrial revolution and the founding of capitalism, to a thousand years ago. He claims that we are living in “the millennium of the market” (p. 43) and as evidence of this points to the fact that population and economic growth started well before 1800. Yet correlation is not causation, and the existence (p 41) of commercial activity in China during the Sung dynasty (960 – 1279) does not demonstrate that markets have driven progress. Perhaps this is splitting hairs – the book is about the modern age after all – but I don’t think so. Wolf is setting the stage for an argument that an expansion of global markets is what we need, and if the stage is built on rickety foundations that argument cannot hold. There is little in his argument about “the millennium of the market” that is convincing.\nThe second way in which Wolf overreaches is of more immediately obvious importance. In talking about the role of the state in liberal democracies, Wolf conflates several meanings of “markets”. As I said above, to observer that we live in a capitalist society does not mean that all elements of our society are capitalist. We also live in a scientific society, a technological society, a cultural society, a welfare-state society and a hierarchical society – do these aspects of the world have a part to play too? What Wolf does in his discussion of market economies is to move back and forward between a narrow meaning of markets (capitalist exchange) and a broader meaning (the entire society of which it is a part), and the result is confusion.\nThis confusion is most obvious when Wolf discusses opposition to the market (pages 54 to 55). Wolf claims that “The market economy does not merely support its critics, it embraces them”. Here he is defining the market economy broadly enough to include those who oppose the actions of markets, and goes on to assert that markets breed freedom. Yet to look at the history of freedom in western Europe is to see a continual struggle to broaden franchises to include non-property owners, women, people of colour, and so on that was carried out by opponents of the property-owning classes, who would have been quite happy to keep things as they were. The growth of freedoms and rights within the workplace are also the result of countless years of cumulative struggle and pressure from workers. To simply say that “market economies” provide freedoms is insufficient, because Wolf is about to argue that we need to enlarge the scope of private industry, restrict the role of government, and (between the lines) remove bargaining levers that workers and the disenfranchised may have. The modern liberal democracy is the result of a continual pulling and pushing of many forces, of which the market is only one. Its future shape will be determined by the balance of power between all parts of society, not by the market alone. By presenting liberal democracies as “market economies”, as many economists do, Wolf underplays importance of those other forces.\nWolf’s portrayal of history has other lacunae. Repeatedly he defines one of the important roles of the state as providing security of property rights, so that long-term contracts can be made with assurance. Yet historically the role of the state at some crucial points in history has been to redistribute property. The enclosure movement in the early 19th century was an example of property rules being redefined, people being expelled from what was previously thought of as their property, in order for the land-owning classes to gain more land. This is not “security of property”. The same is apparently happening in modern-day China.\nMeanwhile, his view of the market portion of the economy is rose-tinted. He is casual about many market failures (pervasive asymmetric information problems are noted, but “Happily, there are solutions” – p 47). He sees innovation as a function located entirely within the private sphere: “innovation rather than price competition is the central feature of the market process” (p 51), “Innovation then does not come from outside the market. it is hard-wired into capitalism” . In considering these claims it is worth reflecting that some of the biggest innovations of recent years have come from national and international government actions taking place outside the market. The development of the Internet, surely one of the major technological innovations of the last 50 years, is one such: the networking mechanisms, the programming languages, and the web browsers on which it is built were developed largely in the labs of DARPA and the NCSA in the US, CERN in Europe, and AT\u0026amp;T (during the years in which it was a monopoly) in the US. The market may have helped to bring the fruits of the developments to consumers, but it did not make the big innovations. Yet such activities took place within market economies, and so Wolf attributes them to the market.\nIt is hardly surprising that he concludes that governments need only provide some assurances that business as usual can take place, and the entrepreneurs will innovate. Looking at the post-Soviet economies, one could also argue that if entrepreneurs are to innovate rather than to plunder the resources of their society, they must be prompted, cajoled, bribed, and funded by the state in order to do so.\nOne final gripe. In these early chapters Wolf lets his lack of respect for anti-globalization arguments come to the fore, and it doesn’t help his case. He dismisses the protestors as “spoiled children” (p 10). He quotes (p55) a passage from Naomi Klein’s _No Logo _(one that was also quoted in The Economist’s review of the book) as evidence that she indulges in “paranoid fantasies”. The quote in question starts in mid sentence, and the implied meaning is directly opposed to the actual meaning in Klein’s book, as she pointed out to _The Economist _when it first published the quotation. Elsewhere (p 11) he quotes a banner from a protest march “replace capitalism with something nicer” as an example of something that is not “the route to a tolerable future” \u0026mdash; as if a banner ever captures deep or subtle thoughts. Banners may be simple, but arguing against banners in a 400 page book is also. This is not honest argument.\nIn short, while setting up his argument for the remainder of the book, Martin Wolf paints a picture of the world that is undeniably broad-ranging and widely read, but which remains shallow and distorted. The positive qualities of innovation and freedom that he associates with markets are mainly qualities of modern liberal democracies as a whole, and are qualities with many diverse sources. The early chapters of his book are a statement of his point of view, and interesting as such, but they are not even handed and they are not convincing.\n**Update: **Part II is now posted.\n","date":1138723905,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"11d8b5ea575d5741ee308bbb5c08639a","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/why_globalizati-2/","publishdate":"2006-01-31T16:11:45Z","relpermalink":"/post/why_globalizati-2/","section":"post","summary":"This is part one of some notes taken while reading _Why Globalization Works _by Martin Wolf, and it covers parts I and II of the book.

An in-depth study of the free market in football confirms what Premiership fans have long suspected: the influx of overseas stars has improved skill levels but at the expense of growing inequality between the elite clubs and the rest.           Yet national teams of poor countries have benefited from mobility of labour says an article by Branko Milanovic in the latest Review of International Political Economy. Since the national teams of rich countries cannot buy the best in the way that their clubs can, when a Didier Drogba returns home from Chelsea, the Ivory Coast team gains from his experience.     Using basic economic theory, Milanovic came up with the hypothesis that putting a good player with other good players would lead to all of them becoming even better players - or increasing returns, in the jargon of the dismal science. Given that some clubs are richer than others, he says you would expect a small group of clubs to dominate.     At club level, this is precisely what has happened. A study of the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) showed that there used to be a far better chance of an unknown or unfashionable club making it to the last eight than now. In the five years from 1958 to 1962, 30 different teams made it to the quarter finals (out of a possible maximum of 40), but between 1998 and 2002 this had fallen to 22.     A separate study of Serie A - Italy's equivalent of the Premiership - told a similar story. From the 1960s to the 1990s, there used to be three or four clubs on average from the poorer regions of the south. In 2002, for the first time since the second world war, there was not a single club from the south in Serie A.     Sepp Blatter, the president of Fifa, has condemned the greed of the modern game and, in words that could have been uttered by an anti-globalisation protester, accused Europe's top clubs of conducting themselves increasingly as \"neo-colonialists\" indulging in \"economic rape\". At the international level, Fifa has maintained limits on the inequality generated by the \"leg drain\", preventing rich countries from buying the national teams of poor countries. As a result, poor countries are able to capture the benefits of higher skills acquired by their players abroad when they temporarily return home to play for their national squads.     Adopting Fifa's approach to the \"brain drain\" of skilled workers, the paper says, might mean that the doctors, nurses, teachers and scientists who emigrate to the west should be obliged to spend one year in five back in their home country.     Milanovic says the ability of poor countries to hold on to their best players has made the World Cup more open. In the late 1970s and 1980s it was highly unusual for a newcomer to make it to the last eight of the competition but each tournament since has thrown up at least of couple of newcomers - including Cameroon, Nigeria and Turkey - who have made life difficult for fancied teams. Matches, the economist adds, are also getting tighter, suggesting some nail-biting nights for England fans this summer as the spectre of the dreaded penalty shoot-out looms.     **·** Globalisation and goals: does Soccer show the way?

It had been that way for a long time, and it didn’t look like changing: fifty years had passed since any new ale breweries had been founded. Sure, some people complained about the poor quality of beer, but they were probably just dreaming about a non-existent golden age and grumbling about progress. After all, if cask beers from small breweries were really better than the brand-name, large-scale production of the big brewers, why had the small breweries gone out of business? If people really wanted a different kind of beer, surely companies would be competing to provide it for them?\nBut then a strange thing happened. As many people know, some of these grumblers got together to form the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). CAMRA held local beer festivals, published an annual Good Beer Guide, and local CAMRA groups published newsletters that helped to keep information as well as ale flowing. And they didn’t stop there: CAMRA campaigned for less restrictive pub licensing laws and selling practices, against takeovers of smaller breweries, and against deceptive advertising. CAMRA tries all kinds of tactics: “Lively and sometimes controversial campaigns are mounted at local level, with backup from headquarters. MPs, councillors, trade unions, licensees and workers might be involved. Tactics we have used include petitions, threatened boycotts, publicity stunts, marches, laying wreaths outside closed breweries and so forth.”\nCAMRA now boasts a membership of 75,000. Three hundred new breweries operate in the UK. The _Good Beer Guide _claims that “In spite of the best efforts of the global brewers who dominate British brewing, there is greater choice today than at any time since the … early 1970s.” CAMRA has changed the British beer landscape. It turns out that there was a demand for a different beer after all.\nWhy write about a thirty-year old British beer-drinkers organization? Because CAMRA’s success has a lot to tell us about the world we inhabit as consumers. It shines a light on one of the basic questions about our society: does a free market economy really give us what we want? Many areas of our consuming lives are dominated by a few big companies and their heavily advertised brands, just like the market for beer in Britain in 1970. And just like CAMRA, we can ask the question, does their success mean that we really like them?\nAnother way of asking this question is “who is in charge when it comes to brands?” There are two common answers. Here in the red corner representing the anti-corporate constituency is Naomi Klein, who argued five years ago in No Logo that brands provide a front for “corporate rule” and that we are being pushed around by “Brand bullies”. And over here in the blue corner representing the free-market enthusiasts is The Economist, which claims that “Brands do not rule consumers; consumers rule brands… When we like a brand we manifest our loyalty in cash. If we don’t like it, we walk away. Customers are in charge.”\nCAMRA showed that there is a third possibility. Enterprising landlords always had the right to set up “free houses” which could sell beer from any brewer. So although the big breweries made it easier to drink their beer than that of their smaller competitors, it is difficult to argue that beer drinkers were being bullied. On the other hand CAMRA’s success proves that the market was not giving people what they wanted: for many years, the British beer industry really did provide low-quality, albeit predictable, fare and got away with it.\nSome free-market enthusiasts would argue that CAMRA is simply the market at work, facilitating the sharing of information needed for the market to work properly. But are activist, volunteer groups setting out to discredit big companies (and with a Trotskyist ex-leader of the Socialist Workers’ Party playing a leading role) needed for markets to work well? If so, we are a far cry from the way that the invisible hand and consumer sovereignty is supposed to work.\nSo consumers were not being bullied, but they were still trapped by the big breweries. In principle they were in charge, but in order to be in charge you have to have a way to issue orders. Until CAMRA came along something was stopping British beer drinkers from demanding better beer and was keeping them in a bad-beer trap. But what?\nThe answer matters because although the CAMRA story is interesting—at least, I think it is—it would be interesting only in an anecdotal, “isn’t that odd” kind of way if it was only an exception to the rule. But there are good reasons to believe that the forces at work among British beer drinkers are working in a lot of other areas of our consuming lives. The CAMRA story is a tale of conflict between marketing-driven brand-name companies and smaller suppliers who have to rely on word of mouth for their success. It shows that the success of brands may not be a good thing, and it shows that individual choice and the market may not be enough to get us out of the various traps we find ourselves in.\nThe answer matters because faith in markets is now so widespread. It is commonplace to hear that if people are eating at McDonald’s while independent restaurants go out of business, or if people are watching American sitcom re-runs while Canadian productions can’t find funding, then—like it or not—this is a reflection of what consumers want. If we liked Canadian-made TV shows we’d watch them without any help from the CRTC. If we really cared about healthy downtowns, we wouldn’t be shopping at Wal-Mart. The argument is used as a verbal cudgel to beat those who argue for government intervention or who protest the global spread of brand-name companies and cultural homogeneity. Even Paul Krugman—New York Times columnist, fierce George Bush critic, and every US liberal’s favourite economist—argues that because “no one forces you to eat at McDonald’s”, anti-globalization activists are hoping that “individuals be prevented from getting what they want”.\nTo better understand the CAMRA story we turn to economist George Akerlof. Just before CAMRA was founded he had an insight that explains why markets often fail. Akerlof’s big idea is called “the market for lemons”—lemons as in bad quality cars, not as in the fruit—and it has had a huge impact on economics, winning him the Nobel Prize in 2002. Unlike some other big ideas it has not made the jump into the realm of public discussion. It is time it did so, because it has a lot to say about many of today’s most topical issues, including the conflict between the big brands and smaller vendors.\nAkerlof observed that, in many exchanges, buyers cannot tell the quality of what they buy before they buy it, while sellers know the quality of what they are selling. The used car market was his example; when you buy a used car direct from its owner it is hard to tell if it is in good shape or whether the brakes are just about to fail. On the other hand, sellers know how well they have maintained their cars and have a better idea of whether there is anything dodgy under the hood.\nIn situations like this, where one side knows more than the other, there is a problem of trust. Buyers of used cars must ask themselves the question “if he (or she) wants to sell that car, do I really want to buy it?”\nThe logic goes like this.\n Buyers will only pay a premium price if they are confident that they will get what they are paying for. If they can’t identify or verify quality then they will not offer top dollar because they know they might be buying a lemon instead (they can’t tell the difference). They don’t trust the seller.\n As buyers will not offer a high price, sellers of good quality used cars will tend to hold on to their vehicles rather than selling them at an unwarranted discount. They are driven out of the market.\n Realizing that sellers with good quality used cars will hold on to them, buyers will further lower the price they are prepared to offer. This drives the sellers of the second-best cars out of the market.\n The spiral continues and the market unravels until the only cars that can be sold are those for which the quality is certain: lemons.\n  The morals of the story are that markets where trust cannot be established are much less active than they would otherwise be—they are “thin”—and that it is particularly difficult to buy and sell high quality goods when their quality is not easily verified. Even when buyers would be happy to spend money for good quality merchandise, and even when sellers could make some money by providing it, the “lemons problem” means that many potentially beneficial exchanges fail to take place. There is no magic in the market that guarantees success for producers of good things unless they can establish a level of trust in what they are supplying.\nBut there is more to the lemons problem than this.\nIn many markets where trust is difficult to establish, there are “nearby” markets where it is less of a problem. The quality of a new car is more easily verifiable than that of a used car, because the seller can offer guarantees, and legally is held to account more than the private seller of a used car. Faced with a choice between a predictable new car and a second hand car that may be a lemon, the good choice is to go with the predictable.\nIt is not quite so simple, of course, as Akerlof knew very well. The market for lemons is both less than and more than the truth. On one hand, few goods are of completely unknown quality ahead of time: sellers can offer guarantees, and buyers can tease out information in many different ways. Plenty of used cars, even good quality ones, do get bought and sold. But on the other hand, the forces Akerlof identified are present to some extent in almost every market transaction. In fact, many aspects of consumer society are taken up with trying to get around this basic problem of establishing trustworthiness. Establishing trust is not impossible, but it is costly.\nHidden in the market for lemons is an explanation of why British beer could stay as low-quality for years, and of how CAMRA could give independent producers a chance to sell their products.\nThe competition between the big breweries and the independents in the UK was really a battle between two ways of establishing trustworthiness and reputation. Brands rely on direct communication to the consumer through large-scale marketing campaigns and an obvious uniformity, while the independents have to rely instead on word of mouth among an educated customer base to build their reputation.\nOnce the big breweries had tightened their hold on the market, small breweries were faced with an information Catch-22. They lacked a base of well-informed consumers to establish their reputation, and consumers lacked good quality products to be informed about. Consumers were not bullied, but they were trapped. In a market dominated by brands, individual consumer choices were not enough to re-establish a market for independent producers.\nWhat was needed, and what CAMRA provided, was collective action. A group of people who, by banding together, managed to give the market enough of a kick to propel it from one kind of outcome, dominated by brands and low customer information, to another in which better-informed drinkers could make better-informed decisions. CAMRA solved the lemons problem faced by independent breweries.\nMalcolm Gladwell’s hugely successful book The Tipping Point explains how word of mouth works. Gladwell takes his readers to meet a set of “connectors, mavens, and salesmen”. These are people who, because of a gregarious nature, or an inclination to collect information, or a natural persuasive ability, carry information about good and bad products to the rest of us and spark what Gladwell calls “word-of-mouth epidemics”. But powerful as these connectors are, and engaging as Gladwell’s book is, we cannot always trust that individuals will provide the information needed to sustain good products. Word-of-mouth information about a beer, or about a restaurant, or about a new book, requires a certain density of people who know about it to transmit the information to the rest of us, and even though Gladwell shows that a surprisingly small number of people can manage to be a conduit for a lot of information, a critical mass is still needed to reach the “tipping point”. In any particular market left to the vagaries of individual choices there is no guarantee that it will ever be reached.\nThe market for lemons means that brands can drive out word-of-mouth products as long as they are “good enough” to make the search for reliable information too costly. If a branded product can get a foothold in the market, it takes some customers out of the market for word-of-mouth goods. By doing so, it increases the cost of word-of-mouth information for all consumers and so makes the lemons problem a little worse. The effect is a spiral, with each turn cutting into the word-of-mouth culture that maintains independent producers and adding to the market share of brand-name companies.\nIn some cases, word of mouth can keep an independent market healthy, but in other cases brands drive word-of-mouth goods to the periphery, where only the most enthusiastic will even hear about them, or even eliminate them all together. The predictability of brand-name goods can literally dumb down the market, even if we continue to make good individual choices. Despite what The Economist says, a victory for brands does not prove a real “preference” by individual consumers. It may simply show that the brand is no so bad that it is worth the effort of finding out about alternatives.\nDespite its recent woes, McDonald’s is a brand archetype. McDonald’s restaurants scream predictability, from the identikit restaurant design to the employees’ uniforms and scripted dialogue (“would you like fries with that?”) to the production-line cooking techniques to the global marketing efforts. A tourist in a new city may never have heard of any of the local restaurants, and may not know their quality, but certainly does know what the food will be like at McDonald’s. It may not be great, but it is “good enough”. Food in some tourist areas is notoriously bad because the repeat business needed to establish a reputation for quality is just not there. Restaurants that provide good value cannot find a market for the food they sell. Such areas are prime territory for the guaranteed predictability of the franchise.\nRon Galloway, director of the new film Why Wal-Mart Works \u0026amp; Why That Makes Some People Crazy, claims that \u0026ldquo;138 million people vote with their feet to go to Wal-Mart. And Americans are pretty smart. And I think Wal-Mart, if Wal-Mart were really doing something genuinely wrong, the American people would be able to figure it out and not go.\u0026rdquo; But it has nothing to do with how smart we are as individuals. Instead, it is simply that in the face of the economies of scale and large-scale marketing, maintaining knowledge about alternatives becomes increasingly difficult.\nOnce you see how the market for lemons works, less obvious examples are all around. Networking is often a vital step in getting a good job. The ability of “old boys clubs” and networks based on common universities and schools has sustained many an insider group, and outsiders (women, racial minorities) who do not have access to these networks can be excluded, even when the people doing the hiring have no intention to discriminate. It simply makes good sense to choose the known over the unknown. The market for lemons is an argument in favour of affirmative action: even the most well-intentioned hiring procedure that is based on information about the individual can leave us with well-connected but only “good enough” people in good jobs, while potentially excellent candidates without good connections can be left in the cold.\nGetting credit to start a company is another area where contacts are important. Investors and banks look for real evidence that a loan can be repaid, and personal recommendations or contacts provide an invaluable source of such evidence. Those from the wrong side of the track looking for a loan to start a company may have to look long and hard, no matter how good their ideas are.\nOr how about the market for movies? We have heard a lot about the increased availability of online review sites and other ways of finding information at your fingertips. Such developments are real, but let’s not forget the other side of the story. New technology also allows producers to “open wide” in many theatres simultaneously following a barrage of publicity, so making word of mouth information more difficult to get. This provides a way of promoting a brand-based predictability. The inclusion of bankable stars and the production of sequels are other ways of emphasizing the reliability of the product and cutting into the influence of word of mouth.\nAny market where there are “acquired tastes” is vulnerable to being dumbed down by brands. The phrase “acquired tastes” suggests fine wines and smelly cheeses, but CAMRA shows that the phrase applies just as much to cheaper products. Groups of enthusiasts help to keep such areas alive, and play a fundamental role in maintaining variety. At the high end, gourmet groups may manage to maintain a flow of information so that independent producers (“boutique” products) can still find a niche without being as militant as CAMRA. At the other end of the market, it is unlikely at this stage that a real market for locally-produced soft drinks can be re-established: the cheapness of the mass-produced product means that any independent variant must be substantially better to make it worth searching out.\nSeen in this light, collective action among consumers becomes all the more important. And brand-name companies are aware of this. As the success of consumer campaigns such as those against Nike and Nestlé have shown, people do take information into account when they make their decisions, as long as that information is available. But it requires collective action to make this information available to individual consumers, and to make it part of how we decide what to buy and what not to buy.\nIf we continue to trust more and more areas of society to the supposed power of individual consumer choice, there is no guarantee that we will end up in a good place. The success of brand-name companies is no evidence of popularity. There continues to be a need for people to band together. Such efforts can have an effect, as CAMRA has done, and make us collectively smarter.\n","date":1137168182,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"cd26c806d59959b8b5529e1861f43b3d","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/learning_by_dri/","publishdate":"2006-01-13T16:03:02Z","relpermalink":"/post/learning_by_dri/","section":"post","summary":"An article I am working on, hoping to publish somewhere\u0026hellip;\nOnce upon a time, 35 years ago to be precise, the British beer industry was dominated by five big breweries.

It is a group blog run by proponents of Free-Market Environmentalism (FME). This is not something that I would expect to agree with, but not a strand of thought I have looked at much, so I read over their \u0026ldquo;About Free-Market Environmentalism\u0026rdquo; page and a book review of David Roodman (of the Worldwatch Institute)\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Natural Wealth of Nations\u0026rdquo;.\n(the trackback is to the latest post on their blog, because I can\u0026rsquo;t trackback to the home page).\nIt is not news that, in the search for ways to control environmental damage, one of the routes that is being tried is that of markets. Emissions trading schemes for greenhouse gases and sulphur dioxide are prominent examples. Fine, I say \u0026ndash; whatever works in cutting down pollution. I have no particular axe to grind for or against the use of markets in this way. I imagine they will work well in some cases (easily tracked gases that become widely distributed), and not in others (difficult to track pollutants, or pollutants that are local (such as mercury) for which a market may lead to very polluted \u0026ldquo;hot spots\u0026rdquo;.\nBut this is not what FME is about. They argue that using markets \u0026ldquo;simply as tools for the fficient delivery of environmental goals\u0026hellip; [while] the goals themselves remain collectively determined\u0026rdquo; is simple market socialism. Instead, they want to use markets as a way of \u0026ldquo;determining what is to be done\u0026rdquo; as well as how it should be accomplished.\nThe basic premise is that private ownership provides the incentive needed for conservation: \u0026ldquo;The record of private owners in conserving resources is superior to that of government agencies\u0026rdquo;. And there are certainly cases of well-preserved or conserved resources that you can find. The beautiful picture on the commons blog front page of the Natural Bridge of Virginia is an example. But a bridge is one thing, and not perhaps typical. To extrapolate these concrete, easily identified objects to \u0026ldquo;property rights\u0026rdquo; in such things as dioxins and blue whales is a big step, and not one they convince me can be made.\nLet me give a few reasons why they fail to convince me.\nOne issue is that they have a cavalier attitude to the nature of environmental problems.\n Resources? \u0026ldquo;There is little reason to fear running out of oil or mineral resources, for prices will rise well before stocks expire\u0026rdquo;.\n Sulphur dioxide and acid rain? \u0026ldquo;But was a sulfur oxide emission reduction plan needed at all? The most extensive US study of acid rain to date suggests that acid rain was not a substantial threat to forests and streams, despite environmentalist claims to the contrary.\u0026rdquo;\n Climate change? A whole series of articles on the blog suggests that the position of FME is that this too is not much of a problem.\n  There is a collective action problem to be overcome when it comes to collecting the information on which environmental action is predicated. Groups that help to overcome this problem seem to me to be either government sponsored or to be enthusiasts (bird watchers, for example, who track bird numbers over time) \u0026ndash; neither of which is a market-based approach. So the fact that they are dubious about a whole raft of environmental assessments makes me think that their \u0026ldquo;leave it to the market\u0026rdquo; approach to establishing environmental goals \u0026ndash; which ignores this collective action problem \u0026ndash; is not one they are particularly concerned with, because when it comes to it they don\u0026rsquo;t think the problems are that big.\nA second reason is an impression that the FME outlook is, in the end, more about getting rid of government activity than about the environment per se. Their worldview is one in which the only two players are government bureaucracies and markets. And they rule out government point blank: \u0026ldquo;It was the fatal conceit of socialism, in Hayek\u0026rsquo;s famous phrase, that wise government bureaucrats could guide society to a better future. Substituting red aspirations with green ones does not change the undertaking\u0026rsquo;s essential nature - or its likelihood of success.\u0026rdquo; This leads to odd judgement calls. On the one hand, designing a (Pigouvian) tax code \u0026ldquo;that fully and accurately internalizes negative environmental externalities (forget the positive) is a fool\u0026rsquo;s errand. It requires \u0026ldquo;impossibly detailed knowledge\u0026rdquo;. On the other hand, when it comes to establishing property rights \u0026ldquo;the technical requirements of property rights definition and enforcement are also substantial\u0026rdquo; - and yet they are optimistic that the market can deal with them, even though they require the same \u0026ldquo;impossibly detailed knowledge\u0026rdquo; that the tax approach does.\nA third reason that they don\u0026rsquo;t convince me is that their tone is too often smug. They are preaching to the converted. The pervasive use of \u0026ldquo;government bureaucrats\u0026rdquo; serves only to emphasize their lack of efficiency. The suggestion that the collapse of the Eastern Bloc demonstrates the failure of any role for the state once and for all (\u0026ldquo;Central planning has clearly failed.\u0026rdquo;) In the book review (see top of this post) they start off by saying \u0026ldquo;We are all free-market environmentalists now\u0026rdquo; before going on to claim that Worldwatch is merely \u0026ldquo;faux-market\u0026rdquo;. Or categorizing Worldwatch as being \u0026ldquo;like so many others that mouth adherence to market strategies\u0026rdquo;. Such digs are everywhere, and they don\u0026rsquo;t help.\nA fourth reason, they slide by some of the problems of private ownership, while overestimating the problems of public ownership. It is easy to say that \u0026ldquo;behind every tree should stand an owner who can act as its protector\u0026rdquo; but you can\u0026rsquo;t really say the same about a salmon that swims thousands of miles. And while they like to quote Garrett Hardin about the failure of collective ownership they seem to neglect the well-know fact that many instances of collective ownership have succeeded well (Elinor Ostrom and others having catalogued lots of these). And they don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to the argument by CW Clarke that it may make perfect economic sense for a single fishing body to drive whale populations to extinction even in the absence of a commons.\nFinally, they use the passive voice trick a lot to mask some real difficulties with their program. That is, they slip into the passive voice and so obscure just who is meant to be the active role in an activity. I suspect this is not deliberate, but it is revealing anyway. For example: \u0026ldquo;In a true market system the involuntary imposition of waste streams by one party onto others would be forbidden\u0026rdquo;. By whom? I suspect they know it must be the state, but can\u0026rsquo;t get themselves to say so. The drive (of private industry) to reduce costs results in pollution only \u0026ldquo;when property rights are insufficiently protected\u0026rdquo;. But who is to do the protection? And when it comes to automobile air pollution \u0026ldquo;An owner would be assessed a fee proportional to the amout of pollution his auto generated\u0026rdquo;. Who is to assess the fee? and who is to determine the amount of pollution generated?\nThese slips do suggest that in some ways FME has more overlap with other environmentalists than they would like to admit. Activities such as purchasing of wildlife reserves by the Audubon Society in the USA or compensating farmers to ease the reintroduction of wolves into Montana are apparently part of the free market, but I suspect there are few environmentalists who would argue against them. And to lump the activities of volunteer groups into the \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; realm is itself problematice \u0026ndash; such collective groups are typically neither of the state nor of the market, and the FME attempt to claim them is unfounded. If that\u0026rsquo;s what FME is really arguing for, OK, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that big an intellectual deal.\n","date":1136071315,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"923d9ea24df2add87f9470c65ab20370","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/the_commons_blo/","publishdate":"2005-12-31T23:21:55Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_commons_blo/","section":"post","summary":"I have spent some time this afternoon at The Commons Blog, subtitled \u0026ldquo;Markets Protecting the Environment\u0026rdquo;.

So when a U.S. company patented a process for producing the substance in 1994, India reacted with outrage.     After spending millions of dollars in legal fees to successfully overturn the patent, India's government is now creating a 30-million-page database of traditional knowledge to fend off entrepreneurs trying to patent the country's ancient lore.     India is not alone in worrying about \"bio-prospectors\" profiting from the genetic resources of its plant life with no benefit to its people.     It joined with China, Brazil and nine other countries a few years ago to begin pushing for international protections.     The database project already has caught the interest of others. A South African team recently visited and a Mongolian mission is coming in January, said V.K. Gupta, chairman of India's National Institute for Science Communication and Information Resources.     The database, called the Traditional Knowledge Data Library (TKDL), will make information available to patent offices around the world to ensure that traditional remedies are not presented as new discoveries.     \"If societies have been using it for centuries why should it be patented?\" said Shiv Basant, a senior official at the Health Ministry's Department of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy, India's traditional health and medical disciplines.     The government has also successfully challenged patents on the use of the spice turmeric to heal wounds and rashes and a patent on a rice strain derived from India's famed Basmati rice.     But that is a tiny fraction of the problem.     A 2003 study by Mr. Gupta's institute estimated that about 7,000 patents worldwide are based on indigenous Indian knowledge, far too many for India to challenge in expensive legal fights.     Officials hope the database will head off future battles.     \"If we have all the data in TKDL, we will not have to spend all those millions of dollars,\" said Ajay Dua of the Commerce Ministry's Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.     Currently it is difficult for overseas patent office researchers to prove purported innovations are really based on old lore because, while the information is widely published in India, it is often in ancient languages such as Sanskrit or modern regional languages like Tamil.     \"We decided we have to break the language and access barrier,\" Mr. Gupta said.     He convened a group of 150 experts in traditional medicine, scientists, doctors, patent lawyers and computer programmers to put together the database of traditional knowledge.     Instead of laboriously translating the manuscripts, the scholars structured the texts into classifications widely used by patent examiners.     The texts are then entered in the database, where specially developed software translates them into Hindi, English, German, French, Japanese and Spanish.     \"We created knowledge conversion software that converts local names of diseases and plants into modern names,\" Mr. Gupta said.     More than 1,500 yoga poses have been catalogued, too.     That's because yoga poses also have been patented, often by Indians who are living abroad, Mr. Basant said.     A patent researcher can search the database using key words or phrases.     So if the plant aloe vera is entered, the traditional term Kumari will come up with a list of its known medicinal uses.     More than 10 million pages already have been loaded into the system and 20 million more will be available by the end of 2006, Mr. Gupta said.     Several international patent offices have applied for access to the database and it will be made available to them as soon as the group finishes establishing technological and legal safeguards to prevent the knowledge from being wrongly exploited, he said.    Vandana Shiva has written a lot about Biopiracy, and this story is a next chapter to some things in her book of the same name. I have not followed the Indian and Pakistani governments\u0026rsquo; activities in challenging patents on long-known non-innovations, such as Neem fungicides, Basmati rice and Nap Hal wheat. The use of the patent system as a way of enclosing the intellectual commons (as Shiva describes it) illustrates just how distinct the notions of competitive markets and capitalist markets (which are commonly conflated) really are.\n","date":1135634825,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"d400655d254a70e9fc9b78562e29c1db","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/india_creates_d/","publishdate":"2005-12-26T22:07:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/india_creates_d/","section":"post","summary":"A fine initiative reported in today\u0026rsquo;s Globe and Mail\nFor thousands of years, Indian villagers have used an extract from seeds of the neem tree as an insecticide.

This is not surprising given his enthusiasm for Markets Everywhere. Most of the comments address the empirical aspects of one particular case, which is the insurance industry. But while I can\u0026rsquo;t get at the papers he references (they are behind the institutional subscriber firewall) I think there is a more general issue here about asymmetric information.\nFor me, the key line in the post is this:\nYou can buy a decent used car, for example just get it inspected or certified. Only if such adjustments are illegal, or in some other way not allowed, will adverse selection become important.    But the whole thing about asymmetric information is surely that information is not non-existent, but it is costly. No one thinks that the lemons scenario is more than a first-order approximation, and signalling and screening make second-order corrections, but the problem may still remain and be important. The information problem becomes central to the whole practice of the industry, as anyone reading an insurance contract will know. Alex Tabarrok is very close to saying that costs can be neglected as long as adjustments are \u0026ldquo;illegal, or in some other way not allowed\u0026rdquo;. This claim that transaction costs are unimportant seems to be one of the dividing lines between market enthusiasts (AT) and market sceptics (me).\nWhat is more, there is often a collective action problem in obtaining that information that is particularly important when the buyers are those who are ill-informed. When the seller is ill-informed, it may be the case that they can compensate: I think that Alex Tabarrok is right that, for example, the insurance company knows as much about my life expectancy as I do, and I know considerably less about the details of my coverage than they do. I would say that in this case overcoming asymmetric information becomes a fixed cost, leading to economies of scale in the insurance industry (which at least in Canada is an oligopoly with fewer members by the year) and leading to market failures of a variety of types. On the other hand, when the consumer is ill-informed, the collective action problem is real.\nMy favourite example of an asymmetric information problem comes from beer-drinking in the UK. Small independent breweries have no mechanism for establishing a reputation (and thereby overcoming the lemons problem) unless there is a critical mass of well-informed beer drinkers who will transmit that reputation to others. In the 1970\u0026rsquo;s the beer industry in the UK was in a\nCatch-22 that is typical of asymmetric information problems: there was no demand for real ale because there was no supply, and there was no supply because there was no demand. The big breweries offered low quality, but predictability. AT would have claimed, I believe, that the market was working.\nThe problem has been resolved to some extent by the efforts of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), who included a prominent Trotskyist in their leadership and had a strong anti-big-business slant. Their efforts have led to 300 new breweries being set up, while in the 50 years before their formation not one was founded. CAMRA has moved the equilibrium in the market, which is presumably evidence that it was failing before. And unless AT is prepared to\naccept anti-business volunteer lobbying and protest groups in the requirements for a properly functioning market, it would seem that the problem was fixed by a successful organization overcoming the collective action problem.\nSo yes, I think asymmetric information, including adverse selection, is really a problem in many markets.\nUpdate: on asymmetrical information in insurance, see December 18th\u0026rsquo;s Dilbert.\n","date":1134465264,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"e0f66fff9fbc2cb4bf3065eae717bda2","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/marginal_revolu-2/","publishdate":"2005-12-13T09:14:24Z","relpermalink":"/post/marginal_revolu-2/","section":"post","summary":"Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution claims that Adverse selection is NOT the problem.

She writes it well, as you would expect from the author of \u0026ldquo;We Need to Talk About Kevin\u0026rdquo;.\n**Books make good gifts this year,** since discounts offered by UK chains are now as drastic as 50%. But don't imagine that high-street behemoths alone are sacrificing for the affordability of your winter presents. Publishers are out of pocket, as are authors like me. Discount deals in trade for volume are not yet as unsustainable as in the dairy industry; the 17p per litre that supermarkets pay for milk is often less than it costs to produce. But publishing has become less profitable, and so has writing books.     I don't know what the answer is. Wal-Mart-writ-large seems the natural end point of capitalism, which thrives on economies of scale. With the clout to demand rock-bottom prices from suppliers and pass the savings to customers, big fish eat little fish until the commercial ocean floats only a few whales. Hence the local greengrocer gives way to Sainsbury's, the family-owned hardware store to Home Depot, the independent bookseller to Waterstone's (now mounting a take-over bid for Ottakar's). Alan Bennett's appeal to buy his book from independents is laudable but unrealistic. I can't ask prospective buyers of my own novels to pay full-price, when I purchase most books on Amazon myself. Aside from a few toffs who spurn the ambience of the cut-rate, we're all going to buy our milk, nails, and hardbacks where they're cheapest.     In the big picture, everyone is the poorer when producers and employees are low-balled, and thus pump less money into the economy. But who shops with an eye to the big picture? In the short-term, Wal-mart employees are so poorly paid that the only place they can afford to shop is Wal-mart.    This is pretty much exactly the argument I make in Chapter 1.

If we all expect each other to come back, we will. If we don\u0026rsquo;t, we won\u0026rsquo;t. But achieving this coordination in the circumstances of New Orleans seems impossible.\u0026rdquo;\nThe LA Times interviews one woman who is trying to decide whether to return and rebuild or to just move out. She would like to rebuild, but only if she would be surrounded by a neighbourhood. There is no sense rebuilding in a wasteland:\nAs a work crew gutted 1249 Granada Drive on Monday, heaping appliances, sofas and sheetrock in a 6-foot pile on the curb, Laurie Vignaud suddenly realized her only evidence that any of her neighbors had returned since Katrina was similar heaps outside their houses.    But do those piles mean that Granada Drive residents are ready to rebuild, or simply are picking through the wreckage and trying to buy time by stopping the mold's spread?    \"I keep looking at all this stuff and wondering whether they're coming back or not,\" said Vignaud. \"It's crazy, like a riddle I can't solve.\"    What is needed here is co-ordinated, collective action rather than individual, market-like behaviour. And those communities that have ways of co-ordinating such activity are the ones who are returning:\nIn fact, a few neighborhoods appear to have solved the riddle, or at least to have taken a good run at it. But the ways in which they have says much about the daunting dimensions of the problem facing the rest of the city.    On the northern edge of the city is New Orleans' Greek Orthodox community and its church, Holy Trinity Cathedral. As warnings about Katrina grew darker in the days before the storm, community leaders matched up families to whisk the elderly and infirm out of danger. In the days immediately after, they mobilized to come back again.    \"We ran it like a business,\" said John D. Georges, the parish council president and chief executive of Imperial Trading Co., a regional supplier of convenience stores.    Father Anthony Stratis worked the phones and sent out e-mails to find parishioners. Parish council member Dr. Nick Moustoukas followed up by wiring money to the neediest. Ten days after the storm, Georges and council member Christ Kanellakis helicoptered in to rescue the church's chalice and tabernacle.    By acting in concert, members of the Greek community have in effect provided each other with an immense self-insurance policy, guaranteeing that if one family rebuilds, others will. And, should more enticement be needed, the church, according to Georges, Moustoukas and others, is providing returning families with thousands of dollars of cash aid, has organized bulk purchases of new appliances and has arranged for crews that repaired the cathedral to be introduced to people whose houses are in need of work.    By the time the cathedral reopens for its first full service in two weeks, its marble interior walls will have been repaired, its lawn will have been resodded and Holy Trinity will be back in business.    The second way in which individual choice may go wrong in New Orleans is not so much about the relationship among the citizens of the city, it is more about the relationship between citizens and government. If citizens are to return, they need a commitment from the government that the city will be made safe. Meanwhile. the government is backing off:\n\"If they put back good levees to the [Category 3] level authorized before Katrina and we can get a commitment to build them slowly up to Category 5, people will come back,\" said Walter Isaacson, a News Orleans native, former editor of Time magazine, former chairman of CNN and co-chairman of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, a new state board appointed by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco to oversee reconstruction. \"It won't be a purely rational decision, but they'll come.\"     But the corps has made it clear that it has no intention of making any such grand commitment soon.    In part, the problem is cost; estimates of what it would cost to bring the city's levees up to Category 5 range from $4 billion to more than $30 billion. In addition, the corps' budget is perhaps the most closely controlled of any in the federal government, with Congress ear-marking almost every dollar to particular projects, leaving the corps little maneuvering room.    But there also appears to be a sense among senior corps officials that local demands for greater protection, if indulged, would be unceasing.    \"It's of interest to me,\" New Orleans district commander Col. Richard P. Wagenaar told the Los Angeles Times several weeks ago, \"that all the political leaders, all the business leaders and all the homeowners were all perfectly comfortable with the system on Aug. 28,\" the day before Katrina made landfall. \"They knew full well it was being built to Category 3, and everybody was fine with that,\" he said.    But when a storm of greater strength struck and overwhelmed the levees, Wagenaar said, people \"suddenly wanted to look back and say, 'Hey, what happened?' \" The implication: When would calls for still more ever end?    The concern is apparently one of moral hazard, that by investing in New Orleans the agencies will simply encourage demands for more. I have no way of knowing if there is any basis whatsoever to the concerns (although in other circumstances, such as health care, the concern is overrated as Malcolm Gladwell recently explained). But it is clear that without a real commitment from the government, New Orleans won\u0026rsquo;t rebuild quickly.\nThis is what happens when you have a government who doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe that governments can be useful. It is too bad.\n","date":1133855530,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"284da4d5e67e89f692927d52e40f62e5","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/on_their_own_in/","publishdate":"2005-12-06T07:52:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/on_their_own_in/","section":"post","summary":"Via Brad DeLong, an essay in the Los Angeles Times about the difficulties of reconstruction in New Orleans: On Their Own in Battered New Orleans - Los Angeles Times.\nThe article picks up on two ways in which sensible individual choices may lead to very different outcomes.\nWhat seems to have happened is that the US government has decided that the free market will take care of rebuilding New Orleans, as \u0026ldquo;the agencies that were stepping up to help guide the city\u0026rsquo;s comeback have stepped back down again\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;[t]o an extent almost inconceivable a few months ago, the only real actors in the rebuilding drama at the moment are the city\u0026rsquo;s homeowners and business owners.","tags":null,"title":"\n\t\t\t\tOn Their Own in Battered New Orleans - Los Angeles Times\t\t","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The number amd variety of things you can plug into the USB port on a computer is getting ridiculous.

It's very similar to get promoted or get out in the military. If you don't make a certain rank by a certain age, they ask you to retire.    The reason is increasing returns (in the form of fixed costs) in the book publishing industry:\nThe reason publishers want zillion copy sellers from one writer instead of ten writers each selling one-tenth of a zillion is because of unit cost.    Unit cost is the cost of each book sold. Add up all the cost for printing, editorial time, design time, and a percentage of the fixed cost like heats light and water and voila and voila: what it costs to make a book happen. That cost is almost same if you sell 3000 books or 30000 books.    The end result of increasing returns is a winner-take-all market. It is the search for the next blockbuster rather than the building of a set of steady sales. It is wealthies woman in Britain if you write Harry Potter and zilch otherwise. And it is not healthy for book readers.\nThe point is confirmed by a piece in the December edition of Quill \u0026amp; Quire, in which agent Denise Bukowski argues that \u0026ldquo;There has been a sea change in the fiction marketplace\u0026rdquo; in which life is getting tougher for most mid-level and even good-selling authors.\nFact: Foreign rights to American novelist Edward P.

Picador finally picked it up for a pittance as a paperback original, after it won the prize.    The reason is partly the big chain structure of today\u0026rsquo;s book industry.\nAnd in the U.K. one bookselling chain rules the market, and one man does all the buying for it: he has refused publishers' sales reps access to his stores. Consquentuly, many boks are available in the U.K. over the Inernet.    I presume she is referring to Waterstone\u0026rsquo;s.

Home Office Minister Hazel Blears doesn't think it will: she has said that she can't predict how the courts will act. Better safe than sorry, is the implication.    The inevitable consequence for literature - as many others have pointed out - will be that publishing decisions will increasingly be made not by editors, as they used to be; nor by accountants, as they now are; but by lawyers. And my learned friends will be throwing the pall of their caution over the theatre as well, to the impoverishment of all of us.    Pullman is on the money. There is, however, a missing piece here, or at least one that is not explicitly brought to the fore. In their brilliant description of Economics and Identity (which I describe in Chapter 11 of The Book), George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton bring ideas of identity into game theory and economics. Their model emphasizes how \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; comes with a set of \u0026ldquo;prescriptions\u0026rdquo;, which indicate the behaviour that is appropriate for someone of a given identity, or the ideal behaviour associated with a given identity.\nDepending on the circumstance, someone may identify themselves in different ways \u0026ndash; by gender, by profession, by religion. The prescriptions associated with these identities depend on the circumstace, but they are rules that are internalized, and there is a cost in the form of anxiety when the rules are violated.\nSo in addition to what you are and what you do, there is also the matter of what \u0026ldquo;people like you\u0026rdquo; do \u0026ndash; the rules associated with your identity. And it is in this area that much of the debate over religion comes. To criticize a religion is to criticize its prescriptions \u0026ndash; whether this means that Catholics should not divorce or Sikhs should cover their head, or one of a myriad of others. The struggle within many religions over \u0026ldquo;what it means to be Muslim/Christian/whatever\u0026rdquo; is a struggle over alternative sets of prescriptions. It is insufficient to say this is \u0026ldquo;what you do\u0026rdquo; because once the prescriptions are internalized there is a real cost to not following the rules. The prescriptions are what connects \u0026ldquo;what you are\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;what you do\u0026rdquo;.\nSo Pullman has it almost right, but not quite. It is, as he says, \u0026ldquo;all very complicated\u0026rdquo; and it is essential, as he says, that debate over \u0026ldquo;what it means to be\u0026rdquo; of one religion or another (or one nationality or another, and so on) continue without censorship, but it would be simplistic to suggest that criticisms of \u0026ldquo;what people do\u0026rdquo; can be made separately from criticisms of \u0026ldquo;what people are.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1132615772,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561838295,"objectID":"35cea6b5c885a98a365d5f35d1bb14dc","permalink":"https://tomslee.github.io/post/identity_crisis/","publishdate":"2005-11-21T23:29:32Z","relpermalink":"/post/identity_crisis/","section":"post","summary":"Philip Pullman\u0026rsquo;s essay as part of The Guardian\u0026rsquo;s piece on the possibility of laws to curb the promotion of religious hatred is, like much of what he writes, thought provoking and original.

She says:\nRe Margaret Wente's Disabled Kids Are The Abortion Debate No One Wants To Have (Nov. 17): Whatever our view of the ethics at the individual level of parents-to-be screening their embryos and fetuses for genetic and developmental abnormalities and discarding those that are genetically or developmentally \"defective,\" these decisions at a societal level will have the effect of wiping out certain groups of people, such as those with Down syndrome or achondroplasia (dwarfism), or who are profoundly deaf or manic-depressive.     And as genetic knowledge expands, other groups are likely to be reduced. Female embryos and fetuses are already being eliminated, and some fear a similar fate if the genes for homosexuality are identified. The cumulative effect of individual decision-making is wiping out certain groups, a situation that would never be tolerated as public policy.     Are we creating a \"new eugenics\" -- deliberately eliminating genetically undesirable people from society? Those favouring screening finesse this question by arguing that an individual's choice regarding the nature of their child is not a eugenic decision and comes with their \"absolute right to reproductive autonomy\". They say eugenics is practised only when a choice is made in relation to a group or class or by someone who's not the future parent. But is that sophistry?     And where the government supports screening programs to avoid, as a recent article in the medical journal The Lancet euphemistically puts it, \"live-born children with preventable physical or metnal handicaps,\" is this really the adoption of public policy of eugenics?    I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pretend to know how to balance this particular tension between individual reproductive rights and the collective consequences of individual choice, but I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine there is a clean solution to this messy problem.
