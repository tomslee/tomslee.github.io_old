      <p>For family reasons I&rsquo;ve been looking at university scholarships. There
are those that you get if you have a certain average, and then there
are others that you have to apply for and which usually involve a
mixture of scholarship and &ldquo;other stuff&rdquo;. And that &ldquo;other stuff&rdquo; is
almost always defined as &ldquo;leadership&rdquo;. Like the Lo Family scholarship
at the University of Toronto
(<a href="http://www.adm.utoronto.ca/awd/scholarships.htm#UTscholars):">http://www.adm.utoronto.ca/awd/scholarships.htm#UTscholars):</a></p>
<blockquote>"Awarded to students who are active as leaders, are respected and considered to be well-rounded citizens in their
school and community..."
> 
> </blockquote>
<p>Or at Queen&rsquo;s University, the D &amp; R Sobey Atlantic Scholarship requires
&ldquo;Academic excellence, proven leadership and involvement in school or
community activities.&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.queensu.ca/registrar/awards/apply/apply-scholar.html)">http://www.queensu.ca/registrar/awards/apply/apply-scholar.html)</a>. You
get the idea. Of course there are exceptions (like the lovely John
Macara (Barrister) award at U of T: &ldquo;Preference given to
applicants who can establish that they are the blood kin of the late
Mrs. Jean Glasgow, the donor of this award.&quot;) but most of the time it&rsquo;s
all about the leadership.</p>
<p>Now
I have nothing against leaders &ndash; all successful groups need someone to
take credit for their accomplishments &ndash; but this focus on
leadership to the exclusion of all else is a crock. Apart from
being ill-defined, it does a pretty good job of saying to those 17 and
18 year olds out there that there&rsquo;s only one kind of admirable person
in the world, and that&rsquo;s those who join lots of things, play sports
(preferably as captain or quarterback), and Get Involved. Do we really
want a world full of the parentally-pushed, self-important,
power-hungry egotists who fill &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; positions as teenagers?</p>
<p>So,
free of charge and in search of a better future for all of us, here is
a list of scholarships I&rsquo;d like to see adopted by universities:</p>
<p>The Wordsworth Scholarship: awarded
to students who have shown that they deeply appreciate the world around
them and pursue independent expression of their thoughts, regardless of
peer pressure.<br>
Documentation required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tear-stained copy of a letter of rejection by a former girlfriend/boyfriend</li>
<li>A notebook filled with juvenile poems</li>
<li>Letter banning you from school spirit club</li>
</ul>
<p>The entrance exam will require you to sit still, in complete silence, for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The Paddy Clarke Initiative Award: awarded to students with demonstrated ability to take responsibility for their own lives.<br>
Qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have lived in a two-parent home for less than half their childhood.</li>
<li>Must have moved out of home at least once during their teenage years. Preference given to those who have lived in a squat.</li>
<li>Preference will be given to those convicted of shop-lifting, as long as the theft was for a demonstrably useful object.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Larkin Scholarship: awarded to middle-class students with regular parents, who have never travelled abroad. Qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must own and wear bicycle clips regularly</li>
<li>Attendance at church or other religious institution preferred. Belief not necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Perec Prize: awarded to students who have demonstrated precocity in the realm of obscure puzzles and word games.<br>
Qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>An essay is required which must include all of the following:</li>
<li>a list of at least 24 related items</li>
<li>a meal that is all one colour</li>
<li>a mathematical theorem<br>
The essay must have no hypothesis or conclusion, but must include at least three words that contain all the vowels in reverse order.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bookworm Scholarship: awarded
to students who have demonstrated intellectual curiosity by exploring
the the world they live in through the medium of books.<br>
Documentation required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dog eared copy of at least three major works of literature.</li>
<li>Must have read at least two books banned by major school boards.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to articulate your ideas clearly demonstrates that you
really don&rsquo;t understand the complexity of the world and will exclude
you from this scholarship.</p>
